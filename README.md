# Pakistan Economy Dashboard

## Overview
I previously designed dashboards in Tableau, but I wanted to challenge myself by creating one using a Python library called **Panel**. I have a deep interest in economics, particularly concerning my home country of Pakistan, which at the time was experiencing significant political upheaval. This motivated me to create a comparison of economic performance across different governments. The dashboard served as both a succinct presentation of economic data and an opportunity to learn a new skill by building it in Python.

The economic metrics I selected included key quantitative indicators such as **exports, GDP, and exchange rate**, as well as qualitative measures like **Happiness Index, Competitiveness Ranking, and Corruption Perception Index**. Together, these metrics offer a comprehensive view of the country’s economic performance, providing both a data-driven and qualitative perspective.

## Challenges
One of the primary challenges was the **limited and fragmented documentation** available for the Panel library. Furthermore, finding consistent and reliable statistics for the economic metrics proved difficult, as various government-affiliated websites often provided differing figures. There were some issues with exherting control over specific alignments that I wanted so I was not able to control it as specifically as I would have liked. At the time, ChatGPT was not as well-versed in Panel, which meant I had to sift through extensive documentation independently. Although it was tedious, this process allowed me to gain more granular control over the dashboard, refining it to my preferences. 

Regarding the economic data, I encountered discrepancies across different sources, as the reliability of data varied depending on the publishing government agency. To mitigate these differences, I used a combination of informed judgment and averaging metrics from multiple credible sources, especially when the reliability appeared consistent across platforms.

## Outcome
One of the most gratifying aspects of building a dashboard—or anything with a UI component—is the ability to see tangible results from your work. Many hours were spent adjusting lines of code to perfect the dashboard, giving me a comprehensive understanding of both **Panel’s capabilities** and its **limitations**. Throughout this project, I also discovered another popular library called **Streamlit**, which offers more extensive resources and is widely adopted in the data community. I hope to explore Streamlit in future projects to expand my skills further.

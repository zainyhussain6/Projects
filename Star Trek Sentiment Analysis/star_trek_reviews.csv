"The first two seasons were awesome. Very good writing. Now with the third and especially the fourth season, the writing is horrible. Everything is overly dramatic. Pretty much every cast member annoys me now. I'm guessing the show got new writers after the second season. If that's the case, then they should have end the show there. Where did all the creativity go???",9 February 2022
Never have been so bored to death of hearing stupid speeches. Every 10 minutes there's a big speech about what there going in to and how important it is. Yeah yeah we got after 50th speech we didn't need another 100. Make a sci-fi program not political bull crap.,11 March 2022
"Ten years before Captain Kirk, this happened.....

I am not too big on two word reviews but I am tempted to make such a review here - this stinks!

Nearly everything about Star Trek: Discovery turns me off!

I view the original 60s series Star Trek as one of my top ten TV shows ever made and I have also enjoyed Deep Space Nine (1993-99) as well - but this!

Discovery might look like a million bucks but a recent web series called - Star Trek Continues - did a better job of going where no man has gone before than this rubbish!",27 December 2017
"Stopped watching. Cannot tolerate actors who whisper their lines. No wonder the main character has never been nominated for a Prime Time Emmy. Just makes the series intolerable to watch.

This TV series is just not not right and does not follow any resemblance to the originals series, and certainly not a very good prequel. The script lacks any plot or theme and the acting is unbelievably poor at it's best. Absolutely terrible. Cannot believe the overall rating.",29 January 2018
"No one hates Star Trek more than Star Trek fans. For every new series, we see a new generation of 'fans' bellowing and moaning about how this series will spell disaster for the franchise.

Lucky for me, I only started watching Star Trek in the last three years, catching up on something I never really saw before, so I get to come to it without decades of seething hatred for the smallest change.

Most of the complaints seem to be because it features an Asian-American woman as the captain and an African-American woman as the first officer, calling it a cliché, liberalism, or tokenism. I can't imagine a worse reason to dislike a series - because of the nationality or gender of the lead actors.

As for how I felt the first episode went? Well, it's a promising start. First, it looks gorgeous. This new generation of Star Trek is the realisation of fifty years of improved graphics, and while the shine and shimmer of the constant lens flaring is a little on the nose, it does look good.

Acting is a little wooden, but like a lot of things, my guess is that well see improvement as they settle into their roles a little more. The first episode contained a lot of exposition, of course, but they had to set the scene with the length of episode and amount of episodes they have at their disposal.

I look forward to seeing where this all goes, and unlike other 'fans,' I'll do so with an open mind and heart.",24 September 2017
"The higher ratings are garbage from either Hollywood paid marketing firms or an intentional effort to push some stupid social messaging.

Here is the bottom line, ST is a formula, it was built on a formula, its survived on a formula and it exists because of the formula. This garbage deviates so far from the formula that its like some film students 3rd year attempt to reimagine it.

As another reviewer mentions, Star Trek was always a message of hope, it was bright, positive, and had encouraging messaging, this has a dark theme, underlying negativity, dreadful background music or effects constantly playing to bring the vibe down very low.

What worked so well with the earlier versions of ST is they allowed the audience to use their own imagination, they told a story and allowed viewers to interpret.

This tries to define each and every nuance, this tries to reinvent and lay it all out.

StarTrek did an excellent job of intermixing races genders species, and it was a show from the 1960's, so far ahead of its time but sent the proper messaging.

This version force-feeds some obnoxiously unrealistic version that appears to be written to appeal to an audience that is not the typical StarTrek fanbase, and its not winning any new fans!

At the end of the day, the people who watch StarTrek appreciate how it was created and how it flowed, what this is, is not that, and its boring enough to not draw in any new viewers.

Im calling this another fail by CBS and by Hollyweird who continue to try and push their foolishness on everyone!",8 January 2022
"Ok, I get the hate for season 1. Didn't seem like Trek to me either. That being said season 2 seems to get things back on the Trek track for me. Capt Pike alone saves it for me, wrapping part of the story line in TOS story arc helps. Give it a try and don't judge it on season 1 alone. To all those complaining we don't see enough story about the bridge crew ask yourself just how much of TOS focused on the bridge crew. They were almost window dressing confined to repeating the same lines each week as the screen hog Shatner cut a ton of their lines, hailing frequencies open, shields up, aye Captain.....etc. No story's focused on them. Sure Next Generation gave us individual focused stories but not the original series. Anyways I like the direction season 2 is taking, try it. Sorry ignore all the above, the series takes a huge dump in season 3 and 4. Worst Trek ever.",5 March 2019
"The show started out techno-clever with interesting character interactions.

Now all we have is a bunch of needy characters episode after episode. Even the computer is needy. It is exhausting.

I give it a 6 because I still have hope, but the writing is being sucked into a black hole of neediness.",6 January 2022
"Apparently TV shows are made for younger kids these days. This show is so well produced that it's a shame it's become so boring, having gone way too far with teaching social correctness to young kids and sacrificing a good scifi story for a vision of the future with fleet crew members straight from daytime soap operas, too preoccupied with their emotional fragility to be competent. Ninjas vs Diabetics? In a sword fight? On a starship? Please. Stop it. I wish instead they'd capitalize more on the bold ideas, story elements and humor past shows have had... that appeal to all ages.",3 December 2021
"I just finished watching season 4 episode 1 and I don't know what to make of it. The show's script and dialogues feels like it's for an audience of 12 years old. The special effects are nicely done but the technology is borderline ""magic"" not believable.",19 November 2021
"This series is just wrong in so many different ways. It is less related to the Star Trek canon than JJ Abrams' turds were. This is raw Star-Trek-ploitation. Perhaps it could have been enjoyable if it were called something else and didn't try to awkwardly force itself into a mold it wasn't designed to fit into... If you like Star Trek, check out Star Trek Continues, New Voyages, or Lower Decks for better offerings in the Star Trek universe.",21 March 2022
"Where to begin...

For starters, it claims to be in line with the original series and its timeline yet nothing on display lines up with it or even visually resembles it. Instead it tries to replicate the look, feel, and energy of the JJ Abrams/Kelvin timeline movies(lens flares aplenty!) but it even fails at that.

The characters are mostly bland, stereotypical, and unlikeable.

It feels like everything that the original series tried to say has been thrown out the window to appeal to one-sided politics, Gene Roddenberry was trying to present hope and optimism for the future but here as far as Discovery is concerned the future is to be pretty but cold and uncaring.

As for the acting it ranges from good to okay mostly, very talented performers such as Jason Isaacs, Michelle Yeoh, Anson Mount, and Doug Jones all try their hardest but only in tiny glimpses are able to make the rough material work.

I would have to agree with other commenters that you are just better off with The Orville instead, far better Star Trek series.",13 October 2019
"Great until this point and then it turned into 13 Reasons Why in space?!? Was a good 7 or 8 out of 10 before this!

Extra characters to support minimum criteria to post about this somewhat not in keeping with the otherwise high quality first few series. Only reason I continue to watch is the fact that I am a big fan of the franchise in the first place. Struggling to find more to say before it will let me post this. I think I summed up my thoughts succinctly in my first sentence or two but they want more before I can express said opinion.",12 May 2022
"I'm sort of enjoying this in parts, but why oh why is the main character, Michael Burnham, bursting into tears or looking tearful in nearly every one of her scenes? Who on earth would write a Commander who is supposed to have had a Vulcan upbringing but is both emotionally unstable and incapable of making the kind of flash, life and death decisions required of command? The whole of everything can be at stake and yet she stands around crying about one thing ot another, agonising with someone while people around her are suffering and dying and the world is coming to an end yet again and you are thinking for God's sake get on with it and stop blubbering. The amount of emotion had me in tears, not of empathy but boredom. The amount of slow moving, soul-searching scenes is a drag on what could otherwise be a good show. The gratuitous violence is too much and unnecessary. I have commented previously in another place about the current annoyingly cynical use of gay or lesbian relationships in every series and film these days. The right to a relationship of your choice and way of life is an accepted thing now, so why is there a pushy political agenda which I think is patronising to gay people in that the producers assume that gay people won't watch anything without a gay person in it? Sci-fi fans are sci-fi fans no matter who they are, and it is partitioning gay people rather than treating them as normal viewers like the rest od us. I also found some action very confusing. The special effects are great, though. We're into Series 3 so I don't expect the crying to lessen. I tend to go and make tea now in the blubbery moments, but one can only drink so much tea in an hour or so.",3 July 2022
"Having just watched the first two episodes, I want to chime in on behalf of those people who have seen every episode of every series, but who are not ""purists"" about Star Trek. Frankly, these first episode were much better than my admittedly low expectations. On the positive side, there are at least three characters that are fleshed out, given backstories, and show some development. There is a story arc, one that reminds me of the one with the Cardassians in DS9. Finally, and I don't know how to say this any better, but there is a welcome dearth of stupid bangles -- no holosuites, no tribbles, no Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis romance. On the negative side, there is a lot more action than discovery, and while in many people's eyes that made ""First Contact"" a winning entry in the series, there is something that fails about that approach when one is forced to watch commercials every seven minutes. This lack of puzzles is echoed by a crew member who says something like ""we were supposed to be on a journey of exploration not a war,"" which was my sentiment throughout the JJ movies, and so I hope there is more ""discovery"" in the rest of the series.

Two things make me optimistic going forward. First, the teaser for coming episodes indicates we are getting to the ""journey of exploration"" starting in episode 3. Also, Sonequa Martin-Green is really rather good, as is Doug Jones, and they appear to both be in the continuing arc along with Jason Isaacs. I'm old enough to remember how lame the first episodes of DS9 seemed to be -- a lot of stuff about baseballs -- and yet it is the series of which I am most fond. It is hard to start a series like this, but the foundation that is laid here could sustain. But ""Discovery"" got quite a bit more right in terms of creating a unique feel within a familiar context than I expected based on the ever-changing group of people involved in creating it.",25 September 2017
"So far season 2 has been the best of the series. While season 4 has an interesting story arc, I am seeing far too much time spent on characters having heart to heart discussions. This is Star Trek, not group therapy. It seems no crisis is too dire or time critical that time can't be taken for inappropriate (in the moment) conversation. Billions of lives are at stake but let's pause for several minutes to tug at the old heart strings, or perhaps just to pad the show out to a full episode.",14 March 2022
"Show went from being OK at best for the first season, to pretty bad in the second, to cringe in the third and has now achieved ""unwatchable"" status. In fact I just stopped watching s04e02 mid episode during another interminable self endulging motivational speech.

Cringe...",27 November 2021
"Judging from the first episodes: I expected much worse, and i was blown away. And I understand that many Trek fans will not be able to overcome the design changes. This series is Darker, the Klingons resemble the Prometheus Engineers, the narrative does not appear to be mainly episodic; and many principles of the federation will fall ethically into shades of gray. However, if we take our expectations and preconceived notions out of the equation, and accept this series for what it is. Arguably, it is the most impressive Space Opera series of the last few years. Visually surpassing series as The Expanse or Stargate Universe. Narratively, the War premise works flawlessly as a grand opening, and will serve as a solid foundation for the rest of the series. The characters are convincing, the strong personality of the protagonist is not forced. And the chemistry between peers is pleasant. I really enjoyed this bold new approach to this franchise. If I preferred to see something more familiar, like a sequel within the TNG era? Yes, no doubt. But despite of this, this version is a high quality production on so many levels. And I'll wait religiously for the next episodes.",25 September 2017
"I watched the first three seasons and kinda liked the show at first. But as the episodes went on, the constant whispering by the actors just began to annoy me. Are they afraid someone will hear their 💩 acting? Is there someone sleeping on the set they are trying not to wake? Does the script call out (whispers) before every freakin line? I don't know, but it seems to be an attempt at dramatization that I just can't take anymore.

So I started watching season 4, and sure enough, it's still whisper mode for Sonequa. Speak your freakin lines woman!",9 December 2021
"WTF is going on with everyone crying all the time?

Everyone is an emotional wreck in this show. These people should have never made it into Starfleet. There ain't no crying in Starfleet!

More than half of every episode is dedicated to people crying and explaining their feelings. They do it before and after every event that takes place and then the do it some more just so you know how the feel. Stop crying and talking already and do action. Pew! Pew!

The main girl is the worst of them all. She whispers and cries in every episode and she is suppose to be the damn captain. Nobody wants a crying captain.

She cries more than Carrie Mathison of Homeland and i didn't think that was possible. Space!",11 December 2021
"The first season was ok and had a promising start but it rapidly decayed into a sappy soap opera set in the Star Trek universe. The characters in the show and the plot have all the potential needed but the continuing agony of ongoing psychology sessions (they call them episodes) is making me reconsider my future and I'll need counselling, long into the future, for having watched this. Writing this is part of my exposure therapy after season 4 where my brain was set to stun. But seriously, so disappointed that the focus was on giving out life lessons and not writing good Star Trek stories. I get it that you can have positive messages in shows, not a bad thing, but this is just way too much, at the expense of a potentially good series.

In my personal unscientific rating scale 4=Forced myself to watch to the end but didn't really enjoy and won't watch it again.",13 December 2022
"So here we are with another series of Star Trek with lots of cheesy lines and bad acting.... No wonder my partner does not want to watch it!

...but wait I am 3 episodes in and the usual bad acting and, cheap jokes have yet to make an appearance.

The new ''ST:D'' <(yea someone was having a laugh there weren't they?)> appears on our screen as a mature watch, credible actors, engaging storyline and great special effects/cgi.

It reminds me of what batman begins attempted to do with that series, and take it down a darker path and aim for a more mature audience.

Every episode so far feels like it belongs in the cinema and that is highly commendable. I have been watching the other new TV series Orville - it has a star trek feel but is certainly aimed at the comedy market so watching the two in a week is awesome as you get the whole sci fi feeling....

I know the trekkie purists will be angry at another retread at a prequel... and I am no hardcore trekkie. But change is good... It follows on from the recent films the first of which attempted to change the trekkie world meaning anything from that point can change!

ST:D (haha) is for me the best thing to happen in recent years, so other than a trip to the doctors I am awarding it a 10/10!!",2 October 2017
"As a huge Star Trek fan for years who has watched every Star Trek episode of the 28 seasons of TV and all the hits and misses at the movies, I was pretty excited to hear of Star Trek: Discovery premiere night and gathered my extended family - some trekkies and some oblivious to the universe - to watch together this Sunday.

Star Trek Deep Space Nine premiere got me hooked on Star Trek and I could not expect the same stirring sense of awe, universe creation and strong characterization. However, having followed the new series development and push back from May launch date and seen some impressive trailers, I wished for the best to revive a TV icon that had been dormant since Enterprise got cancelled and aired last in May 2005.

So just fresh of this 'fascinating' experience here are the GOOD, the BAD, (and the BADASS!) after the first two episodes:

The BADASS is Sonequa Martin-Green and her rebellious Michael Burnham character. She acts well, has strong dialogue and character development, especially in the second episode with the Sarek and Vulcan arc. She also has some action, self-reflection and intellect to showcase.

The GOOD are the stunning special effects and Starfleet crew. From the new race to mysterious robot, but mostly the interactions from the captain (Philippa Georgiou), commander Burnham and chef science officer (Saru) are spot on. Great tension, friendship, work ethics, chemistry and captivating acting. A shame we may not see too much of Michelle Yeoh in the future. I have faith for similar good character development for the seldom seen or heard rest of the core crew. I think creators and writers got it right so far for the Federation side which should be the focus.

The BAD is all the underused Klingon subplot where the series not only change the prosthetic and physical appearance of a well known documented and liked alien race in the canon universe, but also some of its culture and history. To portray the Klingons as only war-like and hungry for battle is not incorrect but is falling into the trap of creating an easy villain. Klingons are liked because they have a culture that also include good-natured laughs, drinks, food and friendship. They have time honoured traditions but can also break them, they think, feel and try not to fear for honour and bravery. They have reasons, reflexes and often a cause. They have memorable characters like Worf, Martok, Torres, Gowron, Kahless, Kurn, Kang, Chang and the Duras sisters to name a few. They have also a lot of language and culture already well developed so to see a new way they treat their dead in Discovery for instance feels unnecessary and not complementary to Sto'Vo'Kor (their Heaven or Valhalla) tradition and thinking.

BOTTOM LINE: every scene with Klingons and their dialogue so far seem useless and uninteresting compared to previous Klingon depth of culture or possible new avenues for this known race or even new made up race. This is poor and reflects limited reflection and petty fear fostering rather than enriching the palette of a wide and wide-reaching tapestry. Thus T'Kuvma, the Klingon new Messiah, is the weakest character as of now and all this Kahless reborn and ritualistic machination is not working to better the understanding of this beloved race.

As for the show it seems to have the potential to finish the 15- episode first season with strong story arcs, well-developed characters and situations. It will surely find some personal and philosophical aspects to explore as well as new ways of life and thinking like most good Star Trek did. My only current hope is this Klingon oversight is temporary and will balance itself out in an otherwise top sci-fi addition to the impressive Star Trek universe. I will give this my full attention as we await the fate of some interesting characters and can't wait to DISCOVER more.",24 September 2017
"At first I thought that this was a bad show, but when I watched it again after almost 4 months, it turned out it is not that bad, now I'm on ep 14. And I have to say, I really like it, I don't even know, what it is about it, that I disliked so much, polrobably that it is so different from previous startreks, but now that I started again, I like it a lot, so, for those who had the same opinion about this show as me, try watching it again. It might turn out, that it's actually pretty good.",3 January 2019
"Seasons 1 and 2 of Discovery has everything a good Trek show offered in the past: space exploration, intergalactic conflict, alternate universes, complex science, humor, diversity and drama. All of these aspects are really well balanced.

Seasons 3 and 4, on the other hand, gave much more emphasis on the drama aspect. It becomes overwhelming, tiresome, unbearable. The few elements of old Trek shows are still there, but always deep in the background. I also think the diversity elements were overused to the point of becoming caricature. Star Trek was always about diversity, but what happens in seasons 3 and 4 of Diversity are almost a mockery.",6 May 2022
"I really enjoyed the 1st two episodes of the new Trek, it was action packed and full of new characters. I did read many reviews and am not totally surprised at the bad reviews as many people felt that way about the other shows ... most notably, the Original Star Trek. It appears the first two episodes are a pilot to a much different season coming up which will be on a new ship, The Discovery. That seems to be where this new crew will boldly go where fans are expecting. It's new Star Trek, and as a 40 year fan I look forward to seeing the whole season and will judge more based on a season and not just what ""I"" expect things to be like or want. As for the bad reviews, they should possibly perform an internal audit of their own and judge accordingly. In my view the first 2 episodes get a 10 star rating as I wanted to see more.",28 September 2017
"The biggest issue I have with the show is that the main character seems very unfit for a leading position. She is doing rash acts with bad consequences. Also even though set before the classic series, the technology has to be better than in that series. But that seems to be the typical power creep with long lasting SF series of series.

I am not inclined to complaint about the long lasting story arc that didn't exist in the classic series. There have been other precedences.",12 January 2022
"So Im reading a lot of reviews of how unlike Start Trek this is... well.. if you want to see the last several decades of Star Trek we been getting again....go watch the last several decades again. For those who are saying Gene Roddenberry has been betrayed...news flash...the mans been dead for over 25 years now. If Star Trek is supposed to stay the same for ever, why bother making any more Star Trek movies or TV series?? Hey, I love the original series and Star Trek Generations and many of the Star Trek movies, but I don't expect it to stay the same for ever and ever. Are we expecting Batman movies not to change or evolve?

This is a new Star Trek, for a new audience and a new generation, if you are a purist, this might not be for you if you want the last several decades regurgitated. So far we're only 2 episodes in and I like where its going. It's definitely darker in terms of the Star Trek franchise, the same can be said if you compare Adam West as Batman on TV to Christian Bale going up against Heath Ledger's Joker.

This Star Trek looks like it has an intensity none of the other Star Treks could pull off, it's gritty and harsh and war is starting. Its not supposed to be campy and humorous, and I really don't think a lot of purist and Trekkies will be able to handle whats to come and might want to tune into the Orvile to get their regurgitated Star Trek fix.

It's a bit early to see a lot of character development with Star Trek Discovery, but I'm looking forward to see whats in store.",28 September 2017

"I've been with this 'show' for maybe far too long - but depressingly I have decided that it is not what it should be.

"We all heard about issues plaguing the making of this series, and the scream from Star Trek purists following the trailers.

As someone myself, who's watched every episode of Star Trek, I can solemnly say without hesitation that this series has established relevance in the modern era of TV - without having to denigrate women.

Good points:

-Klingon's are more intimidating than any prior TV series. They also speak in their own language.

-The directing, editing and engagements are quite slick. -It's absent of any cringe prior Star Trek's had.

-The story (despite being a equal), is engaging and delivered in a superb way.

Bad points:

-Early on, they used CGI quite liberally, however



-The captain's accent may come across as if she's wooden and emotionless. -If you don't like reading subtitles, the presence of Klingon's may ruin the immersiveness.

-It's too early to call, I enjoyed the first episode a lot more than I thought. They exceeded my expectations regarding production value, directing and continual story.

What purists/fanboys won't like:

-It's a prequel, we all know how Star Trek Enterprise went down...

-Technology is more slick and beyond that of the original series, considering it's set 10 years earlier. However while they try to keep as many sounds and base designs - They have a point. But you've got to modernize it some way. Technology from the 60's doesn't exactly look futuristic.

-Redesigning of the Klingon's. This has been partially explained in DS9 and we've been told they have a good reason for this. Personally, they look more intimidating, Klingon's in TNG look nothing like the original, - so this is evolutionary.

-No characters thus far - from the other series. In the past, each series has showed someone from another series. -Some slight alterations of history, they've changed some small things in order to fit their new story.

Overall, it's certainly worth watching. There's no nudity or lewd behavior which often plagues our shows these days. The two leads are women, and they're respected like everyone else. There's no money or alcohol. Just how things are meant to be portrayed in the series.",25 September 2017
"I waited till I saw the fourth episode of Star Trek: Discovery to write a review for I didn't want to be too early to pass judgement. And, my opinion has not changed much since the first ten minutes of the series. The show has many problems. The first problem appears to be the Klingons who are re-imagined, tougher and annoying looking creatures and they -at least in my case- cause a distraction from the subject matter for they shouldn't look like that. Unless the series ends with the incident that changes them temporarily into Russian-steppe-folk like they looked in the Original Series and their genetic reformation turned them into the Klingons of sequel series, then, we have a problem there. Secondly, the ships Discovery and Shenzhou don't look like anything Cpt. Archer or later Cpt. Kirk used but there were sketches, models, etc. in several ST source material that may justify the shape of the ships. Thirdly, the aims of Discovery doesn't seem too Star-Trek-ky; but, if the fan theory is right and the NCC-1031 is actually the beginnings of Section 31, then, it is understandable. Fourthly, there are small details that might annoy the truer fans than I am: each ship should have a unique emblem and theirs is the same in all ships we have seen, Klingons again, Walker-class ships seem to be too advanced compared to Enterprise ships of both TOS and ST: Enterprise.

However, the biggest problem is in the characters: one doesn't want to be involved with them, one doesn't appreciate them, one doesn't establish empathy with them. Lieutenant Michael Burnham is aloof, problematic, and yet turns into a defendant of all Star Trek values -and, she's the adopted sister of the greatest legend of them all, Spock! She doesn't make me learn how her story develops. Michelle Yeoh's Captain Georgoiou is too nice to be three- dimensional and maybe it is good that she didn't last that much. The only interesting character is the captain of the Discovery, that is Jason Isaacs' Captain Gabriel Lorca. However, Lorca is just a vengeful, bitter character just like Ahab of Moby Dick and we had that with Picard, thank you very much. Also, I am not sure there are too many who wants to know how the Klingon war-birds had cloaking technology and Starfleet didn't have. In short, the series, despite using some new tech CGI and having great set design, is not very brilliant. The effort of explaining an ""incident"" referred to in series ""set chronologically later"" is a valiant effort but the cast, writing, and characterizations are not very good. Unless they do something really radical at the remaining 2/3 of the series, it won't be a great success story, I am afraid. Besides, knowing that Seth MacFarlane's comedic take on the Starfleet universe, The Orville does everything by the book despite not being canonical Star Trek, makes it even worse for the Discovery.",15 October 2017
"I'm unsure what is wrong with some people??

This show is a great standalone, the characters are strong, the acting superb, I admit the mirrored universe dragged a bit but it was still enjoyable.

Those comparing to next gen etc are a little confusing to me, this is set before that period and paves the way for what we know about Kirk, Spock et al, but gives more character background to them, before sneaking off on its own to forge a separate path.

Reviews can be useful, but I think they should be taken with a pinch of salt and decide for yourselves.

Especially those who are so quick to condemn the commitment, hard work, creativity and vision of those with such love for their craft

They share their creations with the world to transport us from the mundane to the imaginable. I think it's somewhat brutal, insensitive, unnecessary and vicious of some people to be so attacking.

Take a moment to consider the fact that those leaving such scathing reviews will never accomplish the actions and achievements of the people they are putting down. Maybe that's the problem? They know it.

Decide for yourself.

As for the show... I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT, I thought that the first episode of S3 was brilliant, not overdone, I feel it's setting up nicely for the season without giving too much away.

Can't wait till next week.",16 October 2020
After finishing season 3 I've decided I won't be watching anymore. This show has a huge budget that is directly reflected in the production design. It looks stunning but the writing is atrocious. Each season is marked by a decline in the story and season 3 was the last straw. Whats the point of putting so much money into your budget if the writing sucks? It's become a slog to get through and the show no longer holds my attention.,18 January 2021

"I admit that I was initially pulled in by the artistry and Klingon infighting drama, but I lost interest after the first season. The characters are uninteresting, the dialogue is tedious when it isn't lacking, and the plot is slow and uninspired. I started with high hopes, then became disappointed that the show wasn't taking me anywhere.

Like other things called ""STD"", getting invested in this show may fill you with regret.",22 March 2022
"By far and away the stupidest sci fi show I have ever encountered is Star Tripe Discovery.

Its low IQ codswallop with dim witted plot turns with idiotic nonsense about parasitic ice, cats with what appears to be hypothyroidism and inexplicable exploding di-lithium called 'the burn"". Backed up by a cast of characters so uninteresting, shallow and generally boring, they make tax returns exciting.

Really it seems no ones trying here so why should anyone bother watching? Looking forward to the next season of The Orville. In my opinion the truest successor to the spirit of the 60's and 90's Star Trek series.

2/10 for decent production values but not a lot else.",29 October 2020
"The wokeness and alphabet soup overacting has arrived to the Super Universe that was Star Trek... and made it worse... 7/10 to me means ""watchable but only if there is really nothing else you could be doing..."" Star Trek was already about respect and acceptance of differences... the added virtue signalling just is ridiculous.",18 March 2022
The cgi effects are great and the finish is slick. The story has potential and there are a few interesting characters going through interesting psychological situations. However the excessive emoting and needles crying coupled with the whispered talking about feelings is sooooooo boring. If i had a cent for every time Michael Burnam cried i would be a millionaire by now. This should be called Star Trek Soap. I watched the show because I'ma great Star Trek fan however it was painful and i fast-forwarded most of unnecessary touchy-feely scenes due to their being so superficial. Fire the person who wrote these scenes in.,20 March 2022
"I'm halfway through season 4 and wow... just wow. It feels like I'm watching a group therapy session of whiny, privileged teenagers who are mostly just bored and happen to be in space for some reason. These supposed to be high ranking, trained officers, but none of them actually behaves like one. Everybody is always on the verge of an emotional breakdown and even in the middle of an actual crisis, all they seem to care about is to talk about their feelings. Now even the ship's computer is having emotional issues. Like what???

What is the point of this? Why are they even there? Who the hell would assigns these people to man a ship and send them on missions? They can't even cope with basic human day-to-day issues, let alone military or diplomatic conflicts!",29 January 2022

Who are these writers, directors, and actors?! Liberal madness!",3 January 2021
Star Trek has a huge fan base around the world built over many decades by the vision and good intentions of Gene Roddenberry and others. However corporate greed and utter contempt for fans by Paramount execs and the recent decision to limit the new discovery season 4 to US only whilst deliberately misleading fans into believing it was also going to be launched internationally is yet further proof. If you're going to launch a streaming service you let the fans know well in advance and make sure you have your own service ready to roll in the majority of markets around the world. Complete incompetence at paramount. Vote with your wallets and do not sign up for Paramount+.,19 November 2021
"All you had to do, is use the same actors as the movies, or just good actors. Please start making better episodes and have better writing because this is ruining my love for my favourite franchise. Acting is horrible, story is boring, just not what i was expecting. Please get to the Deep space nine standard, it was the best",12 October 2017
"The only people who seem not to like this new Star Trek are people who feel they have to compare it to previous incarnations. Sure there's no Shatner or Nimoy, no Bones or Sulu or Scotty but there also are no 50 year old cheesy special effects, no thin plot lines and no ill fitting costumes. While I do like the old Star Trek, I doubt if I - or anyone else - would like a remake of the original series with different actors.

I very much enjoyed this for what it is - an pretty darn good Sci-fi show. Who cares if the technology does not fit the Star Trek ""timeline""? Or if the Klingons look different? If that bothers you, just go watch the original 79 Star Trek episodes over and over again.

People, get over it! It's time to go where no man has gone before and stop living in the past.",25 September 2017

"I just don't understand why people are hating this so much. Will be watching the season 2 final next week and I still really like this show. I can't for the life of me see why people are so disappointed in this show. I look at it as something different and stopped comparing it to the original star trek. I think it is well acted and the story is not that bad. I kind of like the one story in stead of a different stories each week. I have to admit that the second season has been a little messy but still has been was not all that bad. Yes the story circles around Micheal Burnam too much but still it is good. Giving this series a one star is just ridiculous. The visuals alone merit more that a one star. I am a child of the 60's and was there in front of the television when the original pilot aired and then again when they retooled it and put Captian Kirk in charge. I know all dialog to most episodes so, yes I know how the original was done. I am just about like that with TNG. With this one I go into it to be entertained and not nit pick this series to death. I am the same way with the new movies. I love my star trek and always will but I like this one also just feel like it is something all together different. The only thing that bothered me about this series is it takes place 10 years before Kirk's Enterprise but still has superior technology that thing right there makes me laugh. I try to over look that fact but still makes me shake my head at times. All in all this a fairly good series and deserves way more then one star.",12 April 2019
"Like a lot of other viewers I've been a lifelong fan of the Star Trek franchise... And I've religiously watched every movie and series... Even the ones that weren't that good. Unfortunately, Discovery is a horribly written series and, in my opinion, the worst one produced yet.

First the good... The actors do a good job portraying the characters as they were written. The special effects are top notch and it's visually stunning. I love seeing the new species included in the Star Trek universe, and as a general rule of thumb, I enjoy how they're portrayed. Unfortunately, this is about the only good thing I can say about the show.

Now the bad... My biggest complaint with the show is it's not about the ship and the crew. As it's been on every other version of Star Trek. This show is quite literally about the character Michael Burnham and how everyone in it revolves around her. Now to be clear, my objection to this character has nothing to do with Sonequa Martin-Green. She's a fine dramatic actresses and I enjoyed her character on The Walking Dead. She's simply playing the part as it's written.

It's simply EVERY crisis on the show has Michael Burnham at the center of it, in one way or another. The writers seemed have made a conscious decision to make her the single most important character in the Star Trek universe. The fate of the entire universe has hung by a thread because of her. She'll regularly unilaterally deciding the direction and actions of the ship, and usurping the Captain's authority. There will be a crisis, and she'll simply get some intuitive feeling about it, and suddenly the Discovery is off following what she's said. Which is wrong enough times, someone should tell her to shut up when she starts talking.

And of course, there's the countless times she's used some moral superiority to decide she had the authority to break the chain of command, or go on an unauthorized mission only she knows about. Her character is about as self indigent as they come, and seems to lack any situational awareness. The character Michael Burnham regularly comes up with some emotional rational (Really weird for someone that grew up on Vulcan being trained in logic) to justify going rogue. Next thing you now, she's off creating a crisis the crew of Discovery must save her for. As someone the claims to value the institution of Star Fleet, her self obsession with her own idea of right and wrong is baffling. Even Spock called her ""self important"" once. Which fits to a T.

Next the Michael Burnham character has some weird balance of absolute certainty and insecurity at the same time. To be honest, it's annoying. Pretty much every crisis has the same formula. At the start of a crisis, she's dictating what the entire crew of Discovery should be doing. Next she's question what the crew is doing and why. And once the crisis has been resolved she gives some long winded speech.

Which brings me to something else that annoys me. The character Michael Burnham is CONSTANTLY giving these weird motivational speeches. For some reason, when she starts talking, everyone shuts up and listens to her. Including the Captain. A large group of the crew will be together in some situation, and she'll be the only one giving some long winded speech. Michael Burnham is always talking, and talking, and talking and giving speech after speech to everyone else.

This brings me to my next complaint. Pretty much every character is good for emotionally puking at least once per episode. Literally, every episode contains a speech from some character (Usually Michael Burnham) about ""family"", love, loss, acceptance, respect, cooperation, etc. They do this at the weirdest moments in the show too. On more than one occasion, the crew have been furiously working to resolve some life threatening crisis to the ship, and suddenly every character will stop doing what they were doing, to validate their or someone else's feelings. It's so predictable I can tell when someone's going to launch into a uselessly emotionally draining speech. Between the speeches and emotional puking... That's roughly 1/3 of every episode.

I could go on, but my last complaint is about the absolute lack of humor or jocularity. In pretty much every other version of Star Trek to be produced, the writers would find a way to work a little humor into their shows. Which always made past Star Trek shows fun. I understand there's a time & place for humor in a show, but Discovery is almost completely devoid of humor. This version of Star Trek is flat out depressing with how serious all the character's are.

Now how this show has a 7.1 IMDB rating is beyond me... It's horribly written. Other than the occasional mention of the Federation, I can't image any Star Trek fan recognizing Discovery as one that belongs in the Star Trek universe.",17 March 2022
"OUR MISSION: TO EXPLORE THE NEW AND SEEK OUT STRANGE NEW SHOWS AND NEW IMPRESSIONS, TO BOLDLY GO AND SEE THIS WITH AN OPEN MIND AS ONLY A FEW HAS GONE BEFORE :)

I read reviews here before I saw the first two episodes and started watching with a bad feeling, but wow! completely surprised - well done I must say.

Besides a female leading role (its kinda a cliché now...not needed anymore - we get it, we are equal :) ), then the main-character of Michael Burnham does a really good job. So far I like the stories including hers and looking forward to learning more.

In terms of relationship to the old star trek stories, then to be honest I don't care. I think Enterprise with J. Archer failed because it tried to much to fit into the old concept instead of using whatever CGI and new explorations in stories like we have access to today. And I watched them all - so a fan like all other here, but do not need the old to make the new good. It works for itself very well!

I get a feeling of Batman The Dark Knight when watching this - mood, CGI, actors - are all well put together.

I have now watched 2½ episode and cannot get enough. I just paused the 3. episode to write this, because I really truly cannot understand how people can write such bad reviews just because it doesn't fit into the old (and a bit now dull settings of the older series). Let me put it this way:

This rocks - so shut it you old grumpy Star Trek fans :) And I'm 38 so old as well - I just embrace this - well done and good job.",2 October 2017
"Watched first episode on CBS, for free, i liked it. The opening scene was cool and visually it was well done. Looks like they put money and effort into production. As for the acting and writing that will take sometime to get a feel for. I hope to see more humor and witty comebacks. Lets hope we see the chemistry between characters like 7of9 and Doc or Picard and Data. Time will tell and it will cost you to watch.",24 September 2017
I've been a lifelong fan of Star Trek and this is putrid trash. I would give it a negative warp 10 rating if that was possible. They need to fire all the current writers and producers.,6 October 2021
"Unless you have (Firsthand) experienced Writers all you get is secondhand interpretations.

Gene Roddenberry was a U.S. Army Air Corp Officer, Bombardier Navigator North Africa (Libya, Tunisia) during World War 2. He told me during a conversation, after one of his Star Trek Bloopers Presentations, as to where he started to get his Ideas for Star Trek.

You MUST have Star Trek Writers, that had actually Served the U.S. Military as Officers to have Firsthand Experience to KNOW what to Write so that the Actors can accurately portray Star Fleet Officers, Warrant Officers ""Mister"", Non Commissioned Officers, Enlisted.

From My Experience U.S. Navy Officer, how things about a Star Fleet Vessel work, just like on a current U.S. Navy Ship (especially a Nuclear Aircraft Carrier) or Submarine. U.S. Air Force Officer, Flight and Technology, 3 dimensional Combat. U.S. Marine Corps Officer, Security, Star Trek Away Teams. U.S. Army Special Forces Officer, Humanitarian Assistance Missions, Foreign Internal Defense, Direct Action Missions, as not everything is about breaking destroying and killing, same as like the Star Trek Federation. Ground Combat sequences of Star Trek. NASA Astronaut Training as a U.S. Military Officer, multi dimensional Space Combat. up down, left right, forward backward. Power and Life Support adds the Element of Time.

"FIRST EPISODE. The Klingons remind me of an antiseptic version of Tan Mom on the Howard Stern show. Depressed, almost suicidal creatures wearing a dark, shiny, greasy mask. Donald Trump's hair has more personality. You guys REALLY messed up on that one. I mean bad. Almost unwatchable it's so bad.

The crew, well, I think we covered the Asian, African American, Muslim and woman. Waiting for the trans and gay next. Not that there's anything wrong with any of it. On the contrary. But it's so obvious on this show, they might as well be wearing I'm-here-to-fill-a gender\race-quota sign.

The acting followed a path of cardboard. 5,4,3,2,1 MY LINE! Next. 5,4,3,2,1 MY LINE! Next...... In all fairness, I know it takes a bit to get your footing. Sometimes an entire season. Time will tell.

The scenery in some places was really beautiful but cannot make up for everything else that was wrong with this show.

All in all, I'm on the fence leaning toward bailing. If for no other reason, the Klingons. Just can't get past it.

SECOND EPISODE. It was worse than the first. Characters are not likable or interesting. The bridge is dark and lifeless.

I dwelled on the Klingons after the first episode but just can't get past how bad they are. Like some kind of solid lifeless cartoons. Not Klingons for sure. Maybe they should be called anti-Klingons (Data anti-time reference :))

Is Lt. Saru an old gay alien?

For the first time in Star Trek history, I will not be watching a 3rd, or 4th or another episode.

If you want a ST fix, take a watch of The Orville. Just watched the first episode last night. They do take some Guardians of the Galaxy liberties but it's fun and MUCH more like ST then this - I don't know what to call Discovery other than something I hope to forget very soon.

CBS - If you have any mercy, you will shoot this injured horse, this abomination and put it out of our misery.",25 September 2017
"Discovery's formula is much more like the new line of Star Trek movies than any of the TV series. It wants to grab you with action and spectacle, taking little time to develop characters in realistic scenes and conversations. Some people will like that, but, as with other scifi TV of late, I feel a little overwhelmed with a lot of over the top CGI. It makes you wonder if the actors are truly just on a big green screen stage, with everything except for the chairs they're sitting in being painted in later.

Fortunately the acting's pretty good, and lead character Sonequa Martin- Green comes from out of nowhere to dominate the cast. I was very impressed with her, and you need to be, because side characters seem mostly to get ignored through the first two episodes. They serve as foils or mentors for Commander Burnham. That's something I miss. Discovery feels too rushed to get to know anyone. There will be no Lower Decks card games or evolving friendships or slow burning romances here. There may be only one season and only 15 episodes, so they move quickly into bad guys and combat. We won't be pondering the meaning of life here, or even the value of restraint in wartime. He who hesitates is gonna get whacked.

The Klingons, on the other hand, talk slowly and act predictably in scenery so busy it's difficult to make out what we're supposed to appreciate, as if everything is taking place in an acid flashback. Poor choices all around.

Sadly, to pull in more casual viewers who want a quick action fix, the old faithful fans are taken for granted. It's good to see Star Trek alive and well, but its personality has become a cold ghost of its once genial, welcoming warmth. We must be trapped in combat for the duration.",25 September 2017
"I consider myself a simple minded person. We have now had 3 movies and 2 TV shows since the end of what I call the modern Star Trek era (after ST: Nemesis and after ST: Voyager).

Am I the only one who would like to see a USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-F)?

"This show will ruin your Trek experience, I watched it when it was released. Unfortunately I didn't listen to my reactions and I suffered through the season, ending up hating the experience. It was so damaging that I didn't want to watch anything from Star Trek for a long time.

Now when 4 season are released I tried it again because I am watching whole Star Trek in chronological order and this show was up before TOS. Same reactions as the first time, this time I was able to stop at episode 5 from season 1 and I decided to skip all new content. I am going straight to TOS which I find 100 times better.

To be honest a lot of new movies and TV shows that are coming out in the last few years not related in any way to Star Trek suffer from the same disease. I won't speculate what that is I just know that there is something missing.

Funny thing is that there are so many shows from the past that are so good, and there are so many of them that I don't need to watch anything new until I die. After I watch everything from Star Trek including the movies I am going through same chronological viewing order but this time in Stargate universe. Then after that I am going to watch probably X-Files, then I will move to Supernatural and so on.

You have been warned, proceed watching this show at your own risk ;)",6 July 2023

"I really hope this series ends with the Doctor from Voyager, saying computer end program as he walks out smugly from the holo deck. I hated this ending for Enterprise, but for Discovery it would make alot of sense.

Its almost every episode someone is crying or having an emotional breakdown because their hamster is dying. Then they all have to hold hands and talk about their feelings. Even the ships computer needs a pet talk.

I miss old trek where they would just reverse the polarity or invert the neutreno flow and then have a laugh playing poker at the end, even though a red shirt was flushed out the air lock 10 min earlier.

I personally like it...a lot.

Star Trek needs a shot in the arm and a serious shake up otherwise all we'll end up with is another series exactly the same as everything that has come before. Every ep looks like a movie, the acting is solid (in particular Jason Isaacs) and the writing is quality too.

I think a lot of the hardcore fans (i would consider myself one) just wanted Picard 2.0. It's time to move on guys.",2 October 2017
"Update: I'm partway through Season 4 and dropped my rating back to 6. Fortunately the toning down of all the hyper-OTT-emotion has continued and it's not quite as bad as Seasons 1 and 2.

The good - there is action, characters, plot as there should be.

The bad - all the pop psychology, which is extremely tiresome and belongs in a soap opera not action scifi. If I had to put up with all that nonsense wailing and moaning and ""finding myself"" every day at work or at home, I'd change jobs and move out of home. Heck, even the computer is grappling with its emotions.

Give us a break. This is star trek. All this tear-jerking and soul-searching and pained faces detracts from the show and is annoying to watch. If the producers/directors/writers/actors need a shrink, please do it off screen, don't force it on your audience.

-------------

After watching Season 3 I've upped the rating to 8. This latest season was much better than the first two seasons. More like what Star Trek should be. Michael's over the top dialogue was tamed, thank goodness, and I liked the setting and opportunities it gives for future episodes. I hope there's a season 4 to carry on the Star Trek journey some more.

--------------

This was it after the first two seasons: I really want to like Star Trek Discovery.

There are some promising characters, but they aren't shown off they way they could be. There are far too many emotional scenes and almost no discovery. It's all about fighting, overacting, emotional tension, and no ""trekky"" feeling to it at all.

After episodes in other Star Trek series I can sit back and say, I feel good, I really enjoyed that episode. They had some serious bits but they were mostly fun and wonder. This show doesn't leave me with that feeling. I miss it. Instead I feel as if I've been put through the mill, pointlessly, with no reward.

It's a real shame. There are all the ingredients but they are mixed together in a way that isn't what Star Trek should or could be. There is so much potential, wasted.

"This was one of the most BOTCHED and Ridiculous Portrayal's of Star Fleet and Star Trek EVER. When I watched ""Ok A new Star Trek Show"" but after seeing the way that Star Fleet is portrayed and the Ridiculous lack of Military bearing and Science I could barely stomach it.

The ""Captain"" is a Joke and has no business being in the Center Chair. Her First Officer is LEAGUES More Qualify to be Captain than she is.

"I was sceptical before, but: It has the touch of Star Trek 2009, Star Trek: Enterprise 2001 and and a bit Star Trek 1966. And even my favourite is TNG, and its much darker spirit, it is still Star Trek. Despite the title, it probably won't have the ""discovery"" and research character in the way the other ST series have. (At least in the first season) It's going to be a DS9- Dominion-War / Voyager / conflict / survival thing. I think it will be interesting to see what happens when this young Utopia and Starfleet is under siege.",2 October 2017
"I am not a trekkie as such and the last Star Trek I watched in its entirety twice was TNG... (I got the laser disks and watched them twice!) I dipped my toes in once or twice after that with DS9 and Enterprise but found very little to keep my attention.

So I'm talking from an OS, TNG standpoint.

One of the hallmarks of those classic Star Trek TV series was the generally unquestioned morals, generosity and bravery of the crew and their trust of each other, they were generally the best specimens that humanity (et al) had to offer, thrust together into seemingly impossible situations. And throughout their sometimes lengthy monologues and discourses on society, morality and politics there was never a cuss word nor a bitter, angry reflection on life that did not serve a purpose. And through the light humour and of course phaser action, never a swearword was uttered... On the flip side, of course, there was the oftentimes wooden acting and TV budget production and special effects.

Discovery seems to have completely overturned the criteria.

Blurred morality and self centred, closed minded crew who distrust each other and their captain; robotic staff who blindly follow orders without question and a dark, threatening atmosphere of impending doom and gloom.

Moreover, the crew are mostly seemingly bitter and angry with a palpable sense of loss and the plot's focus on the quotidian (for them) day today survival of the crew at war. That leaves little time for grander discussion or philosophical reflection and humour. On the flip side, the acting is (generally) very good and the budget and SFX is out of this world.

Basically, this has become any old gritty, hard hitting scifi drama more akin to The Expanse and Caprica than The Next Generation and DS9.

One last point... I have to nod at those 1★ reviews knowing full well that to them Star Trek is almost a religious experience and should not be denigrated by day to day grind and lowly pursuits... And swearing...

I'm a very sweary person IRL and love post watershed dramas where sex, realistic and sometimes harsh dialogue to convey a point are used but... the one notable instance of humour in the series so far was accompanied by a totally out of place F- bomb... I was literally so surprised at the suddenness of it I actually had to rewind it and watch the scene again. I honestly thought I'd misheard. This is the *FIRST* time in my life that I have ever thought the word F*** to be inappropriately used in a TV show...

As for using the name Star Trek, yes they might as well have used another name and changed the badge logo to square or something, it would have probably brought more to the table as a fresh milieu in which to set this otherwise reasonable production.

I'm hoping that this show will find its feet. It certainly as the budget and the cast and crew for it... Now all they need are some characters we can empathise with.",22 October 2017
"I like the show because he tech is better and parts about black alert is cool. Everyone has a starring roll which is great. The plots and execution of them makes you want to watch it twice to make sure you understood . A few other goofs - they listen to 200 year old music and they made being gay a big deal still after a few centuries. You know there is a big ending coming, but like the star trek of old it might fly over most of the audiences head.",11 April 2019
"Star trek is about inter species politics, technological gap, boundaries, exploration and ethics. Star trek is more like a projected future which portrays the best version of humanity possible. There is no place for dark future here as the core of this series.

Discovery is based on the original timeline. This series is supposed to happen after star trek enterprise. The technologies were a bit advanced for the timeline. The show failed to focus on earth's people, about the federation, dialogues that explain the psychology of the characters. Clearly, the directors of the series don't know star trek.

The vulcan logic, The klingon strength ,are all ignored comfortably in this show. The humans are shown as depressed warmongers

Klingons live by their honour. They aren't bald shiny orcs. These were unlike any klingons in the previous series. They are so different ( In a bad way). This show is pure graphical entertainment, no story, not prequel - like at all. There was no life to the story. Fan made star trek is way better than discovery.

"I am forced to write this review after only having seen the headings and ratings of the best reviews on page 1. All unfair criticism in my opinion and I gladly give my impressions of the first 2 episodes seen, before I read this critique.

I was very happy with the product's technical look, but did find the translations of the Klingons speech annoying to read, thereby missing the action on the screen. However, the fresh look of the Klingons made them look different and fiercer, 10 years before TOS. I did not mind this at all. TOS was made in the 60's when the technology available now did not exist. This series was made for viewers in 2017 who demand a superior product.

A new crew was delightful to watch, although the captain did not last very long. But we can expect the story of Michael only beginning now. After all, the craft they were all in was destroyed, so the escapades of Discovery is still to commence.

The story looks promising and I give it a 7's up.

"As general sci-fi entertainment, I'm marginally enjoying Discovery, somewhat interesting and well-made.. but just like the JJ movies, they're decent movies, they're not really Star Trek. Discovery is harsh, has a violent, harsh edge to it I don't find appealing. I like Jason Isaacs a lot, but I don't like Lorca, yet. Also, it is falling victim to an oft-repeated Hollywoodism... characters who are stubbornly stupid in the face of logic and good advice from other characters who have proved themselves.",19 October 2017
"I decided to update my review from 2/10 to 1/10. I see the average rating for Star Trek Discovery is still 7.2. Why?

First if you go to IMDB user reviews you will see all positive reviews on the top - why? Because the sorting method makes sure you see reviews from ""proper people"". But if you go to Rotten Tomatoes you will see that show is rated 86% by critics and 38% by audience. So there are ""intelligent critics"" and ""dumb audience"". And if you look at all that you know, that to be proper and intelligent person you need to like Discovery.

There is general consensus that Discovery puts politics on first place. I would say more - it's just a soap opera rethemed to be science fiction. I mean there is no science fiction here but there are uniforms and explosions and stars in the background. But whole story is like soap opera - this person love this person and they have feelings and they need and they want and they can't but they will and so on.

Is it wrong for the show to be extremely liberal and to be a soap opera? There are shows like that. And they are popular. Also Neftlix, which just removed Discovery from its catalogue is probably leader in creating such shows. So what went wrong?

Basically, there is very little common part between fans of science fiction and fans of soap operas. Yes, you see positive reviews which are from the ""supporters"" but they are not interested in science fiction, they just want to support they political views. They are very active in the Internet and they will always help ""proper shows"" to stay high in ratings. But do they really watch them? Do you see any specific words in these ratings? Or they are all about dumb people who don't understand modern Star Trek?

So for the science fictions fans - Star Trek Discovery is boring, because nothing interesting happens there. You can have some memories from old shows and you can be happy for a moment that you see starship again but that's all. For the soap opera fans - Star Trek Discovery is ""strange"" because why all these explosions and tech babble between the feelings and drama. It would be better without that. So they are more interested in Sex Education or Riverdale than Star Trek Discovery.

But the most important conslusion are ratings. You can read many positive ratings by ""critics"". By reading them you feel you are in some kind of alternative world. It means that not only Star Trek Discovery reviews but probably all reviews by ""critics"" are worthless. They are just sponsored content and articles by people who have no clue at all. If you want to know something about any other show - never read ""critics"" because you are hurting yourself by reading them.

But there is also positive thing - we can clearly see that more people are now aware that Discovery is failure. Maybe it will help Star Trek Strange New Worlds to be better.",5 December 2021
I say that just to make a point that i put up with a lot of drivel in seasons 2 & 3 but it seems like the (badly) hidden main agenda is to promote a particularly woke world view at the expense of plot and dialogue. This is compounded by the level of denial exhibited by the producers of the show.,10 February 2022
"These ships look like they belong in the post-TNG/DS9/VOY era. They look cool but they look out of place even DS9 and Voyager didn't have holographic technology that was so.....interactive.﻿ This is what happens when you let people that don't understand the material onto the project.﻿ and some people defending this crap? wow....﻿ I guess if you pretend it's not star trek it's worth watching. Voyager and DS9 easily trump this show. What a mess and what a disappointment. Phaser firing used to be a beauty to watch and so did torpedoes...now its just a mess...it sounds like farts...you can't really tell who's firing at you and that captain, despite being a good actress, shows no charisma or adrenaline on a bridge battle when comparing with Janeway, Cisco or Picard.",21 October 2017

"Dear self-proclaimed Star Trek geeks,

Stop whining! Move along! Not the original - We get it! BUT is really good and people need to see it. Let others enjoy a good TV Show. You have so many idiotic shows nowadays that deserve your whining, so back-off!! Keep your narrow and subjective opinion for yourself. It makes me mad to see so many negative comments about this series just because the show is not as the original one - well, guess what? it doesn't want to be the original. It is unique in its own way with pretty complex naratives and quite interesting. Actors and CGI is decent and well crafted. Myself, I grow-up with the original Star Trek and I can accept new things, other TV shows being part of the same univers. I recommend this tv show!",29 March 2019

"I read a lot of 1/10 - 5/10 reviews describing the flaws of this tv series; I'm not a fan, i've seen all the old movies (entertaining when i was younger), few episodes of the old (to my eyes unwatchable) legacy series; today on netflix you can find all the other series and, to experiment, i tried to watch the first two-three episodes of each one. This, to my personal taste, is actually pretty good. I found in this one things that were missing in the others, and even if to a very base low level, still some concepts, some talks, that could be considered worthy to be listened. It's not a matter of action and adventure, but a serious evolution of each character. Could they make it better? of course. Still it was pretty good.",14 February 2018
"S4 is just totally failed, such a bad script i didnt seen even in a low budget sitcoms. Good start and total fail in season 4.

"Discovery is so non-canon within the Star Trek universe as to be insulting to the original series and its fans. This show is supposed to take place 10 years before the original Trek, but if even half the technology on display had existed, the original Trek would make absolutely no sense. There is no coherence between Discovery and the previous Star Trek series and movies.

Furthermore, the moments in Discovery that reference the original show are largely comprised of cannibalism, not homages (for example, utterly ripping off the ""needs of the many..."" motif from ST II & III, appropriating this beloved aspect of those movies as though those lines were spoken decades earlier within the Trekverse).

The melodrama is interminable. The show is manipulative in its attempts to make us grieve the loss of tertiary characters - big, heavy attempts at emotional crescendos that are just not earned - and absurd ""big reveals"" which are equally unearned and sometimes come out of left field. Is if that all weren't bad enough, Shazad Latif is a terrible actor who lacks gravitas and charisma, and his ineptitude makes the eye-rolling emotionalism between his character and that of Sonequa Martin-Green even worse than they otherwise would have been.

Sonequa Martin-Green, Jason Isaacs, Anson Mount, and Michelle Yeoh are excellent actors who do what they can with their roles. There are some really cool moments, a bit of chemistry between some of the actors, and someplace in this disappointing, grossly overrated mess is a good show. I am baffled by the 7.1 IMDb score. I don't know how anyone who genuinely likes the Star Trek universe could approve of this show, nor anyone who enjoys consistently competent writing and coherent plots that don't rely on deus ex machina solutions. I suffered through two seasons and couldn't take it anymore.",17 December 2021
"Watched E03 just ago and it's getting better and better. Don't understand reviews after first episode that say it's crap.

Oasis, The Expanse and now StarTrek - we have great Scifi Shows today - just awesome!",3 October 2017
"I have to agree with several others; although I found Seasons 1 - 3 decent and watchable, Season 4 is just full of people crying and being emotional.

That is not what Star Trek is about, we don't want to see that, it's supposed to be a sci-fi show with drama and thrills, it's not Loose Women for 'crying' out loud, (forgive the pun).

If Season 5 is anything like Season 4, (that's if they make a Season 5 after the poor ratings of S4), then I won't be watching it.

The writers and producers have ruined what could have been a new lease of life for the Star Trek franchise.",18 March 2022
"Where, o where is the Zero rating that IMDB needs to add? This would certainly rate it. This absolute trash of a show takes fifty years of Star Trek (I've been watching since 1966) and flushes it down the toilet. There wasn't one episode worth watching in the entire first season. Not one. Let's see what's bad about this show.

1 - It seems that the show runners/writers know nothing about Star Trek. If they did, this wouldn't have been created. They also lied, claiming that this takes place in the real or original time line. No way.

2 - Here's the biggest question: If this is the prime time line, where has Spock's 'adopted human' sister been for FIFTY YEARS? In a coma? An alternate reality? Was he hiding her from Kirk? This is one of the absolute dumbest ideas ever. So because she was raised on Vulcan, does that make her able to be a Vulcan?

3 - Designs. The Discovery is one of the ugliest ships ever. It should be a Klingon ship. And since when to Federation ships have golden hulls? Which pinhead designed those horrible uniforms that look like they'd be rejected at Studio 54! As for the Klingon, Glenn Hetrick should be ashamed. Where the hell did they come from? They look like the only warring they would do is under a disco ball on a dance floor.

4 - Continuity. Let's just toss that to the winds. So the Federation knew about the Mirror universe at least ten years before Kirk discovered it? Why wasn't this in the databanks? Oh, we just wanted things to be cool. Yeah. Ok.

5 - the cast. Sorry but the guy playing the doctor looks WAY too young for the role. Perhaps he he were an alien, that might be different. Doug Jones is great, but the character he portrays is one of the sillier aliens. Oh, he can sense death can he? So can I - just put someone in a red shirt. Oh that's right - everyone's in those ridiculous disco uniforms.

6 - I know Bryan Fuller thinks it's cool (what an insipid concept) to give women Male names. Cool isn't a good enough reason. How about she's named after a relative who died in the service? See how simple?

This show is nothing but an obscene money grab for CBS. The sad part is, that those deluded fans who say ""All Trek is Good Trek"" may keep this alive for a while. I won't be one of them. I like quality writing, something this show is missing.",3 August 2018
"This was a train-wreck, one where I thought it could be recovered in the second season however just got worse and worse. I somewhat did enjoy the first season and there certainly are things I liked about this show, however it was just instantly undone in less than 5 minutes directly after. The cinematography did also look very nice in certain shots, but the writing and acting for the majority of the runtime was beyond bad. Emperor Philippa Georgiou was a fun character. Magic to Make the Sanest Man Go Mad was a memorable episode. The mirror universe always put a slime on my face. But everything else was bad or very bad.

"""It's a disgrace to the Star Trek legacy!""

""They've ruined Star Trek.""

""Klingons don't look like that!!! How DARE they change them!!!""

""Badly written schlock""

""Immature and silly""

""The science is ridiculous.""

""It's not cannon. X, Y, and Z all contradict the past.""

""The new captain is wrong for these reasons...""

""The crew is wrong for these reasons...""

These were all the same complaints and gasps of horror that were expressed when TNG first aired. Those of us who just loved sci-fi and Star Trek watched anyway, and pretty soon all those folks running around with their skirts thrown up over their heads joined in, and eventually let go of their complaints, then soon denied they ever made them. Thing was, it truly was a new generation. A new culture. Star Trek updated for that modern age. And now TNG not only is cannon, but it defines it. It is part of the legacy. Idolized and adored by all. OK, by most.

As far as the ""PC"" complainers go, well, they didn't have that term back in the 1960s when the first Star Trek aired, but if they had, the Archie Bunkers of the world would have been throwing it around with all the snide contempt and mock horror they could muster. TOS was shockingly, scandalously progressive. People hated DS9 for many of the same ""PC"" reasons. They'd never come out and say they hated a black captain and so many women running around in positions of authority, but they balked at the ""contrived"" political correctness of it all.

But the thing is, THAT is Star Trek's legacy: to explore social consciousness in allegorical form. To boldly go where close-minded people fear to go. It's the whole gig. Star Trek was born of challenging the conservative social norms. To criticize any Star Trek franchise as being too ""PC"" is ironically ridiculous. If that's your criticism, you don't get Star Trek . Yeah, yeah, I hear you thinking ""but this is taking it too far!"". Yes. The old stuff seems tame and mainstream now, but you need to understand that as it aired, it was infuriating the same types of people. It was as ""out there"" as they dared to get. Now they're daring further. That's why thy call the philosophy ""progressive."" It progresses.

OK, so Discovery is a complete mental adjustment. It is all SO very different. It's like, well, a new doctor playing Doctor Who. It will never be as good as the one we loved... until it is.

Discovery is taking it's time to get into swing, and starting with a war before establishing a baseline was a risky move, but I think the risk might just pay off. By the time our kids are scoffing at whatever form Star Trek takes in the coming decades, THIS will be the standard by which they judge THAT.

Of course, I approached ""Enterprise"" with the same optimism, so you can take my opinions with a grain of salt. Because... um... yeah. Let's just forget that one happened.",6 February 2019
"I'm a trekkie for close to 50 years, loved some ST series, tolerated other (DS9) and I tried hard to like ST Discovery in S1 but.... sigh. What happened with Roddenberrys legacy?! What happened with curiously discovering the universe, with the positive and light atmosphere? I can't believe I'm saying this but here it is: The Orville series was a way better ST successor. ST Discovery s1 overdid the CGI (looks more like a console game most of the time) and had no soul. As for the Klingons... geez, they looked like a totally other species. Where I was inpatient for every new episode of The Orville I found myself picking a new episode of ST Discovery s1 only when I was really bored. That says enough. EDIT: having said all of the above: season 2 is better, a lot better. The first episode alone had more Star Trek in it than all season 1 episodes combined. So... there is hope. I rated season 1 with 1 star. Season 2 gets better and better and therefor 8 stars (well 7 actually, but I added one encouraging them to continu improving the series). So Ill give it an overall of 6 stars for now, in hope of an even better third season. Maybe this series and their makers need time. If so : live in peace and prosper ;) EDIT again; halfway s3 I have to say that they finally got it right. Still not as goos as The Orville, but worth 8 stars non the less.",12 October 2019
OK If I cant find a cheat site I wont be watching more of this show cause I will not pay for all access but enough bitching about that part the show its self if a really good show the episode I watched really kept me entertained and was action packed I loved it and I liked the development of characters already 'if I can find another way to watch ' I will update on my thoughts in a few weeks,24 September 2017
I was not totally fine with the season 1 but seems Now they've grasped the essence of it in Season 2. Captain Pike himself have dragged me in to this and those alternative story lines alongside the main one are really the key to a good show.,5 March 2019
"Space...the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Discovery. Its ambiguous mission, to start new wars, to seek out new strife and fake looking Klingons, to coldly throw away the cannon that existed before!

OK it's not too horrible a show. It's not that good either. Don't get me started on those ridiculous Klingon knockoffs--Perhaps we should call those creatures ""KLINGOFFS""--they certainly ARE NOT KLINGONS!

The spore drive requires a massive suspension of disbelief. I mean, it's now in the realm of FANTASY and not SCIENCE FICTION.

If they called this show any other name and not Star Trek, I might enjoy it more. Heck, if they made it into a SEQUEL instead of a PREQUEL...it will make more sense.

I find myself enjoying The Orville (awesome show btw) far more than Star Trek Discovery.

I hope they actually do FIX all these inconsistencies and stupid crap they've introduced before they hit the TOS Timeline!",16 November 2017
"Season 1 was pretty good, needed some polish and a little more ""Trekishness"" but overall enjoyable. The action and excitement made up for the woke add ins, not to mention the high end special effects. A solid 8 stars.

Season 2 was not as good. The writing and the story seems disconnected from season 1. The action was not as good and it was boring at times. Dropped to 5 stars in a hurry. Still have hope.

Season 3 was boring and nearly painful. What happened? Did they fire the writers and just use free interns? Did the show runner start using (or stop using) drugs? Now sitting at 4 stars.

Season 4 was (and is) some kind of woke-fest soap opera of boredom that is so far off course they might as well just cancel the series. I don't see them being able to come back from the pointless and unentertaining story lines that have made this series drop from an 8 to a 2. I hope they don't destroy the new Trek series the way they destroyed this one.",24 March 2022

"Look, this show simply isn't Star Trek. It's something else riding on the great name that Star Trek has built over decades and deficating upon it in so many terrible ways I'm utterly shocked any long time Star Trek fan will enjoy this drivel at all???? The great DC Fontana who put so much love and care into the great character known famously the world over as Spock would be rolling in her grave at this complete abomination of a series. It ignores Star Trek cannon, it plagiarised from a video game called 'Tardigrades"",(which it seems to be getting away with because CBS has deeper pockets than a small Indy developer.). It opens so many violations to the timeline, I can't believe Q has not appeared and destroyed it instantly. The worst aspect of all is the complete reimagining of the Klingons making them unrecognisable from anything at all in the series before it. There's some great actors and I couldn't care less about the woke crap and the gay scenes. What's offending me to the core is how badly it contradicts and changes the Star Trek works before it, that it simply may as well ignore it all together. This series is almost like simply ignoring the great 6 series before it and simply starting again. Well this fan loved thos 6 series and all the books and audio adventures that sprang from them and is appalled at the total disregard for all that great work and that's what is making my blood boil more than anything. By all means start your own unique series, but don't poorly use tis bits and rewrite it all to suit your new series. Simply make it a whole new show U less your prepared to put the research and dedication in to really make it work. The poor Okuda's, what must be running through there heads for one.

"I was one of those who had written a less than benevolent review at the end of Episode 1x04 of Star Trek: Discovery and had claimed the spoof Star Trek series The Orville was far better in understanding the Star Trek idea and universe than this new CBS-Netflix series.

ST Discovery proved to be an excellent series with great character development, good acting, and a good story arch that turned out to be solid, interesting, and gritty. I am so glad this series exists and I am very pleased to have been proven wrong.

Personally I find this show highly entertaining as a ""trekkie"" myaelf. I like my Trek shows to be more intellectual, than animated mostly, and it's show pleasantly fits the billing you see.

"Just finished season 2 and was surprised to see so many negative reviews on here. Turns out the vast majority were left over a year ago - I have to admit I had my moments where I thought this series was going to be dead on arrival but I'm very glad I stuck it through. Really loved the way they tied in the pre-ToS timeline in and all the energy spent on explaining certain potential plot-holes. Yes there were a couple eye-roll moments but on the whole this was an excellently written and really amazingly acted series. Sometimes, I have to admit, it was a little over-acted but I don't mind a little forced drama in the ST universe. I watch a little Orville when I need a palate cleanser as it's the extreme polar opposite. Highly recommend people watch through the entire series before passing judgement as there's a lot to like here!",6 May 2019
"There's a character in the show who, in the first episode, talks about how his species was genetically engineered to sense death, and that he could sense it was coming for the crew -- unfortunately, I think death is coming for this series.

What's wrong with it? Everything! It's shot badly, it's scripted terribly, the acting is stereotypical and cliché. It has very little to do with Star Trek, and seems to be trying to be more like The Expanse, but if you want to watch The Expanse you should just watch The Expanse.

They turned the Klingons into the bad guys out of Stargate. The crew squabbles and commits mutiny, and then just carries on like nothing happened. The Vulcans are annoying and the actors aren't very Vulcan-like. In short, meh.",25 September 2017
"I am a big fan of trek. I grew up with TNG so by all the reviews and should hate discovery.. i do not!

Yes the spore drive is no more far fetched than all the time travel and what not plots in TNG and voyager so im not sure why people are complaining.

green (michael) carries hard. The ships captain is equally amazing of an actor. Frankly outside the nerd girl and crazy emperor woman the cast is likable and does very well. So there are 2 gay men in the crew... but is it any more far fetched that data in TNG creating a child twice? it is not. The weird social themes have always been present in trek.

Yes the klingons are very tough cookie to swallow but you get to blame copyright for that.. its not like they made them like that both in looks and behavior because they wanted to; they had to in order to avoid lawsuits.

"In the entire pantheon of Star Trek spin offs, this one started off impresively and had me enthused. But then something happened. I started to notice a few things. Let me explain. You know how some of the shows that last a few years, start strong and then the quality of the writing drops off and subsequently so does the audience? Well, in Star Trek Discovery, that quality drop happened around the middle of the first season for me. From the amateurish fight scene choreography in Episode 13 to the increasingly silly character Saru who is the commander of the USS Discovery. The makup just doesn't quite do the job. And the feet? The characters makup and design is, well, just plain riduculous. The makup and design of the Klingons is not well concieved either. The thick voices seem fake and put on. They do not allow this viewer to suspend disbelief which is critical for a sci-fi offering. The technology of the Star Trek Universe is a key player in it's success and when these characters talk tech, it's just pretend and it shows. It's obvious that the actors are simply spouting gibberish about ""Spore Drives"" and such. There is an interesting reference to Paul Stamets in the charactor of the same name in Lieutenant Paul Stamets. (The real Mr. Stamets is an american born mycologist and proponent of bioremediation and the use of medicinal fungii. There is a magic mushroom fan in the writing crew.) Perhaps this fall off for me had something to do with the exit of Brian Fuller, who created the ""universe"" that these charactors inhabit. I'm not sure but as a lifelong fan of the original show and it's spin-offs, this one fell from grace around the middle of the season or sooner. When I first read this collection of reviews for this show, I saw an absolute RASH of 1 and 2 ratings. I now see a rash of 10 ratings. So I can plainly see that CBS All Access has deployed their minions in order to maintain the ridiculous 7.4 rating. I see the scores of low ratings for this POS and the 7.4 is obviously a sham.

UPDATE: I decided to give the second season a whirl and it started off nicely with some of the elements that we all know and love that make Star Trek, Star Trek. But things quickly detiorated. The chronic over-acting of Sonequa Martin-Green as Michael Burnham speaks of a character that hasn't spent 5 minutes in the same room as a Vulcan, much less having been raised on the planet with a Vulcan Family. And of course the utterly silly character Saru hasn't been killed off yet. And to my utter dismay the show has further worsened to the point that a full 20 minutes of the 1 hour show is devoted to commercials. If there were a rating lower than ""1"" I would give it.",31 July 2018
"The writing is on the level of children.

The human moral values are akin to villains.

All I can say is this show feels like it was created by people who don't realize they are the intolerant prejudice ones. To put it nicely.

It's sad to see something like Star Trek and what it use to stand for, and now see how low the show has fallen. They dug down as far as they could with shovels until they hit bed rock. They didn't stop there, they hooked up some jackhammers and are now working on the bedrock.",7 April 2022
"I just noticed that I never updated the review I wrote of this series after two episodes. But the series is so much better than I expected that I must rectify that!

The first season of Star Trek started out decently. Good cast, pretty good storyline. It was enjoyable enough.

And then interesting stuff started happening.

The whole Federation/Klingon war was pushed out of the way by a series of extraordinary events. Things that had happened early on that I didn't like turned out to offer really compelling results later in the story arc.

I'm most of the way through season 2 and so satisfied. There are a lot of great characters, notably Tilly and Georgiou (brilliantly played by Michelle Yeoh). And Micheal is an excellent take on Star Trek's too-goo-to-be-true-self-sacrificing hero model.

Towards the end of season 2 there was some lazy writing, but overall the plotting has been terrific. This started as a show I thought was decent, but it become one of my favorites.

For comparison, here is my original review 7/10 Promising, with the biggest issue being some of the same old Star Trek nonsense

After watching the opening two-parter, I am mildly hopeful for Discovery. More so than I was for Voyager, less than for DS9. The pacing and dialogue were pretty good, there were a couple of interesting characters, and the beginning seems to set up a different series structure than that of previous series. This is why I disagree with the many who think focusing on a brilliant but mutinous character is a bad idea. (On the other hand, I feel like I'd rather watch a series about Michael's first days on Star Fleet, since she was more interesting in the flashback than in the present day.

The approach is more like the dumb action of Star Trek Into Darkness than the actual sci-fi of the original or TNG. But I am not so attached to Star Trek that I am unwilling to judge this series on itself rather than its predecessors, and for a mindless action series I think this works pretty well. It's no Killjoys (a smart action series), but it's enjoyable.

While some complain about superficial changes in technology (do we really want clunkier technology just to fit in with a low-budget '60s TV series) or the increased gender diversity, I was mainly bothered by a holdover from the original: the captain personally does all the most dangerous stuff. This series has gone backward from TNG in this regard, and, with its *two* *member* landing parties, takes a stupid idea and makes it worse.

It's not great, yet, but then, TNG wasn't so hot at first either. I would say that this series is good enough that something good could come from it. Or not.",27 September 2017
"I like the new Star Trek movies, they bring action and entertainment. But they never gave me that true Trek feeling. There was to much ""fast and he furious"" feeling (Yet again, I do like the new movies)

Yes there are some changes made to certain race appearances, etc. But they are still very recognizable. I embrace the changes, they are done well. Cool effects, cool ships, great choice of actors and the music brings chills to my back.

I am so pleased to have a good space opera back on ""smallscreen""

If they can keep up what they started in the two first episodes, this might climb to the top alongside with the best of them.

But, as always with any new Star Trek shows: You will either hate or love it.

"For starters it's dark...and that's really NOT Star Trek. Star Trek is optimistic and light even when it goes a little gritty. It's supposed to be an optimistic future where Earth strives for a Utopia...and Discovery isn't that at all.

Discovery is bleak and pessimistic and really, that's not what I want when I want to sit down and watch Star Trek.

And then it's weighted in the present, and again, that's not what I want in science fiction.

A reflection of the present is fine...a satire on it is fine...but to try and anchor the plots so much in the present that it becomes BLATANT...that's not science fiction anymore.

And then what did they do to the orcs...I'm sorry, Klingons? In a prequel series? I know they have always micro-evolved in appearance but this is insanely different.

They are so different that it's almost insulting to even the casual fan let alone their loyal base.

And then, yeah, like so many other shows it does that thing where it's almost racist towards the ONE demographic that it is currently politically correct to be racist against...and that's not Star Trek either, if anything, it's the opposite because that was intended to be solved a long, long time ago in the franchise's history.

The Klingons are the bad guys for NOT wanting the Federation to cleanse them of their culture and heritage...they are written as the bad guys for NOT wanting to be ethnically cleansed!!!!!!

I know it's a play on White Supremacy, but seriously, this does NOT make the Federation look like the good guys here. Now, if the Klingons wanted to Ethnically cleanse OTHER groups, that would make them look like the bad guys. NOT the other way around.

Ultimately, like the new Star Wars, it seems intent on alienating it's base entirely.",20 November 2018
"I've willed this show to be great but sadly it's gradually gotten worse and worse, to the point where I feel I have to bail after I finish this third season. Despite its flaws I enjoyed season one, largely due to Jason Isaacs. Season two saw a drop in quality but was saved by Anson Mount as Captain Pike and Rebecca Romijn as his number one. The quality has plummeted so hard in this third season it's becoming painful to watch.

I agree with the reviewer who called it a CW teen fantasy. That's exactly what it's become. The show is just a constant barrage of pretty special effects and heart tugging emotions cranked to the max. On previous Trek shows going right back to the 1960's if the crew were given a mission they suited up and just got on with it. After the mission was completed the captain would acknowledge a job well done and they moved on to the next. These people are the elite in their fields, much like astronauts they detach their emotions to concentrate on getting the job done. You'd get the occasional scene of high emotion, if a crew member was lost, but the joy of the series was always in their ability to solve seemingly impossible problems and pull together as a team for the greater good in a professional and badass way. You'd get tearful scenes maybe a couple of times a season.

This doesn't happen in Discovery. Before missions they hug each other, look tearful and constantly remind each other how wonderful they all are. On completion they have a huge circle jerk and tearfully compliment each other on their magnificence. This season they even had a tearful goodbye for a mass murdering despot who showed the crew nothing but contempt. It's absurd and completely tiresome. They also underscore these scenes with swelling orchestral music just in case you don't realize you're meant to be getting the feels along with this bizarre and excessively emotional crew.

The crew are so thinly written it's almost impossible to remember their names. Three seasons in and I couldn't tell you the name of any of them outside of the main core of Burnham, Saru, Tilly and Stamets. At this point I'm past caring. The acting is soap opera level. The character Burnham is overused and doesn't warrant the amount of screen-time she gets. The writers seem oblivious to this and have the crew constantly remind us how wonderful she is by showering her with compliments. Apparently she's even responsible for making Spock into the man he became. It's a shame we can't experience any of Burnham's God-like powers of charisma on the show because all we see is her crying and being insubordinate. It's bizarre. If you constantly need to remind the audience how awesome and wonderful your Captain is chances are she isn't. And believe me, she isn't.

Sadly it seems the makers of STD are less concerned with interesting, logical and entertaining story telling and more concerned with ticking the right number of politically correct boxes. They've even thrown in some cute robots who I can only imagine would appeal to small children. Who are they making this show for? It's a complete mess, with its nonsensical storylines hurtling along at 100mph with no room for character building or rumination. As for the cause of the Burn the less said about that the better.

This show had so much potential but is now just an embarrassing addition to the Star Trek family. I'm out.",27 January 2021
"The storylines in seasons 1-3 were strong enough for the viewer to blank out the egregious identity politics, just about. Season 4 disappears up it's own fundament, it's so bad I suspect Disney must have had a hand in it.

My 3 star rating is weighed (since revised downward), with season 4 getting zero stars (since revised downward), it's atrocious. Frankly the emphasis in season 4 moves onto characters who are badly written one-dimensional characterisations of whatever hashtags are trending.

This is straight up social engineering done excruciatingly badly. It doesn't ask\challenge the viewer, it tells them. It's like a bad HR instructional video that a company's insurers insist all employees watch. Cringe.

Moreover, the physical changes in one character between seasons are so profound that it's actually unsettling for the viewer. If one of the key actors lost a leg between seasons it would bear explanation in the show, it's sci-fi action so should be easy but discovery is so right-on it daren't mention these incredibly stark changes. A literal and metaphorical elephant in the room.

Update: I forced myself to watch this to the end of s4. It's actually considerably worse than my initial review. This is the antithesis of Star Trek. Roddenberry must be spinning in his grave at warp 10 given how his message of hope, inclusivity, maturity and understanding has been so terribly bastardised. I'm sickened by this show. Kind regards, former Trekkie.",9 January 2023
"Martin-Green's breathy delivery with every line spoken is ANNOYING. She has one note for EVERYTHING. Each season is one long story with convoluted storyline that's hard to engage in. It rambles in so much trek-speak you can skip episodes and be as informed as if you watched every episode. Special effects are stellar, multi-cultural/ethnic cast is a welcome sight, but please re-cast Martin-Green or send her to a drama school diction class to learn to modulate her delivery.",20 March 2022
"I thought it was very good. The Klingons are different to other TV shows/Moves so expect that. Overall I am looking forward to watching more and it just a shame that the older trek fan base it giving the show a hard time because its nothing like the outdated TOS and it also seems that they want a show that will not fit in with today's society. Yes I get that this is set after Captain Archer and before Kirk and that the technology used on the U.S.S. Shenzhou that doesn't line up with canon, such as the holograms Captain Georgiou uses to communicate with Admiral Anderson. That kind of holographic technology shouldn't exist for another century, when Star Trek: Deep Space Nine introduced it on the U.S.S. Defiant. This also may be a clue that the destruction of the U.S.S. Kelvin that occurred in 2233 affected the timeline of Discovery, which takes place in 2256. Time will tell.",25 September 2017
"How can anyone find this less than entertaining? From a purely sci-fi perspective it's compelling. Stories have been laid out in interesting arcs, the entire spore drive concept adds new flavour to the genre. The characters are well fleshed out and interesting. The visuals are next level and how all previous incarnations of the universe wish they had looked. There is nothing to disparage there. From a sociological point of view it is current and espouses all the values of an Earth that has been touted since TOS. Biases and prejudices dispensed and an open and accepting culture boldly venturing into a galaxy of unknowns. Everyone is represented in this new series and not a token in sight. From a Trek point of view, this ticks every box. Loyalty, curiosity, exploration, valor, compassion, duty, friendship, and love. Between the overarching series themes and story, they have interwoven small compelling adventures that showcase the very heart of what it means to be Starfleet and how that can be shown in a fresh, modern way, while still tipping the occasional hat to those who paved the way. Keep up the good work ST:D, you've got it right.",27 April 2019
"The 2 first episodes are very entertaining, still in the universe of the original TV series and the ""Rick Berman's TV series (some episodes were a bit boring, same narrative structure per episode,...).

Make me forget the atrocious movies of JJ Abrams. Justin Lin kept a little of the original ""soul"" of the TV show but still crap.

For Discovery, you like it or dislike it, but they took the ""look and feel"" of JJ Abrams: lens flares, camera work (weird angles),...

Yes, the tech is more advanced than in the TOS, but as a Star Trek fan, it needed a very fresh look.

The production values are better than the short lived Enterprise: original designs (ships, costumes, make-up...), visual effects,... Excellent cast.

After the 2-parts pilot episode, the story unfolds slowly in the next episodes. Can wait to watch the next ones.

BTW, It was nice to see back Rainn Wilson (I liked him in The Office).",25 September 2017

"First season is good, second season is excellent, third season is okay and the fourth season is unwatchable

Mary Wiseman's absence seems to mark the shows complete collapse.

"There's woke and then there's -- Imma choke you out unless you swallow everything I put on your plate-- woke. I'm throwing up. Huge Star Trek fan, but this (as well as Picard) try too hard to shove 2020's agenda's down our throats rather than futuristic fantastical ideals.",21 March 2022
"Did I watch the same program as others that are giving this a one star and complaining? The show blew me away! Of course, I paid for CBS Access and have already watched the second episode so for those that complain of ""cardboard"" characters, give it a rest...it's the first episodes! I have quickly become invested in the backstory of Michael Burnham as well as the Klingons. And complaining about the CGI? Technology has changed so much over the last 50 years that what is available to movie makers and TV directors/producers is so far advanced from the original series...even from the days of TNG, Enterprise, and the others. Enjoy the technical improvement instead of bashing it. Costumes and makeup are extraordinary. Acting is great, actors well chosen for their roles. And the more episodes filmed, the more we learn about characters...they flesh out. Actors become more comfortable in their roles and have more story line to work with to develop their backstories. (Don't believe me? Watch the first couple of episodes of TMG and observe how wooden the actors were in their roles but they grew in to them quickly). So if you find it unwachable? Don't bother to sign up for CBS All-Access. I hadn't planned to but it's worth the low cost of putting up with commercials just to watch this show every week.",24 September 2017

"There is little or no structure to this nightmare of Science Fiction.

It purports to show the Federation before Kirk, Spock and company, yet almost everything on this farse is light years (forgive the pun) ahead of the time of kirk and advanced when compared to NCC 1701!.

What therefore, is the point of Discovery?.

The acting is Awful!, with very, very FEW exceptions!. There is absolutely no regiment, order or recognition of the Federation being a military like organisation. Little or no respect for the Captain, who is more often in some unexplained argument which leads no where and makes little sense.

I can not think what the script writers get paid for, a relatively well educated 10 year old child who viewed even only 2 episodes of Kirks Star Trek, could do better, far better!

It is actually offensive to Trek fans, who treasure Star Trek and actually relive all of the original shows and could find the most unacceptable of holes in this failed attempt.

WHY?, Why take a gem, a childhood memory cherished by literally hundreds of millions of fans Worldwide and butcher it in such a way?.

My personal memory of Star Trek goes back many years! (1970's) to a young boy, sitting beside his Father enjoying Sci-fi, a chance to dream, a moment between A Father and his young son.

WHY take what so many love and cherish, only to destroy it for so very many?.

I frankly only managed 5 episodes, then gave up wondering what Leonard Nimoy would think about this mess.

It is exactly THAT! A Dreadful Mess! Which has hijacked the Star Trek brand.

How it lasted beyond 1 season is bewildering!.",7 March 2022
"This is NOT Star Trek. I'm at a loss as to how it has such a high rating. It feels like Chronicles of Riddick. I seriously feel like any moment the necromongers are going to pop out of the walls.

The Klingons are like the monsters under a childs bed. And why is their speech so mumbled?

I love Michele Yeoh, and they gave her this to work with? What happened to the writing? It's like kindergartners wrote it.

If they can't be bothered to make something of quality that shows they respect the source material, then they need to stop trying.",27 September 2017
"I'm an avid space scifi fan. Saying that, I feel we don't get enough quality space sci fi shows. There's almost too many comedy/drama shows that don't take themselves too seriously. This was a welcome gift in the land of scarce quality scifi TV shows.

It feels like you're watching a movie, not a TV show. It's akin the recent Star trek movies in terms of special effects/production value/writing/cinematography.

The closest quality space scifi show I can liken this to is the Expanse, but since I'm a Star Trek fan I would rate this even higher for the type of show Star Trek is in general.

Surprising this is on CBS and not the syfy channel. But the scifi channel cares about B and C level scifi crap (except the Expanse).

PS:This isn't like the Orville (another show I had high hopes for but turned out it doesn't take itself seriously either). Don't come to this show as a star trek fan looking for some sort of continuity or story-line connection to the previous star trek TV shows (like Enterprise, voyager, DS9, or next Gen). Rather come to this with a goal of starting something new in a similar universe with great writing and movie production value and none of that comedic crap added that makes the Orville so horrible for a space scifi fan like me.",24 September 2017

"This 'Star Trek' series is set between the end of 'Enterprise' and the beginning of 'Star Trek' (The Original Series). Protagonist Commander Michael Burnham is stripped of rank and charged with treason after her actions in the opening episode lead to the death of her captain and the starting of a war against the Klingons. As she is being transported to prison her shuttle fails and is rescued by the USS Discovery. While aboard she is ordered by Discovery's captain, Gabriel Lorca, to assist with a crucial experiment. Its success leads to her joining the crew.

Burnham is human but after her parents were killed by Klingons when she was a child she was raised on Vulcan by a Vulcan father and a human mother alongside their son Spock.

The first season is concerned with the war against the Klingons and an incursion to the Mirror Universe where a belligerent Terran Empire rules in place of the Federation. In the second season involves a hunt for Spock, who has been accused of murder, and a mysterious time travelling entity known as the 'Red Angel' who appears to have been leaving clues to warn of something that could end all sentient life in the galaxy.

I can understand why some people don't think this is 'proper Star Trek' as it has darker toned, longer running story lines and features more advanced technology than series set later. However I recall people saying 'The Next Generation' wasn't proper Star Trek as there were no 'red shirts' dying on every away mission and the original series had no need for a councillor... then people realised it was great on its own terms. In the same way this series has the potential to be great, after two seasons it is too soon to make that claim yet. I'm enjoying it though. The characters are good; many of them more ambiguous than one might expect; good guys turn out to be villains and villains turn good... after a fashion. Much of the technology on the Discovery does seem too advanced at first but in some cases that is because it has to look advanced compared to now; something it the bridge of the original series Enterprise would no longer do. Without going into details by the end of season two we get good explanations as to why much of the tech isn't even talked about in previous series set after this.

The cast does a fine job with Sonequa Martin-Green impressing as Michael Burnham, the character who dominates the series, perhaps a little too much. Fine support comes from Doug Jones as Commander Seru, Discovery's First Officer; Mary Wiseman as Sylvia Tilly, Burnham's roommate; Jason Isaacs as Captain Gabriel Lorca and Anthony Rapp as Paul Stamets, the Chief Engineer. I'd like to mention other people too but that might involve spoiling fun details of the show.

The series certainly delivers for those wanting impressive action, long running storylines and plenty of plot twists. As with previous Star Trek series this does its bit for diversity without it being explicitly talked about... there are characters of various races (and species) as well and a main character who is gay; this is all dealt with in a matter of fact way rather than being an issue; one would hope that nobody will bother about such things hundreds of years from now.

Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of 'Star Trek'... if it turns out you don't like it you can always drop it. As for me I'm looking forward to season three.",26 February 2020

"If I were to write everything that is wrong and not ""Star Trek"" about this show, you'd be reading for far too long. There are some good moments. However, they are not as common as the ""soap opera"" moments. The focus on interpersonal & ""family"" relationships just run far too long throughout each season. If they would have only shortened these story aspects, it would've been a great show. There are ""goodbye scenes"" that last multiple episodes. I remember thinking: ""if i wasn't watching this on a stream (and could fast forward) , I would be so angry. Thank goodness the 'Star Trek Strange New Worlds' series was created. That is a TRUE Star Trek show!",1 September 2022
"""Star Trek: Discovery"" has been trading on Star Trek's good name for four series. Enough. Put an end to it.

There have been huge problems all along.

In the first season we were subjected to lengthy Klingon dramas. The Klingons looked different - for no apparent reason - and the dramas were delivered in Klingon, with subtitles, because we wouldn't want to offend any Klingons by not respecting their language. Klingons were dropped. Rightly so.

The series was placed in time just before the original Kirk/Spock series. 5 minutes of thinking would have revealed the problem here: in several areas tech in 2021 is more advanced than the tech Spock and Kirk played with. Cell phones a far more capable than communicators. Touch screens have done away with the need of rows and rows of mechanical buttons. Eventually, the producers figured this out and moved ""Discovery"" to the 32nd century.

In ""Star Trek the Next Generation"" we were introduced to Reginald Barclay, a man with problems, whose superior intellect enabled him to contribute despite his issues. Now, ""Discovery"" has an entire ship of Barclays - including the captain!

The current season is full of squishy emotions. In episode 2 of series 4 (Anomaly) the following characters had emotional scenes: Burnham, Stamets, Tilly, Adira, and Booker. The only two major characters that remain grounded are Saru and Dr. Culber.

""The First,"" ""Away,"" and ""Defying Gravity"" are all TV sci-fi series. The have two things in common. Each series delved heavily into the emotions and personal lives of the characters while rolling out the actual sci-fi drama at a leisurely pace. Secondly, each series was canceled quickly, lasting 8, 10 and 13 episodes respectively. If ""Discovery"" was not wearing the mantle of Star Trek the plug would have been pulled long ago.

When it comes to sci-fi TV it has to be about the sci-fi. If you want the other, watch ""Grey's Anatomy"" as it does a much better job.

Then there is the character of Michael Burnham. Leaving aside the fact that Spock had an adopted human sister - something not mentioned in the first 50 years of Star Trek - Michael was raised Vulcan. Any semblance of her Vulcan upbringing is now completely gone as she stumbles and blubbers from scene to scene at a rate that would have embarrassed even James T. Kirk. This leaves Burnham unbelievable as Captain and unlikeable as a character. Likability of the captain has been key to every Star Trek series - even the less important/central Ben Sisko of ""Deep Space Nine.""

One last shot. The opening credits of ""Discovery,"", which are a dull as dirt, last 90 seconds. The original ""Star Trek's"" opening titles, with the immortal, ""These are the voyages..."" were 60 seconds long.

Do yourself a favour. Instead of watching the continuing calamity that is ""Discovery,"" re-Discover a sci-fi/fantasy series, that in addition to being great, fanciful, and humorous, had opening credits were a breathtaking 11 seconds in length, ""Warehouse 13.""",5 December 2021

It's a different concept but there is no Starfleet structure I'm sorry but they pick the wrong people to play star trek especially the one they pick for captain big mistake the alien commander should have been captain.

So far seen the first 2 episodes. And tired of the haters. this is actually good. Is everything perfect far from it. But at least Wesley Crusher is not in it. some people whining about this is not TNG well to bad for you TNG was okish later seasons had its merits but was nothing like the original series. graphic wise the klingons could have stayed more like the original. then again but worf well worf did not look at all like the klingons in the original series. I actually watched it without TNG bias and liked it during the original things where not nice and happy trekking in space.,25 September 2017
"This series really is more painful to watch than Star Trek Strange New Worlds, which at least has some semblance of order. If your a star trek fan, if your not, I can't see any good reason to watch it at all.

The story line of Michael Burnham growing up as Spocks adopted sister should send up red flares like a supernova, but the massacre that took place on the intellectual creativity of the original series was something I wasn't prepared for.

I've never really understood the necessity of the franchise to continually return to the 'Kirk' era, particularly given the 'Picard' era was such a successful one. Besides which, if you can't create an interesting story from a hundred and fifty billion stars in a galaxy and thousands of sentient races in a continual state of evolutionary and socio-galactic flux, then you should give up your job as a screen writer.

It's true the Star Trek Movies do the 'return to Kirk' thing with some success, and driven by the requirement for financial return I do understand this to some degree, but the Star Trek fans of today are not the fans of the 1960's and paying homage to Kirk, Spock and the Enterprise crew is a threadbare cloth on which to lay your table, particularly if the meal is a messy one. This one is, and there isn't easy way to stomach it without the possibility of it returning to your plate without some very strong medicine.

I managed to make it through series one, with great difficulty, and took a considerable break before beginning the second series in the hope it had matured somewhat and the quality had improved. Unfortunately this hasn't happened, in fact three episodes in and it's very clear the standards have fallen further.

It's a gloomy depressing world of Star Trek, dark and foreboding in its essence. Homage is paid to all our contemporary social groups which makes it feel oddly political, but this is more a reflection on how it's oddly shoehorned into the series without due care and attention.

Gone are the simplistic encounters and issues of the old enterprise that anyone with a third grade education could follow. The story here twist and meanders into an intricate tale of rights, wrongs, deceit, intrigue and complexity that seems to have a life of it's own. Star Trek Deep Space Nine did this with some success, though there was never the intense focus on making these complex themes the main focus of individual episodes, and that is why I think that series was so successful with this method. Here, these complex story themes have become the main substance of each of the episodes and it has become a little tiresome.

I personally think Sonequa Martin-Green is miscast here. I was waiting for her to become more holistic with her character as it did with her part in 'The Walking Dead' but it hasn't really happened and her portrayal still seems wooden and misplaced much of the time. This may be down to bad direction, but I don't see any of the other characters suffering from this shortcoming. Quite the opposite in fact, she stands out as the weak link because the rest of the cast have taken on their personas so well.

That said, let me be clear, she is not the cause of the series being so unpalatable. Its not (for the most part) a bad story, but its messy and clunky, in need of an accomplished hand to bring it in line, and some competent script writers to save it... which of course will not happen.

Ok so I won't be watching any more I've managed to get three episodes into season two, and for that I think I deserve a medal, but the writing has been on the wall for a long time with this series and any additional investment in time watching it is pointless.",17 October 2022

In seasons past, we were fully engaged with old preciously lost characters like Spock coming back. It was great for the lore.

Unfortunately now and especially within season 4, we have moved away from the cool science, problem solving and gritty battle scenes and into a quest of emotional self-discovery character by character.

New plot : who am I? I feel things! How do I cope? I need a hug!

Feels like a soap opera. Can I just say enough with the softness and more science and space please. I mean, even the AI computer is currently having an emotional existential crisis.

"I love the original 1966-69 Star Trek, it was a milestone in many fields.

Star Trek the Generation never really excited me I gave up after episode 3. It's too politically correct and nice. Even the Movie versions are like extended TV episodes. It never really moved on. Enterprise tended to follow in Generations foot steps

But I loved DS9 and Voyager, again they set new bench marks. But still they all have that Rick Berman & Brannon Braga feel.

DISCOVERY, I love also, contrary to what people say comparing it and wanting it to be like GENERATION style. You can't just do that, you have to break the mould. New Producers, including Movie greats like Nicholas Meyer(Wrath of Khan & Undiscovered Country) director of the Best two Star Trek Movies to date, Akira Goldsmith, Alex Kurtzman and Bryan Fuller to boot.

The new series takes a new direction, using ideas from the Rebooted Star Trek Movies(Chris Pine) but not in that path or universe, only the Klingons are similar.

The Design of the Star Ship was one of the original designs from the 1970s reboot Phase2 but never used The atmosphere of the series, which I don't think many have pointed out is totally opposite to previous Star Trek series, the lighting is darker objects are not designed in a way of soft round edges society. Life is in a state of still learning nothing is yet accomplished as a perfect society.

The Characters all have strong flaws yet, in modern society are we to think they would pass such tests of space flight. This is what I like deep character driven series, not robotic slap on the wrist lifestyle of the prime directives. This is like what if ..?",15 December 2018
"I saw the first episode of Star Trek as a kid. I've followed and seen all 40+ years of them many times more than once. My motto: ""Everything you need to know in life you can learn from Star Trek"". That said, I liked the shows. Both episodes to date. I look at it this way; It may be a different Star Trek, but it's decent scifi. The first shows look promising. Yes rough around the edges. I'm giving it a chance to evolve. I too like stand alone episodes. This one looks like a continuation. Opera as some say. I just hope they don't make it too heavy. Shows like Stargate. SG-1 and Atlantis kept the same formula. A tight crew and a comic relief one. i.e. Teil'c and Rodney. Star trek invented that concept. Tight crew with comic actor that provided levity. Shows like Stargate Universe and even Battlestar Galactica were 'heavy' to watch over time. They had to end in three years. Good shows, but you can't keep up a steady diet of it. Will Discovery become more like SG-1 and the older treks or more like the 'heavy's'?

On another note. The killer might be the pay-per-view that CBS is doing. People will watch Discovery on CBS but I don't think it will draw many to purchase another viewing account. I'm seeing them on Kodi so I'll see them all. I probably would skip them I I had to sign up for a pay account on CBS.

Season 2 update.... Wow, what a change. So much better. Pike and the retro story line has done it.",25 September 2017
"Let's just cut to the point here: what people are really complaining about is that the people who worked on 25 years of Star Trek shows from next generation to enterprise are no longer working on Star Trek, and those are the people who made everything look the way that we remember it all through the 90s and through all of the Star Trek movies as well, because it was the same crew that created all of the ships all of the affects all of the uniforms.

Therefore there was a continuity between all of the movies and the shows because Paramount was the only company that owned it and they hired the same people over and over again to make the show look good and it did at that

However since UPN was vaporized, CBS now owns the television aspect of Star Trek. Therefore they are making their own production crew which happens to include some of the original people, but not all of them.

Don't you remember that all of the sets and costumes and props from Star Trek were sold off to millionaires in the early 2000's? And that was the one thing about Star Trek, they had warehouses full of ships, phasers, costumes, the Borg Queen's costume, Worf's head make up, Data's emotion chip, even Geordi's visors. The prop for Jupiter station which was actually three trashcan lids. And the thing about Star Trek is that they used those props and sets over and over again. But after that auction, it's all gone now. And the people who created those things? I can name many of those people, and they are no longer working for Paramount. Some of them actually worked on ""Star Trek Continues"", and that was even a fan film series.

So now, they couldn't even create a 90s style Star Trek show if they wanted to- all of the props are gone all of the costumes are gone and all of the ships are gone. But they are doing the best they can, It's a new production crew for a new owner, just be happy they have some of the original people working in the background to create storyline continuity. And if you really watch these first two episodes, and I just watched them together again a couple of days ago- if you view it as one episode you will see how there is an internal trek continuity to all of it. The only problem with it? It looks different. But all of the techno jargon is Trek-correct, and all of the noises on the bridge, and the transporter sound, the communicator ""chirp"", are the same noises that they have always used.

And when you think even more about it, it a costs a hell of a lot of money to create episodes for these shows. That's why shows only have 10 episodes per season these days, because it cost a lot of money to do the production. So sometimes they have to sell streaming memberships to cover it because advertising doesn't cover all of the costs. Not like it used to. Because things cost more these days, because studio rents are higher, because services cost more. So I am willing to put back into the networks that I watch.

I would like to say, ""don't worry, after a year they will probably start syndicating some of these episodes on channels like Spike"", but it hasn't happened yet. But it will.

So it doesn't look like TOS, Next Generation or Deep Space nine anymore, boo-hoo? Well if you go back in time to the 90s in the late 80s you will probably remember that people were complaining how the next generation didn't look to like the original series or that DS9 got into a huge dominion war that lasted about four years. That look that they produced in the late 80s and early 90s, that will never happen again unless they do it as a fan film. In fact, they did. Watch the first episode of Star Trek Renegades. If you want to make a Star Trek that looks like the 90s Star Trek shows, do it yourself, fund it yourself, direct it yourself, and write it yourself. Stranger things have happened. Maybe CBS will even allow you to do it, they certainly allowed ""Star Trek Continues"" to finish their entire series. When Paramount owned Star Trek they actually encouraged the fan films and that is the sad thing here.

But this is not a fan film, this is a new series which takes elements from the original series, the 90s series, Enterprise even, and even aspects from the Kelvin timeline movies. I personally like it because there isn't anything about Star Trek that I don't like. But that's just me. Try to do something for me will you? Don't jump onto your computer to complain about these episodes, jump onto your computer if you really liked the episodes. Because we have heard every aspect of every negative review for the show and for every episode of the show, we've heard it already before, all of it, about the original series, about TNG, about DS9, and the rest of the shows and all of the movies old and new. It's just the same old complaint, complaints made by people who don't like what Star Trek represents and that says more about them than it says about the shows. Star Trek has always supported progressive ideals, because that's what the future is supposed to be about. The future is not supposed to be about going backwards, it's supposed to be about going forwards. And that's what this show is about, a more hopeful future for not just humanity but every individual member of humanity. That is what it has always been about. And if that sounds too progressive or liberal for you, then you never were a fan of Star Trek in the first place.",2 February 2019
"I enjoyed seasons 1 and 2. I like it less with every new episode since. The acting is all over. Ridged, overplayed and just laughable at times. Oddly enough the only laughs I have had watching this entire series so far was laughing at the bad lines and their execution. I love every live action Star Trek show except this one. I don't see myself rewatching this one. Not sure if I'll keep watching it and praying it will get better.",25 February 2022
"I am a fan of the original and basically everything else that followed. I grew up with Next Generation and Capt Picard. I was an adult before I saw the original show although I did see the original movies as a kid as my step father loved Star Trek. I loved all of it, still do. That said, yes this went a different route by having a continuous story line as well as a lot more drama and emotional journeys tied in. I like it personally, I like the direction they have gone. I do like the characters, and have my favorites. One of them being Commander Jett Reno, definitely one of my favorite personalities on the show. I do miss the characters that are no longer with us, but the loss of them as well as a lot of the drama gives the show a more realistic feel for me. As opposed to the older shows where almost no one ever died and somehow everyone always made it out of any situation. This has a much heavier feel to it. Not light hearted and simple, but a good show. Certain characters do get on my nerves at times, but no one should be perfect even on TV. I look forward to seeing where things go in season 4!",18 February 2021
"Updated after re-watching every episode again of all 4 seasons...

Seasons 1 and 2 are the most ""interesting"" Star Trek TV series due to crazy plots, acting, and characters. If you are a sci-fi fan, they are definitely recommended. Sonequa Martin-Green was fine as one major character amongst a strong cast.

Season 3 going forward...what happened? There was easily many episodes with multiple long feelings discussions consecutively about ordinary day to day occurrences like being afraid, not fitting in, a love interest, etc. What happened to having strong characters with occasionally funny and witty repartee?

When did a starship captain turn into a psychiatrist? What happened to Burnham's half Vulcan side, did it turn into a 24/7 robot that complimented the whole crew whenever they did their jobs?

It seems that the producers of STD decided to go all touchy-feely as an antidote to our country's politically driven hate. For the last two seasons, they might as well name this Star Trek for Women.

Get back to story telling with interesting characters and plots with action and entertainment values rather than social engineering with the Good Ship Lollipop that would fit at home on the Hallmark Channel.",25 February 2022
"I was surprised to see the overall rating for this series at 7 out of 10. I genuinely can't fathom how anyone could watch this series and rationally rate it above a 3. And scrolling through the actual reviews it's become very obvious to me that the reviews are an accurate take on the quality of this series as opposed to the rating, which has obviously been propped up by the network. This show is unwatchable. As a Star Trek fan I've tried multiple times to give it a go and just can't get past the first season. So I guess season 2 to 4 could be much better than I expect, but again having read the reviews, which are people who have taken to time to articulate why they don't like it as opposed to just hitting a rating button, confirms my suspicion that the subsequent seasons are just as bad as the first if not worse. So my review is this...don't waste your time. This is a vanity project for social causes and not entertainment by any definition of the word.",27 September 2022
"Star Trek Original Series is quite so famous, but let's be honest, a few years have been passing and only the elder who felt the vibe on TV still know what it's like. Hard to imagine someone new to Star Trek today could feel the same way, since so much has improved in quality of film-making mainly the FX. From today's viewpoint the FX are quite amusing sometimes just gimmicks, the screenplay sometimes feels just let's say plain and well. It aged, but the spirit never does. So we followed Star Trek through its successors and every one of them had it's ups and downs but none of them was quite on par with the Original Series. My apologies, Captain Picard. Star Trek: Discovery in fact just amazed me. The first season gains momentum like a wild ride on a roller coaster, intertwined, fast, dramatic. Also screenplay pays much more attention to today's standards while not reaching out too far. Also it gives so much credits to its spiritual predecessor. Though Season 2 started a bit slower, but yep, that is the way to go, Star Trek. Very good continuation which bears the spirit of the original series.",2 March 2019
"...and they cancelled Enterprise to give us this ???

Okay, the cancelling of Enterprise had nothing to do with the starting of Discovery, but I was sad when they cancelled Enterprise.

STD, oh my, I just saw that, STD! Well, like the rest of the network's understanding of Trekkies, there obviously wasn't much research.

In fairness I have only watched Ep1. and I will watch a few more before I make a final decision, but I was not impressed. Too much big effects (CGI) and not enough meat. I grant that crews have always needed a season or 2 to come together, so i am not bothered by the acting, it will come. That being said, Jolene Blalock had T'Pol down pat from the first episode. If you are going to do Star Trek you have to have a believable Vulcan character right out of the gate.

The other thing you need out of the gate is a moral dilemma, where was that? To shoot or not to shoot, is that the question? Not much depth there, and very little development. In contrast, The Orville, which is supposed to be a Star Trek Spoof, explored gender reassignment surgery by Ep3.

Why did we need new races right out of the gate? Why do Klingons have to look different...again! Do the writers not remember that there was much discussion and justification when Micheal Dorn's Worf came onto the scene?

There is a reason Star Trek has endured for 5 decades...yes more than 50 years! And I have been alive for all of them. The producers of this show better figure it out fast. Trekkies don't want a Shonda Rhimes soap opera or even a George Lucas shoot-'em-up adventure, though we may watch those, that is not why we watch Star Trek.

To the producers -- you have been handed the Holy Grail, don't p**s in it.",25 September 2017
"It's a shame that this new series of Star Trek, with its epic special effects and massive production budget, is just not very good. It's disappointing. The arching plot is boring and chaotic. It's just a shame, a crying shame.

I'm a huge Star Trek fan and have been watching and rewatching Star Trek for over 20 years. I can barely stand to watch one episode of discovery. I guarantee I won't be rewatching discovery 20 years from now like I do TNG, Voy, DS9, and even ENT! I can't wait until Discovery ends it's run and we can get back to good Trek.",7 December 2021
"The season start was nothing short of jaw-dropping, and not in a good way. First off they've made the proudest race in the whole ST universe, Klingons, look like a mismatch between the Alien-creature and the Elephant man and their language reduced to something you'd hear from a slow speaking muppet with something stuck in their throat. I was outraged by this alone. Then it got this whole liberal touchy-feely bullshit all throughout as well, what's next? Gender politics in space? Secondly, the CGI was the absolute worst I've seen for 2017. Even Babylon 5 was better, and that was 20 years ago made on Amiga. I felt like I was watching someone play some space-game on a console (because you don't get this level of s*** on computers) and they even dared to change the iconic colours of federation guns and torpedoes.

I reckon this series will not survive season one, though they might push two seasons to not lose face. It's a show made for the millennials and those only, and still many of them reject it. This has absolutely nothing to do with Star Trek, it's tantamount to treason to even suggest it. Even if this had been a different show with a different name, it could never have competed with even Canada-based sci-fi shows.

Thirdly, story. There is none, and the characters are so stale it felt like watching stage-acting. Even Enterprise shone brightly compared to this.

Shame on the people who created this crap, but what goes around comes around and it will most certainly hit them in the rear at one point.",26 September 2017
"All politicking about streaming services or not aside, this was beautiful. Just beautiful. Thoroughly engaging characters - full blooded performances and direction. And the design. Oh. The DESIGN. The Klingons have NEVER looked better. The Klingon make up, costumes and ship interiors are like HR Giger and Tarsem Singh had a high Renaissance baby. People are saying this follows the JJ Abramsverse (which I don't really care for) but I disagree (although I did spot the occasional lens flare). This feels more weighty and substantial by comparison to those films. Discovery is steeped in Trek lore and hearkens back to the original Trek, not so much the series, but more to Nicolas Meyer's two films - II and VI - which, for my money, are the best of the bunch. Meyer, who is credited as consulting producer, has his finger print all over this - but still, Discovery is also very much its own.

So far I've seen the first two - I can't wait for the third.",25 September 2017
"I've watched two episodes and the worst thing I can about it is the Klingons remind to much of the Xindi. I think it's well made, paced and it looks like the main characters will be likable. There is a little lack of humour but that may come with time and that's made up so far by the good plot and cgi. It looks great too. A great improvement on the po faced Enterprise which started out badly with that awful theme song and just got worse from there. I've given it an 8 for now, but that could get well get higher if it keeps up with the standard so far.",24 October 2017
"So many negative reviews out there... After a pilot episode(s)? Come on..... Special effects... awesome. Klingons.... awesome. Acting.... awesome. Music.... awesome.

Death, a believable non-'messiah complex' story, good perspective from both Klingon Empire and Federation point of view, and dynamic action. The things that you usually do not expect from a Star Trek series, but they were there.

These two pilot episode had more moral dilemmas, and checked more gender equality boxes than an entire season of the TNG.

That said, I hope it will not become a war TV series, and that we will witness more Science than Fiction. Hopefully, there also will be some exploration in between exploding Federation and Klingon starships.",25 September 2017
"I consider myself a BIG Trekkie. I have been watching Start Trek since 2011, when I was in my 1st year as a student in College, and ever since I have watched every piece of Star Trek which was ever filmed, and I can tell you this:

Do not listen to people being critical with the new Star Trek movies, or this show. People do not like change, and most people like to see themselves as cinematography ""experts"", when they have no expertise whatsoever.

As a HUGE Trekkie fan, I can tell you I love the new Star Trek movies, and I surely love what I have read about the new cast of Discovery. :)

It was the same when Star Trek Next Generation came, which technically broke the original philosophy of Star Trek, from the Kirk Era. This show had the same impact in regards with Race/Religion depiction as it has with this new series. There is no exaggeration whatsoever, the show simply aims for it's sole purpose: A world where there is no discrimination of any form.

People are just idiots, and SUCH people are the ones that are REALLY ruining this show, not the show per-se. I am sick and tired of such people that consider themselves Trekkies, but have NO IDEA OF WHAT STAR TREK IS ALL ABOUT.

Please watch this show, and don't listen to butt-hurt idiots. They are not true fans, they never were and never will be. Their opinion is irrelevant and should be absolutely ignored. Anyone who has a problem with inclusion, differences in gender/race, is totally not a Star Trek Fan.

Also people are arguing about the fact that they are using so much CGI, that they are changing the Klingons...THEY HAVE ALWAYS DONE THAT! IT IS A PROGRESSIVE SHOW! THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RELEVANT TO PRESENT TIMES!

The show changes, as it had in the past and that is why Star Trek is such a great show. It was always relevant to the times it was shot.",23 September 2017
"Honestly, I love Star Trek. I have been watching The Orville, and constantly have to remind myself that The Orville is not Star Trek. Then I watched the 2 episodes of Star Trek Discovery tonight. Then I realized that The Orville actually is Star Trek, and that Discovery is blasphemy. The fact that Discovery is Prime Universe really pisses me off. The continuity errors are inexcusable. This would be fine if it was JJ Abrams Universe (although it would still be bad), but it's not. The show is so CGI heavy that it is sad. The Orville even looks more Star Trek than Discovery does.

Discovery so far has an awful plot. There is not 1 likable character so far in this show. There is nothing that gets you involved in the show. To add insult to injury, everything is so un-Star Trek like (the look of being in warp, interaction with the computer, viewscreens, etc.).

And then to top it off, is Bryan Fuller. A guy who wrote and produced episodes for DS9 and VOY. For him to have created this abomination considering his background with Star Trek is inexcusable. You know it is sad when a comedy writer (Seth McFarlane) can make a more Star Trek like show then a guy who has actually wrote Star Trek episodes.

"Does she cry and whisper and cry and whisper and cry... Cheesy is too weak a word to describe it. In this series, Sonequa Martin-Green is among the worst actors/actresses I've ever seen. Compared to her, silent movie actors would look restrained. Mary Wiseman is a close second in that race. Well, most actors are awful here (Michelle Yeoh and David Ajala are fine though). There were a few ok moments in seasons 1 and 2 (Michelle Yeoh was fun even). But season 3 is beyond salvation. Couldn't watch it till the end. Your life is worth more than that.",1 March 2021
"Honestly, I don't understand the, ""This is not Star Trek,"" rhetoric that seems to rule this thread like an irritable child. It is. It really obviously is. And it's a lot of fun. I've only watched the first two episodes (obviously, as that's all there is right now) but it's looking pretty good. Give it a try.",25 September 2017
"Let me start off by saying, I have been a Star Trek fan since I can remember. I grew up watching TOS, TNG, DS9 and Voyager. Still do today through Netflix. I even watch and like Enterprise. I have watched and own all the movies. I even still have the VHS boxed copies I had in the 90's. Star Trek is obviously my favorite TV show series of all time.

All that being said, I have really hesitated and delayed my eventual viewing of the newest TV series Discovery. I admit, all the hate surrounding the series really put me off and I just kept putting it off. CBS only having it available to view in the US via their streaming site, was another reason, and in my opinion was a bad business move. Anyway, last week I decided to do the week free trial and just Binge it.

After watching all the episodes of the first season spread into two days, I not only liked it, it surpassed any expectations I may have had. The acting is great, visuals are breathtaking, and the stories are well told and at times unexpected in a good way.

However the biggest question going into this new series, ""is it Star Trek"", ""does it feel like Star Trek"". I am happy to say, YES. Admittedly, the first episode is a bit awkward and it was probably one of the biggest reasons why so many fans were turned off, but as soon as soon as episode 2 and 3, I feel the series takes off into warp. There is obviously an over arching story that eventually comes together spectacularly in the later episodes, but the show also has a couple of the traditional character development episodes mixed with exploration, which is a story telling staple of Star Trek.

The biggest glaring criticism among fans are the Klingon's appearance. Yes, they look very different from previous shows, but in terms of their ""culture"" about honor and the warrior spirit is very much intact. Their appearance did take me aback some in the first episode, but then as you go further into the series, you learn more about the different houses that are introduced. I really do like how there is a more distinct difference between the Klingon families. Also, lets be honest here, Klingon's are the one alien race in Star Trek that has gone through the most inconsistent changes throughout the decades. So yes, the Klingon's look different, but you get used to it.

Don't get me wrong, its not perfect and doesn't come close to the classics. Not yet anyway. Like any first season of any TV show, there are some flaws, especially when it comes to Star Trek. Just look at TNG and DS9. My two favorite Star Trek shows, had very awkward starts, but the shows eventually grew and molded itself to what we love today. I really do hope Discovery is given more of a chance by the fans, and is allowed to continue and mold to something great in the future, just like the others.",20 June 2018
Actually liked season one. Lorca was great. Burnham has sucked since day one. Season 4 is making me vomit. Everything that is wrong with this is growing and what made it good is all but gone. Saw a review that this is trek for Lifetime and that couldn't be more spot on. Burnham has been in love with the sound of her own voice and trying to force emotional depth by blabbering on forever when she should be taking immediate action and the number of characters that have jumped on that bandwagon keeps increasing to the point where S4E2 had about 5 minutes of plot and the rest was sob story drivel. I'm not opposed to a good speech. Picard has made some inspiring ones. Everything in discovery just make me wish they'd shut the hell up.,1 December 2021
"Yes, Gene Roddenberry is probably rolling over in his grave, I never met him and my hope is that someday he will come from beyond the grave to pull the feet of these ""screenwriters"".

There is no love for Gene Roddenberry's saga here. And I doubt this series is for lovers of the original Star Trek, TNG, DS9, Voyager and Enterprise.

It is unbearable to have to watch the ""romance"" between 2 beings that dream of reproducing by mitosis, and with characters that start as something and become something else (as if it were Transformers); the Ferengis are more bearable than everything they have forced as protagonists so far.

I don't want to imagine the amount of crap they're going to try to put in Picard or Strange New World, but if it's anything like this I can say my time will be more productive without having to invest it in this and the following series.

I just stopped paying for NF because of this garbage woke. Sure, someone is funding for filming this advertising woke, but I don't plan to ever contribute a dime to this stupidity and I hope they soon cancel this series.

"So many negative reviews here about 'legacy', 'lens-flares', or 'canon'...

Judge for yourself.

""Discovery"" is exactly what it's supposed to be - a modern Star Trek series. And it's pretty freaking great. Fantastic production, intriguing storyline, new characters that are thematically conflicted - in a context that modern audiences can understand.

If I had a complaint, it's that the characters' thinking is what you'd expect from characters in a sequel to the TNG universe, not a prequel. While we completely understand it as an audience, it makes less sense when you back up and think about the timeline.

Other than that, this is a great series thus far. There's only so much fake-leaning-from-a-direct-hit we can watch... Give ""Discovery"" a shot. If you aren't a high-nosed Star Trek snob, you're likely to love it. And see it on Blu-Ray if you can, they put some cash into the effects - and it shows. Well worth it.",28 December 2018
"I haven't watched the older star trek series because they never enticed me in any way. I am however a major Sci-Fi fan in all regards and to that end, without any pre-conceived notions as to what the characters should look like (the klingons look badass) and that there are females in command (like how can someone seriously write a negative review about that?) the first two episodes were really good.

It's not game of thrones level in writing, budget or effects as is to be expected, but for a sci-fi it's very good and what the genré needs to catch the eye of the general public.

"I've watched and enjoyed, for the most part, most previous Star Trek voyages, in their myriad forms. However, I've never had a poster on my wall, been to a convention, or bought a single piece of memorabilia. So, neither a hater nor a fanboy.

I get a lot of the negativity from lifelong fans around S1. For me, principally, it was the migration from a new adventure every week - a planet with a new lifeform, a new problem, a particular puzzle that Kirk, Picard, Janeaway, whoever, would bring a humane and unique solution to, all the while revealing aspects of their personality too, furthering the bonds between the crew - to a soap opera, the core storyline overriding the exploration and adventure.

Given that, I wasn't excited for S2. But it has blown me away. So far, up to S2E12, the character development, their backgrounds, relationships, the storyline, the all-powerful Borg-eque foe... Everything is clicking.

But, it appears Discovery will continue to be a soap opera. The episodic into the unknown isn't what this show is. If you can hurdle that barrier there's a damn fine show on the other side. Currently my most anticipated on a weekly basis.",5 April 2019
"Listen Star Trek creators, because we know you're reading these comments: 1. Get better writers. Look at HBO shows. Get writers with experience, complexity, lightheartedness, who can write good dialouge, who can make real stakes, and don't change canon.

2. Ease up with the pitch dark shadowy lighting. It's tiresome and unpleasant to look at.

3. Address the Michael Burnham whisper cry faux sincere thing.

4. Make it episodic. Standalone episodes

5. Don't go overboard on fan service. Make it organic. You know how when a kid learns a word because they just heard it from the kids in the playground? And they repeat it in the oddest ways and poorly times ways? Don't do that. The Easter eggs can be throwaway. Don't give Cheewie a medal if you know what I mean.

6. Stop trying to be dark, heavy, and serious. Nobody wants flatulence jokes nor swearing (why? Picard I'm looking at you too)

7. Make Michael not be dramatic...IN LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE SCENE. A bit of fun, joy. None of the characters feel like they live and work with each other. It feels like dress up. I'm not sure why but it FEELS like they all just came in that morning. Almost all of the other shows you feel like they live there. Maybe more light scenes in 10 forward. Maybe have them play tennis together? Poker? Anything? It doesn't feel like everything needs to be a crisis. Are there any just downtime scenes?

8. Make Michael STOP CRYING. Have you ever been at a military academy or fire station or any group that serves and explores? People ain't hugging and crying and saying ""we're a family"" ""I believe in you."" This is rubbish writing. It feels like CW written for 14 year olds. Please stop doing that.

9. Diversity and Inclusion is important but make it organic. Ellen Ripley was a strong compelling character. Not just a woman. She was feminine but it wasn't the beginning and end of all she was. Writers today who have read a few books think shoving identity at the screen makes good writing. It does not. Write great characters, great stories and great dialouge.

10. Again. Make the show's lighting and art direction visually brighter. BRIGHTEN THE LIGHTING.

11. BRIGHTEN THE SETS.

12. STOP THE UPSIDE DOWN CAMERA THING. What are you trying to do? Music videos? So unnecessary. Just focus on telling good stories.",29 November 2021
"Some of you are hell bent on the old style of Star Trek not giving the new one a chance, This only makes you immature and childish. People that can not accept change are the same people that oppressed African Americans and the rest is a history Lesson. Obviously there are major changes to the Klingons and I love it, They are still Klingons but smarter, less terrorising and more tactile which for some would argue is misinformation but you have to ask; ""How did they acquire and engineered all that technology and maintain the cro magnon way?"" So one thing is to try and make sense of an advance civilization that has been flying amongst the stars before humanity did. ""Silly rabbit tricks are for kids"" The story line and the plot is super amazing and it is meant for a movie screen but the story is too long to make it into one movie. The actors are fantastic! great job! great cast and what a fantastic background, Costume, engineers, All the crew that worked on this should be commended on a job well done. Finally I wanted the mention how this series took my emotions up and down with frustration and anticipation. The episodes would not drag on but left me with more question until one day we end up in another universe and loosing my favorite doctor, I was heart crushed but then the next week opened up what the actual intention of this tv plot was from the very beginning. I stand up and applaud again on a great story plot line and the ending left me in tears, Enterprise. One last thing is about discovery, I have a hunch that discovery was created in that alternate universe and some how was built in ours. Even if it wasn't then obviously that technology came from somewhere non human or the future. With that said then where is the Time Travel Police?

"I started my own Star Trek journey at age 10, in 1966, when I watched the premier of a show that blew my mind and changed my little world. I have been a fan ever since, and I will be 64 this year. I have watched every show and every movie, with the exception of Discovery. When it first aired I got to about the half way point of episode 2. Then, I just wasn't interested enough to watch more. With the advent of Picard, I find I so anticipate the next episode that I am looking for more Star Trek to appease my appetite. So I decided to give Discovery another go. It's just wrong on so many levels. It got a couple of things right, but it's not enough. Why set it 50 years per Original Series? We had a great prequel in Enterprise already. People want to know where things went later, not where they were earlier. And if you're going to do 50 years before Kirk and Spock - you can't have tech that didn't exist. I have read a lot of reviews here, and a lot of them hit it on the head. Of course there are some that complain it's too PC - which I think is BS. Star Trek could never be any such thing - it's a ridiculous complaint about any show, and when I see anyone say that they lose all credibility in my view. Okay, 4 yrs have passed since my review. I decided to give it another shot. Many people said start at season 2, so I did. Wow. Totally changed my view. And with season 3 it's no longer a prequel. My mind has been changed. A very respectable addition to the Star Trek offerings. In spite of this, Michael Burnham's whispering drives me crazy! Speak woman! P. S. The best thing to happen to season 3 is David Ajala. He's awesome!!!!!

NOV 2021 Update. Two episodes into season 4 and I had to stop watching. Sonequa Martin-Green's whispering is so distracting and annoying I can't watch it.",22 March 2020
"Binged the first two seasons due to the pandemic and I needed a break from everything else. Loved season one, two was meh, then I couldn't even finish season 3. SMG is a great actress, but I'm tired of ""The Michael Burnham?!!"" Gets old after a while. Long story short, avoid after season 2.",2 April 2022
"When they announced they were bringing back startrek I was overwhelmed with emotion, TNG/DS9 were my all time favorite shows growing up and I felt in our dark age and time the enlightenment represented by startrek would be uplifting...

Unfortunately what we got wasn't startrek, it was some kind of generic sci-fi with really good special effects but absolutely without a soul.

There is so much bad in this show it would take a Thesis to even begin to cover it from cliche plots,bad writing and the inability to retain any degree of canon.

Starting off in the ToS you would think they knew that Replicators didn't exist and the design of the ship was closer to a nuclear sub, streamlined and disciplined.

Not these clowns who stumbled through the show, none of them show any sign of training or discipline and act more like tiktok teens transported to what is supposed to be the future.

There was some intriguing elements early on like with Lorca and Ash tyler even if it wasn't startrek so much as Battlestar Galactica but it helped me put up with the absolute crew of morons lead by the now captain burnham who is a insufferable marysue that the world revolves around and lands on her feet despite dragging everything down around her.

Season by season the 'good' elements stripped away leaving the show a barren waste, a mockery of startrek that should be cancelled.",15 August 2022
"Tremendous technically, strong writing, Season 2 is better. MAGA hat people will hate it and give it 0s and 1s, but 70% of us will enjoy it. All the 1 ratings smell like misogyny and racism. Better minds will enjoy it.",11 February 2019
"I made it through season 1, but really was disappointed. The show wasn't cancelled though. But I didn't watch the second season because of my distaste after the first one, even though there were a few aspects of it I really liked. A friend of mine watched Season 2 and told me it was great and to give it a shot. I am so glad I did. I'm only half way though the second series and I am loving it. The themes being explored in season 2 are captivating and fascinating as Spock would say. More of the characters are being developed which are really interesting, new species, new hybrids, new dynamic interfaces. I may someday subject myself to the first season again, but right now I'm happy to leave it behind and get to Discovery discovering things where no one has gone before, both in inner territories, including the shadow, and externally in the many mysteries the universe has to challenge our preconceptions and open us to new vistas. So hooraay for the resurrection of Discovery!",18 May 2020
"Seriously, can they talk normally and whisper all the time !!!

This is becoming so annoying .. and the problem is that all the lead actors do it :( ............................ Just filling the 150 characters ........",25 February 2022
"I grew up on Star Trek ToS as my mum was a huge fan, but it was Star Trek: The Motion Picture, which I saw first aged about 8, that had me hooked. The beautiful visuals and the deeply emotional storytelling was something else. A sci-fi opera epic that concentrated on what it means to be human and to have human relationships. Then came Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan, which is clearly just amazing and has many great quotable lines (if a movie makes you want to quote it, it usually means it's got something right). After that high-point came a bunch of sequels which were hit-and-miss, (or rather miss-hit-miss-hit), but the characters still carried the series.

As the films soldiered on, The Next Generation launched. I have to admit, I didn't buy into it. The overly-shiny ships, the designed-by-committee characters, the often-hammy staginess of the acting - it never felt real to me. I went from a huge Trek fan to a casual observer. Just when I'd stopped caring altogether, along came the reboot movies. Lightweight, yes, but at least the characters felt real and the path was paved to a possible return on our TV screens. And now we have Star Trek: Discovery.

I enjoyed the first series of Discovery but wasn't quite sure which way the series was heading. Great moments were interspersed with the shadows of TNG-era TV-making. Although it was aiming for Golden Age of TV status with a Grown Up attitude, it occasionally came off as a bit twee. The Season 1 after-show exemplified the Trek love-in attitude that had eventually borged the TNG era. Discovery felt as though it was held back a little by its fanboy / fangirl awareness. Anyway, overall it was a success for me; not the best Sci Fi show out there (which is the outstanding The Expanse) but by no means the worst.

Series 2 brought in some new characters and a whole host of character development. It also began to move away from the vague sense that the show was being run on behalf of the Trekkers, and the show started to move back towards the original ToS in its attitude. In the ToS, and especially the movies, it was the believable human relationships that carried the viewer along. Kirk-Spock-McCoy and crew - their deep affection for each other, to the point of not being complete as individuals without their bonds of friendship (""sometimes the needs of the one out weigh the needs of the many"") - made Star Trek what it is today. The relationship between Burnham and Spock is unlike any we've seen in Trek since the original trio left our screens. Their words are heartfelt and touching, their relationship actually matters to the way the characters behave, and, like with the ToS films, the high emotion just stayed on the right side of being mawkish.

Now, obviously there will be a degree of hate. Many Trek fans grew up under the TNG regime and have a different understanding of what Trek is. Also, there will be the usual ""it's been destroyed by PC nonsense"" cry, which is ironic as ToS was very PC for its time, as was TNG. As an aside, younger viewers watching ToS will have seen plenty of regressive attitudes - women marginalised and treated largely as pretty distractions whilst the men got on with the important business of saving the ship - but with the first mixed-race kiss on US TV and its left-leaning political philosophy, ToS was very progressive. Anyway, in my mind Discovery has evolved into a prime example of where Star Trek has got it right. Trek was always intended to be a mirror to society, reflecting what current society is doing wrong and improving on those weaknesses, and Discovery does that well. The excellent final episode fight scene between the bad-guy, the ultimate patriarchal allegorical figure, and two main female characters is preceded by a very pointed ""women, stop talking"" line.

So 9/10. Not quite 10/10 as the action does sometimes feel a bit detached and the show finished Season 2 with a rather forced line of reasoning to smooth the join between new and old Trek lore, but that was unavoidable given the context of the new series. But other than those two problems, a very well made series that extols the values of human emotion and human relationships.",20 April 2019
"This show should stop calling itself Star Trek because it isnt.

If you take it as an orville-like action sci fi shoe it is above mediocre. But if you brand it as Star Trek; it is by far the worst...

The characters dont adhere to the federation rules nor its ideologies. Sending the ship to the future made sense because they became a super crew with the most powerful computer and ship ever. At least they cant mess with the timeline anymore. Everyone we know is a commander now which makes no sense. So it is what it is. A good old stupid action adventure sci fi show with good production and effects. Just drop the name star trek.",13 May 2022
"The CGI-department did a good job. The production is pro. The rest ranges from bad to mediocre. There is no introduction to the characters and I gotta tell I can't relate much to them and therefore I don't care for them at all. Also imo the leading duo is the most uninteresting of all ST shows - I don't sense any chemistry between those characters at all, but maybe the writers will surprise us with a lesbian relationship ;)

Funny is the ""the new look"" of the Klingons, I really didn't recognize them till I read Klingon in the subtitle :D

I guess this show will have the same issues as many modern productions - the technical stuff (camera, CGI, setting, production) is pro but the storytelling is incoherent, bad constructed, badly timed and boring. It seems to me that the one department that really did get worse is the profession of script-writers, but maybe too many production companies need new material and you have to employ whoever you get and knows how to use a notebook and know basic grammar structures.

If you wanna watch a video game, this show will provide. If you want an interesting story this show will not provide. Also, the choice of not sticking to the one episode = one-story structure is imo a bad one. My anti-fake rate because of all those fake 10s is 1, my ""real"" rate would be 4 or maybe 5.

Final words: I won't waste my time with this show - no matter if I wanna see a ST show or just any sci-fi show, and if I need my dose of ST I will rewatch Kirk and Spock or I will rewatch Next Generation or Voyager, or - The Orville!

So those hired guns (social media influencers) call us fanboys, racist and whatever - everybody just check those accounts, all new, all fake - how disgraceful of the responsible people for the ""new"" Star Trek which is just an old typical sci-fi-opera with the looks of a video game. What's new in that show, just hell knows ;)",24 September 2017
"The first episode ""blah"" at best. The second episode was better, but I was about to ride off this series. Then episode 3 came out. Boy, something changed. I can see the direction this show is going and its going to be awesome. Gritty, dark, and funny.

This series will be like nothing else. Some will not like this style but I think most will. If you're a Trekkie, then give it a chance.",3 October 2017
"If Gene Roddenberry would still be alive, i guess he would kick his son´s butt for beeing involved with this CGI overloaded piece of crap. Where is the Star Trek spirit? WHERE?",23 January 2018
"So, we are in season 4.

Every season have had it's story arc and in this one, it's the feelings. There is some cosmic thingy flying around and destroying planets, strange civilisation, ""going where no man has gone before"" stuff... But none of this is to important.

Feelings.

Every single character needs dr Phil in one scene and IS dr Phil in the next one. We're happy, I'm sad, they are scared, he's insecure, she's melancholic, I'm depressed, she's thrilled, he's angry, they are in love... And this goes on for about 80% of each episode. Even the finale of this season is resolved by feelings!!!

COME ON!

After all of those counseling sessions, there was not much time left for some actual Star Trek. Only Michalel Burnham is Jesus, Wonder Woman and Ghandi all-in-one character development. Again.

This can't get any worse.

This time for real, becouse I said the same thing for season 3.",20 March 2022

"My critique refers mainly to season 3.

As a Start Trek fan for several decades, it hurts me to write this: But please scale back the emotions or I'll quit!

Character development is fine, and I'm a socially very progressive man and therefore I don't mind at all a majority female and LGBTQ crew, but this constant crying and whining, and the need for hugging, and the self-doubting, and the need to encourage crew members simply to do their job - it drives me crazy! Cry-babies in space - that's not Star Trek, at least not the Star Trek I'm interested in.",20 January 2021
Don't bother yourself and care about whiners cry-me-a-river bad reviews about show and how it is disappointing. Those are hard core star-trek fans who still admire and worship first episodes of Cpt. Kirk from '70 and hate everything else.Discovery has strong beginning and it is really enjoyable to watch. It has strong premise and it is focused on pre Kirk era with another crew instead ol' ka'p'n Kirk and Spock.,25 September 2017
"I have never been a die hard fan of Star Trek i recently bough the remastered blue ray version of the older movies from 1979 to 2002.

I must say they where all pretty boring lots of dialogue lack of action too much drama.

Star Trek Discovery took a risk they is tone of action, amazing special effects for a tv series, and a lot more cool things. But there is not the magic of what the old star trek had.

The new star trek movies from 2009 til today i found to be amazing too they took a turn to more action less boring dialogue etc.

I guess it all comes down to what people want to watch to each is own i guess i enjoyed the new star wars movies as well so i guess my main focus in life is not to complain like so many do",30 January 2018
"Honestly, not only does this show have a massive problem with storytelling (started horribly in Season 1 and finished unbearably in Season 3), but it's the following actors who suck and they are unfortunately too many to save the show. (And afterwards the actors who do a great job!)

THUMBS DOWN FOR THE FOLLOWING ACTORS:

1. Sonequa Martin-Green as Michael Burnham is a drama queen and cries way too much. She is far too intense and overacts in situations where a relaxed smile would have been better. After 2 seasons it's clear that she isn't up to the lead character of Star Trek Discovery. Her role as the main character should be more subtle and there isn't any chemistry when she interacts with the other crew members/actors. It seems forced. She's the show's main problem because the crew revolves around her, but she's not likeable, a Mary Sue and hasn't managed to earn respect and gain any real authority over the last two seasons. It's hard to say it that clear but the failing of Star Trek Discovery is due to Sonequa Martin-Greens bad acting performance as the lead and also her incapacity to step back and let other actors and characters shine.

2. Mary Wiseman as Tilly just isn't believable as an ensign. It is very hard to accept that in this position on a spaceship you are so confused and unfocused. Her acting is mediocre which makes it even worse.

3. Anthony Rapp as Paul Stamets is painful to look at - he's boring and his facial expressions are almost always the same: worried and compassionate.

4. Wilson Cruz as Dr. Hugh Culber is the most boring and uninteresting doctor in Star Trek history. Where are the rough edges, where is the personality? Drinking a glass of milk is more fun than watching him!

HERE THE ACTORS WHO DO/DID A GREAT JOB:

1. Doug Jones as Saru is an interesting character and plays his role absolutely believable. He is perfect! And he is a fine captain!

2. David Ajala as Book is funny, cool, easy going with his own agenda. Cool character played very well!

3. Jane Brook as Admiral Cornwell was very convincing in her role!

4. Jason Isaac was fantastic as Lorca!

5. Michelle Yeoh as Philippa is a great villain!

6. Anson Mount as Captain Pike - he should have been the lead character in Star Trek Discovery! Loved his nuanced acting. And he gave the whole series some lightness and a spark of humor.",1 November 2020
"Ouf! What more can be said. After 10 minutes I wanted it to end. Why? No emotional attachments to the characters. Captain Georgiou (Michelle Yeoh) who is difficult to understand, Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) who speaks as fast as a laser being fired. What is she, an android? A Stephen Hawkins' offspring who knows more than Stephen Hawkins himself. What about the moral that is supposed to be transmitted! ''It's a mutiny'' Good grief if not Pathetic. And what about the Klingons? OK, a good show for those who learn the Klingon language. Sad for a debut. Why wasn't the cast of the Star Trek Into Darkness chosen? Yes CaptainGeorgiou, laser to oblivion Number One. No big loss.Time to have someone else. A series that is beginning that is so distant from the viewer at all level that it is safe to say:to distance itself from its public, to go Where no TV shows have gone before.

Part 2- One week has passed by and I finally resolved myself to watch, after the 6th rerun, the last 40 minutes of the second episode of Star Trek Discovery after having been disillusioned after the first ten 10 minutes of episode one and then being insulted by episode 2.

The question I asked myself after the second episode was: Are we still in the STar Trek philosophy or are we in something new?

Indeeed, Stark Trek Disovery is bringing the series to a new paradigm that will obliterate the humanistic view of the exploration of space too that of warfare. And, is this not in link to our current society?

When Georgiou (Michelle Yeoh) is killed at the end of the second episode and had said to Michael Burns that after serving 7 years with her, she, Burns, still had a flaw in her humanity and was not yet fit to command a star ship, and when Anderson (Terry Serpico) Admiral of a star ship meets his death when a Klingon cloaked vessel smashes into his star ship after he negotiated a cease fire with the Klingons in order to discuss peace, and when Enseign Connor (Sam Vartholomos) is sent to sick bay to heal his burns and instead encounters Michael Burnahm (Sonequa Martin-Green) to say to her that what they were going through was not about space exploration and discovery but war then is killed in an explosion, he mentions if war was Star Fleet's philosophy.

What the 3 have in their comments and attitude is the remains of the Star Trek philosophy and humanism. With their deaths seals the original Star Trek view of space exploration and meaning

Probably the series will have the viewers assist to the transformation of Michael Burns where her humanity will develop and have her bring back the Starfleet philosophy of what space exploration and discovery means. But in the meantime, I believe we will assist to a lot of war and the beautiful toys of warfare equipment.

I would go further by saying Star Trek Discovery and, just the word Dicovery, means the self discovery that Michael Burnham will go through in the war process. Or,probably the discovery of war as a way of life.

Part 3-Update

After watching the first 6 episodes I asked myself was I right to think the way I have.

There are three things now to consider.

First of all, why call it Star Trek?

Wouldn't it have been more simple to give it its own direction? Its own title, its own philosophy? Why Star Trek? Especially that an sentient being , the slug, is finally sent in space to have it survive. This is not Star Trek which is to kill or use life forms for base purposes.

As a fact, one could relate to an episode of Voyager where Janeway (Kate Milgrew) encounters a badly damaged federation vessel using an species for the vessels engines. Janeway fought the idea. True to the Star Trek philosophy.

Secondly, about the lizards.

Probably descendant of the house of Raptors. You know, millions of years ago on planet earth where the dinosaurs roamed the world, I believe a few velociraptor eggs were taken by a forgotten alien species living somewhere in the universe and dropped the eggs on a distant planet to have them evolve as what will become the Klingons.

Let's not even mention the Vulcans.

The Philosophy

Now, this is where it become interesting and why Discovery should have had an orientation of its own.

And, I would add, is this series a harbinger of what will happen to our society? And that is, How far will a country (planet) go to win a war? Think Russia, Korea, China, ISIS.

I believe we have not yet seen everything. If this is Discovery's win the war at all costs philosophy then what lies ahead? It should be beyond imagination.

If there is a fragment of Star Trek in Discovery it would be to show us what the future holds in warfare knowledge and technology even to sacrifice what needs to be sacrificed in order to survive just like the slug.

Scary! Indeed.",24 September 2017
"So far (and still) DS9 is my favorite, and ""The original series"" jointly with ""Voyager"" run up the rear. Next Generation was not bad, as well as Enterprise. So this one had to be somewhere in between, Let's just forget for a moment that other series exist and focus solely on this one. It's well written, has very good direction and sfx and some outstanding acting performances. As a standalone it deserves 8/10. Do not compare or you're lost. People producing this gave their best to compromise between everything we've seen so far (and grew up with) and make something new, yet old. They did a respectable job. Second season is commonly the hardest, since authors have to meet the expectations set out in the first. Let's see where this will take us in next seasons. So far, so good.",24 April 2019
"This series not is Star Trek. Is a Good SkyFi series but not is the real star trek. And a cute series of science fiction, nothing more. It has nothing of the real Star Trek.",26 April 2019
"I was so excited when I heard this is coming out, but it has lost site of everything that Star Trek represents. The characters are boring with the exception of Captain Pike. The plot has completely lost sight of what Gene Roddenberry had intended for his vision. I am hoping this will be canceled and we can all focus on the Picard show.",9 April 2019
"So since the start I never knew where to place Discovery. The CGI great, the cast is great and even the same showrunners we had in the older Star Treks. But always felt that something is missing. That the pace is either to fast or slow, or that the ships character's are at times all just there to fulfil Burnham's inner struggles with herself.

I get why people don't like her, I would think some dislikes are centered around the Vulcan blasphemy making her the sister of Spock. You know the one he never talked about as she didn't exist in space and time when we watched the previous series...

But if you can wrap your head around that then the show actually gets good. Season 3 is by far my favourite, and really has my attention. Also glad that I am not a racist or trans/homophobe to be able to enjoy this fully without having to make snarky comments on here. Cmon people it's STAR TREK! It's meant to unite people, species and lifeforms from different backgrounds as Gene Rodery always intended. I feel this rendition does a great job respectfully.",3 December 2020
"I genuinely loved the first two seasons, they had so much to offer, people are getting upset that it's not like a traditional start trek, but that's the point. Star Trek is great and I know that they obviously tried something new, but just neglecting a show just because it's not like the previous ones before that is stupid, and they're completely neglecting all that it has to offer. The first two seasons weren't bad but after the second one it began to decline rapidly, to the point where I don't even bother trying to defend it. It such a shame of wasted potential to be honest and it took what made the Star Trek great: very likeable characters, amazing spacecraft, and stunning cinematography mixed with explosive and thrilling space combat and then they pushed in cringey friendships between characters that started of, kind of fun but then ended up steering the entire plot of the show, the plot is just senseless and it's a really slow burn show that just gets boring, and the few new characters are stereotypical and it feels like the producers are trying to hard to force us to like them, combat almost never happens and it's alright when it does but it's just don't feel the same. I remember being so exited for the finale of season two (I won't give any spoilers but if you watched it you know what I mean). I admit the cinematography is still there but not as good as it used to be. The story just seems so rushed and it's boring. I watched the first two seasons with my family and we loved them but only after the first four or so episodes of the third season we had to stop because of how bad it was. Honestly, just a disappointment.",28 August 2022
From the first scenes it's apparent. This isn't Star Trek at all but a not even subliminal message for a social agenda...it hits you on the head and in the solar plexus with some kind of social one universe all worlds order message and you better get on board cause it's either that or death by the Klingons. You've got to wonder how this got produced and for who? The brand deserves not just better but wholly different. This is pure rubbish.,28 September 2017

The main characters are never fully flushed out and when they do get a story they kill them off .

"Production levels are high and you can tell they are trying to innovate whilst staying true to the traditions, but the ""science"" they are basing the episodes on is almost childish in its' incredulity. The whole basis of the magical drive is ridiculous and embarrassing, and subsequent episodes have introduce equally nonsensical concepts. This is SCIENCE fiction, not fantasy fiction and we need to have at least one toe of one foot dipping into either proven physics or reasonably sound theory.",13 May 2018
"Season one was okay. Season two was okay. Both seasons kept me interested. The acting was decent, the storylines were good.

THEN, those writers must have all taken a swan dive off a high cliff and died. The lack of any logic in the storyline, from that point forward, was bad enough. But the endless crying, the endless self introspection; it is the endless death of a thousand cuts.

For the writers, do you really think any crew of a ship, whether a star ship or a sea going vessel, has time to cry and wail, and moan about every decision? Did any of you ever serve in the military? Did any of you ever do anything but exist in your safe space at the studio? I doubt it.",28 December 2022
"What exactly just happened? I think I just watched star wars with a new name. I guess if you weren't around for the original star trek you may like something like this disaster. But that would mean you, like the producers and directors, weren't. The whole concept of star trek is lost on them. And the klingons? Did they have to resort to subtitles? I'm really not fond of reading a movie. That's what they make books for. Actually I'm not really a fan of CGI either. Not to mention ""continued next week"" kind of soap operas. And if you watched the second show... yeah. It's ""continued next week"".",26 September 2017
"To those who were discouraged from watching after reading some bad reviews, you might want to ignore those because I suspect a lot of them didn't make it past the 1st episode (like I almost did). If you're a sci-fi fan and you enjoy series about space and aliens I can almost guarantee you'll like it. It might help if you get rid of your expectations of what a Star Trek series should be. If you watch it without those preconceived notions you'll probably enjoy it a lot more.

I've been a huge Trek fan ever since my ex boyfriend made me watch an episode of Star Trek The Next Generation with him. I thought I would hate it but watched anyway and got hooked. After binge watching TNG I moved on to Voyager, Deep Space Nine, and then Enterprise.

After I watched and loved every episode of all the previous Star Trek series, I got excited when I heard they were making a new one. Then I watched the first episode and absolutely hated it. I was so disappointed. The look of it was way too slick. I hated the changes they made to the Klingons. I thought it was unnecessary and pretentious to include such long scenes where the Klingons only spoke in their language. And what I hated the most was the dark atmosphere the writers created to build their version of the Star Trek universe. None of the storylines in previous Star Trek series were that dark.

I came very close to not watching the 2nd episode, but I thought to be fair I'd have to watch at least 3 episodes before I gave up on it. I'm really happy I did because halfway through episode 3 I got drawn into the story. By episode 5 I changed my IMDb rating from a 3 to an 8.

I loved how everything got turned upside down when they used the spore drive. The whole concept of them finding a new way to travel the universe highlighted the cleverness of the writing. The relationship between the doctor and the scientist made them two of my favorite characters, and the twist in the final few episodes of season 1 was totally unexpected.

Good acting, interesting characters, unexpected twists and turns, stunning visuals, decent character development, and big budget feature film type action are the ingredients that make this series compelling to watch. All you have to do is give it a chance.",31 December 2018
"...how all these negative reviews are written by mostly new members with only one review to their profile: Star Trek Discovery. Hmmm.

The show is fantastic, I love all forms of Trek (some more than others) and this doesn't disappoint in any department. It's emotionally substantial and it looks eye-popping. A knowledge of TOS will definitely enhance your enjoyment IMO. And Klingons should always have been this way. Beautiful redesign.",24 January 2018
"So everybody is hating this new installment of Star Trek. I rather liked it. So there are women commanding, so there are many not so white people around. So what? It is very likely that the world will be filled with more colored people than you can imagine in a couple of hundred years. ( Not important but I am rather white). I liked the new 2017 design of the show, the wonderful CGI, the hard changes in the narrative, the weirdness of the Klingons. Of course there are unlikely moments like when the two women are philosophizing about life between the ruins of their ship. Ha, doesn't that always happen in every TV series? Just relax, sit in your chair, have a beer and enjoy the show. Give some credit to the makers of this show (My English is only so-so; thank you for spellcheckers) I rate this show an 8, I wait and hope it will be 9 or more.

"Season 3. What happened!!? The action, the suspense from the former seasons is gone. The villains are slow and everyone is crying and tallking about their feelings. Its a different feel to the whole show, and not in a good way.

I would say they went from 7.5 to a 6 in rating. Get your bleep together.",10 January 2021
"This is the best serialized Star Trek probably ever and the best series since DS9.

BURNHAM will be possibly your second favorite captain behind Kirk (and then Pike will show up) and it's nice to see a series that fleshes out all the supporting characters.

Season 1 is great due to the referenced to previous Star Trek lore and Michelle Yeoh is fantastic. As the series progresses it finds its footing and gets its grove. Evidently it's going to have to follow strange new worlds and stop these self contained season arcs. You can only go to the well so many times.",13 May 2022
"Michael Burnham and Ensign Tilly would have failed out of Star Fleet Academy. Burnham is undisciplined, has crazy mood swings, and emotional outbursts with endless crying! I believe she cries every episode. Ensign Tilly is so overweight she would never had made it over an obstacle course wall! Then there's the darkness of this Federation of Planets. Star Trek is a place you want to live in. I don't want to live in this Star Trek.",23 April 2021
"Star Trek Discovery performed abysmal - EVERYONE who watched only a single episode of this nonsense knows that. The actors, first and foremost Sonequa Martin-Green as Burnham, are crybabies who - to put it mildly - deliver very mediocre to terrible acting performances (except Saru). Scripts are so horrible and free of logic that it is vomit inducing. The only good thing about this whiny kindergarten, which in my opinion shouldn't even call itself Star Trek, are the special effects.

NETFLIX pulled finally the plug. And therefore the streaming provider is all the more likeable to me.

Star Trek Discovery and Picard failed colossally! The reasons are clear to everyone who has any sense whatsoever and hopefully the responsible persons - especially Alex Kurtzman - will not be given again premature praise and a huge budget from Netflix anytime soon.

It's almost admirable how they squeezed so much unprofessionalism into a series. It will certainly be marketed as a soap opera in the future. This amateurish whining and hugging has absolutely NOTHING to do with Star Trek - not to mention the plotholes and Burnham, the most terrible and annoying character in film history.",28 November 2021
"From all of negative reviews, i am excited as visually as story of first two episodes. Its promising TV show that goes whit modern time.

Im pleased that they didn't do show exactly the same as old ones, even if they did, those bad reviewers would still complain.

And don't bother about technology in film, its object of lapsed debate.

Good show.",25 September 2017
"Star Trek is always about the exploration of undiscovered country. Discovery performs admirably towards the goals of Roddenberry. The show takes the journey of storytelling into the contemporary zeitgeist and engages in feats of adventure that prior tv shows were formerly not able to properly explore with CGI and stunts previously in television. The movie franchise was initially to delve into longer story arcs and more action sequences...I'm proud as a life long trekkie to have found this show even after dismissing it unjustly beforehand.

Regarding the casting..I am slightly disappointed by the choice of Michelle yeoh even being a fan of her..she doesn't feel right especially in episode 1 and 2 but makes up for it later. Sonequa Martin-Green is amazing well chosen and hot! Jason Isaacs is stellar and definitely his character makes you question 'what is star fleet?'

The show is about Starfleet in its beginning infancy...bear that in mind.",26 August 2018
"I just felt like saying that. Since all I see are oh so original reviews saying how woke it is. Love Michael Burnham and I love the crew. I hope it goes on and on. You do know Star Trek has always been ""woke"" right? There is plenty of trek out there. If this doesn't fit what you think ""your""trek should be. Shed your tears and watch another.",17 June 2022
"This show has broken with the Star Trek themes, and is reduced to a generic intrigue and drama shows with politically correct weak men and strong women, the main character being of course a strong and frustrated woman who looks constantly annoyed and worried.

Lost are the search for discoveries, the music, the mood, the intelligence, the amazing themes and ethic dilemmas from the age of Picard - there it sits - this was a major disappointment.",27 December 2021
"I like this show. I like the main character and how it's focused on her. I like the war drama, and want to know what will happen. But, I don't like it as a Star Trek. It has a very different feeling to it than the other Star Treks. Here is why I think that is: The other Star Treks didn't have ONE MAIN CHARACTER like Discovery seems to. They had a handful of main characters. The other Star Treks didn't usually have a long running plot that went on for many episodes, but rather, each episode was usually more self contained a story and plot within itself. This Discovery feels like a Saga War Drama from episode One. The other Star Treks showed the handful of main characters in depth. You felt like you got to know them really well. In this one, you barely know any of them. Most of them could just die and you would barely care or notice. The other Star Treks didn't show sex scenes, or romance usually. Except the Original. This Discovery, you can't show to kids. The other Star Treks tried to act like they were exploring space, or on a diplomatic mission, or discovering things. This Star Trek just jumps into a War Show in episode one. Not even pretending to be a science exploration show. There is science in Star Trek Discover, and it does seem high tech, but there isn't a reasoning or hearing of technical terms or learning or hearing about science in this one as much as the other Star Treks. The other Star Treks had a more sophisticated feeling to them, like Classical Music and Chess. This Star Trek feels more like, I don't know less sophisticated. Even though I like Star Trek Discovery, what I liked most about Star Trek The Next Generation was how calm and relaxing it felt. How all the humans, and the aliens mostly got along, and it felt like a very civilized and diplomatic universe. The universe had a good feeling to it in The Next Generation. In the Star Trek Discovery Universe, the aliens are evil to a point that just is bewildering. It's just not peaceful. I know that people like watching war and conflict. But, I really like the peace of The Next Generation. It seems that most Star Trek series eventually turn into a war show. I wish this wasn't the case. Especially with Deep Space Nine. I hated when Deep Space Nine became a war show. It was mostly boring when this happened.",17 January 2018
"Started fine, went full soap opera mid season three. Anyone starting watching, stop with season two. You'll only miss out on a lot of disappointment.",10 January 2021
"Looking at the rating this series gets, I can only shake my head. I tried watching this travesty of a TV series as a Star Trek fan but quickly despaired & gave up. I then tried watching it as a fan of sci-fi and gave up just as quickly. I then gave it a last attempt to watch it for what it was trying to be and even then I couldn't get past the completely unlikely & terrible main character of Michael Burnham.

As a Star Trek TV series this series fails in every single way. Anyone who dares to call this Star Trek needs to get slapped in the face by reality. This is not a series about a bright hopeful future, it's not about watching a crew tackle problems together, it's not about sending the viewers an important message of unity & peace. If you removed the Star Trek references, NO-ONE would have called this Star Trek. NO. ONE.

And as a scifi series it falls flat as well. Burnham is incredibly painful to watch, there's not enough interesting scifi elements, the Klingons are the most tedious & painful characters to watch because some muppet thought having them speak Klingon all the time was authentic (despite completely wrecking their appearance). The characters constantly argue & fight, Burnham is an emotional wreck and pretty much every character is unlikeable.

And even if I try to get what the writers were trying to achieve, all I see is contempt for the source material, contempt for the original fans, contempt for anything that would have made a good series. The rating it gets is more evidence of the drivel the modern audience gets to see on TV rather than the quality of this series because I'll assume this is the only reason it gets a rating above 5.

Luckily, Discovery is such an unimportant series for the fans that it barely gets mentioned. I actually hear far more mentions from Lower Decks (which is a million times more Star Trek than the drivel that is STD) which at least gives me hope that we might still get some better Star Trek in the future.",10 November 2023
"I remember staying home Friday nights to watch TOS because I didn't want to wait for reruns and VHS was still science fiction. For fifty years with the exception of the animated series I have watched all episodes repeatedly and never missed one. I love the storyline this season, new dangers, new time line, but the whispered, emotive soliloquies, again and again and not only by Burnham, have finished it. I have to watch 30 minutes of that silliness to get 8 minutes of storyline. So no more Discovery for me. Hope they don't manage to destroy Picard.",24 December 2020
"I was not happy at first with this new Star Trek series. There were a lot of odd pieces to the story, not to mention odd Klingons. However, as the season progressed, I thought the episodes got better, and the odd pieces of the story started to hang together in a much more cohesive way.

It's true there are many aspects of ST Discovery that are completely out of sync with all the preceding ST series. I began to look at it as an almost total reworking of everything from the original story. I believe this version of Star Trek should be judged on it's own. Don't even try to make connections or comparisons with the other Star Treks.

In my opinion, looked at in this way, this new version has been steadily improving since the pilot episode. The last episode has me hooked. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens to these characters, and how the story line moves from here on.

I know the die hard Star Trek fans are having a hard time with Discovery, but if they can look at this series with fresh eyes, putting aside old concepts of the show, they just might appreciate this one for what it offers - a re-imagining of Star Trek, with just a few connections to the old.",19 November 2017
"When I invited the fellas over to watch an episode of discovery, they all agreed the character Micheal was bad arse. However they did not like the gay scenes, as they spit out the beer and threw popcorn at the screen. Then they started to talk about all the syfy that has gay scenes in them today. When you think about it those scenes 10 years ago would have never made it to television...I had to put on a rented movie. I understand that being gay should be more acceptable by enlightened people today, but all of main stream America is not ready for it in there living rooms, for their children to see and in front of grandma Are we being forced to accept same sex partners?

"I grew up on Star trek, whether it was re-runs of the original series, or Picard and the next generation... I have watched them all...

The prior and aged films that followed were a bit tawdry but the reboot has been great for the franchise as it has spawned Discovery...

Discovery is based as a prequel to what we know as Trekkies and it open to interpretation... so love it some dont...

Personally I think it is amazing, i tis of the time, and uses mdern technology to its best - most but not all of the cgi is seamless andthe scripting is dramatic and filmlike..

I try not to give any hints or spoilers in my reviews but more aim to tell you how I fell watching the shows.... Discovery is not like watching anything star trek you may have seen before, it is a true delight and has me on the edge of my seat every week... I only wish other series could learn from this and stop using has beens, invest more in unknowns and produce good product where there is a lacking gap.",2 February 2018
"Perhaps i am to much of a spoiled viewer of the many star treks series over decades. I did not like deep space 9 a lot, but i watched it, they can not all be NR 1, like voyager, my favorite together with next gen. . Why are the Klingon's looking SO different... why the irritating Klingon with subtitles all the time (demanding on the viewers) keep that for special scenes please i.m.o. . Actors are good, that is not it. The first episode is not fresh or new, we know of the story told there. I had hoped for a build up. . Who does that camera directing? as a gamer i have a high tolerance for non-natural view-shifts. But c'mon zooming in (or out) while going up or down, and sideways, looping, and turning at the same time...? OK for an action scene, but to many of this and people will get 'sick' subconscious seeing this to often. To much of this and there will soon be no 'oh boy, star trek tonight feeling'. ""Someone!?"" ""come here, they are speaking Klingon, you are missing serious series needed info!!"" Or: ""are you in the kitchen? i will read out loud what the Klingon's are saying!"" no need for this, let them speak English most of the time please. . The start scene was nice and 'star Trekkie'. And again, this is a first impression, i wonder what i would write after episode 2. . For now, just a 6 out of 10, i guess due to the actors.",25 September 2017
"The graphics in this show are absolutely stunning, that you actually feel like you are on a different planet or in a spaceship interacting with aliens. Most star trek series feel staged or distant; it feels fake, but a nice idea. This show makes it feel real and possible, the aliens look so real and very creatively made with great filming sets and landscapes. The storyline and plot twists are well thought out to make the show interesting to watch. The cast isn't the best, but Sonequa Martin-Green is a fantastic actress and plays her part beautifully.",7 January 2020
"I really liked the first season (7-8's), the second season was good (7's). The third was ok (mostly 6's). I'm watching the 4th season and see why many episodes are rated around ""5"". One reviewer called this ""woketrek"". I believe this says it all. It's bad. Some episodes are fours, I graded one a six. The rest are fives.

I still love the Michael Burnham character.

I miss a few of the baddies from previous seasons.

Tilly is still barely watchable...I mean, come on. This person made it through a military academy? She should be running a food truck in Paramount's parking lot.

Booker is ok.

Doug Jones always does a fine job as a alien.

The non-binary invisible ""Gray"" love affair is just stupid.

I'll finish this season but will probably cancel Paramount plus after and hope season 5, if there is one, has some new writers, producers etc. Otherwise I'll just save my money.",14 January 2022
"There was a good episode or two during the show that were good quality, but the overall show was terrible and a waste of my time.

Imagine a Star Trek show with a mixture of soap opera content, Transformers movie content, rap music instead of classical literature & music, unrealistic pure fantasy content, cutesy robot characters, suits like you'd expect in an ""Iron Man"" or Marvel comic book movie, bad writing, uninspiring characters, ... all injected into your Star Trek show. And that's what you have here.

Add to that many characters that are not the finest examples of fitness you would expect of the crew of a Federation Starship, many of whom have a host of annoying character traits...

The writing is often quite bad, and often groups like the Klingons of the show don't even behave in ways that make sense in light of the canon established by previous Star Trek shows.

The show hadn't even improved by the end of season 3. If anything, it only got worse...

At that point, I quit watching.",11 March 2022
"No spoilers ahead as I'm not here to do a proper review, to be honest. The first 2 series shows a lot of promise and delivers some of it early on, too. For me personally it goes into the same shelf as Stargate Universe, Expanse or Battlestar Galactica.

Now the real point of this post - what's up with all those 1/10 reviews and ""it's not as good as the original show"" cries? If you're an old-timer, who just hates any movie or any music that was done after 1972, why are you even here ? We get it that this show ""drifts too far"" from the script you loved back in 1929, that it sux to have an actual screenplay with a plot that lasts longer than 35 minutes; we hear you that actors are not as good as that dude that died 30 years ago after reaching a 112; and that women taking lead roles goes against your upbringing... That's all good and great, respect to Baby Boomers or whatever prior generation you represent. But do you really need to come here and rate this show poorly?

To sum up - it's a decent Sci-Fi, more than decent in fact and it deserves a shot, deserves viewers who can still absorb some new ideas and experiences. I liked the first 2 episodes and I look forward to seeing more!",26 September 2017

"Unlikeable unrelatable characters, poor science, explosions and lots of representation. If you've always wanted a science fiction show with a number of LGBT characters, and essentially zero straight white men across the seasons - this might just be the show for you, if your science standards aren't high and you like more of a 'pew pew' approach.

If you want something resembling any other era of Star Trek, you won't find it here. There's little of the 'all for one' harmony and enlightenment of the late era, and none of the 'western in space' frontier elements of the earlier. Literally none of the episodes focus on any kind of interesting character or philosophical dilemmas. The setting is, conflicted, somewhat dystopian and certainly not optimistic.",2 December 2021

I went off to college and my mother would call me about Star Trek. We would talk about old episodes and I would tell here about new DS9 episodes. Today, I thank God my mother is back in Japan and doesn't stream this pornographic web crap! This is beyond bad. You took my childhood and raped it CBS. This isn't even good sci-fi, it is some other show altogether milking off a brand. I am now married with a son, I plan to sit on my sofa and watch the Next Generation and DS9 on DVD with him.

I want Star Trek to be a show that I can watch with my grandkids. Shows like the original series or even the Next Generation. I like the idea of Star Trek, but needs to be more kid friendly. Gene Rodenberry is probably rolling around in his grave. If you want a show to survive, then you need to make it where the entire family can watch it. After all, the kids that would be watching it are the ones who are going to carry the torch and pass the love of Star Trek on to their kids and so on. I guess the directors feel like they've put their big boy pants on or something. Like I always tell my kids....""Just because you can, doesn't mean that you should.""",14 March 2020

Add a bit too much of weak emotions and the need to always explain why they feel like this and like that makes me feel like an idiot viewer.

Can we please get back to what Star Trek is with a touch of modernism... stop making these emotional complications the back bone of space exploration.

Picard was the Captain we all want, but Lorca is the captain you actually get in real life.",22 April 2022
"I didn't expect much when watching this, I never really got into Enterprise so was pretty much expecting a similar sort of feeling.

However I watched this with my son who has never really seen any of the other Star Treks shows/movies except the new Abrams reboot which this ignores.

So I'm pretty much looking at this as an updated reboot of the franchise, well you have to really as these ships are far advanced than what the TOS predicted and the new look Klingons.

I can see all the negativity in the reviews and I can't agree with them maybe I'm not a purist as some are although I was raised on Star Trek loved TOS and TNG tolerated DS9 and Voyager. I enjoyed the first episode and I've spoke to some others who all didn't expect much but also thought it's off to a decent start.

I thought the effects were great and too early to say about the story and writing, I need a few more episodes under my belt first. But I hope they don't drag out each season with loads of episodes as inevitably you end up with many forgettable one off stories that are a yawn fest and a few really good episodes that stand out.

I'll stick with this and see how it goes and hope they mention or bring in the Enterprise NCC1701 under Captain Pike, that would be interesting",27 September 2017
"I hung in there for the first couple of seasons, but I can't go any further. It's just not Star Trek. So many speeches, so much delay of the action to make ourselves aware of our emotional state. I mean an alien could be ready to attack you or a planet ready to explode and they go into these five minute long emotional vomits and how everything is affecting them, I really just don't understand why this is so relevant to their storylines. If any ship in any countries modern military had a crew that was so emotionally unstable in their fleet, they would've parked that ship and dismissed the crew long ago. Put in some more aliens, putt in some more action, put in some more sci-fi and the show might be redeemable.

"I just had to finally write a review, because this show was a huge disappointment. They spent a ton of money on cgi and special effects and admittedly that part looks pretty good. They seemed to skimp on the writing, however. The actors are somewhat decent, considering the material they're given, even though it seems as they are mainly CBS rejects from crappy csi-type shows. I am not sure why execs haven't figured out that the reason people think these shows suck is that they are too dramatic/cheesy. They inject irrelevant humor when they could be answering cool science questions or having them solve riddles or puzzles like the old days of star trek. The show does well with visual spectacle, but falls short on having a story with substance.",24 November 2019

"I just watched the first two episodes and I'm sold. If you're looking for the more cerebral Trek with an alien-of-the-week allegory about life or politics or society, then this show will not be giving you that sort of Trek experience.

Some might say that IS the Trek experience, but I'm not one for being so beholden to tradition.

Instead the show focuses on the people, not necessarily the situation. Michael is a solid and interesting character, and while the show is more dark and gritty, in alignment with the newer Trek movies, it's not bleak.

The three things people complain about:

The Klingons - I just have to stop and say that I love the new redesign of the Klingons. That tired 90's Michael Bolton haircut was doing nobody any favors. In some respects through the course of the various series, the Klingons lost their edge and mystique, they became a caricature of themselves. They were overdue for some changes.

Continuity with the Original Series - Yes, none of this looks like it takes place before the low-budget 1960's version. But it does fit with the JJ Abrams version, and that's the one that's making money. For what it is, it looks great.

CBS All Access - It was announced when the show was first introduced that it would be exclusively on CBS All Access. No one should be surprised by this point about that. Streaming is where everything is heading, and with cord cutters ditching the traditional cable model and pushing for the past 10 years for a la carte pricing, you had to see this kind of thing coming. I'm a cord cutter and this kind of model appeals to me. I love being able to pick and choose my entertainment like this. I like being able to add and subtract services as needed. I added Starz so I could watch American Gods, and subtracted it when the season was over. And it was painless to subscribe and unsubscribe to because it's all in my Google Play account. CBS All Access works the same way. When the season is over, I just have to click ""cancel"" and done. No fights with salespeople!

The problem with Trek has always been in it's limited appeal. It has a small, but strong and vocal audience. The shows kept getting canceled because there just isn't enough audience to sustain it for very long. If CBS wanted to cater specifically to that audience of aging Trek fans, then they would have tried to keep it as true to the original series as possible. Obviously they've decided to make it appeal to a wider, modern audience. The thing you hear about people who were never Trek fans until the JJ Abrams movies is that the show felt boring and unwelcoming. It felt exclusive, not inclusive. Like you had to have a degree in thermodynamics to ""get it"". You don't, but that's the stigma the show had regardless. Besides, you go back and watch any of the previous series in 2017 and they seem campy and hokey by today's standards.

A cerebral show designed to look perfectly like it fits 10 years before Shatner's Kirk would get at least some of the die-hard fans, and probably last one season on network TV. And CBS would probably never touch a Star Trek TV series again. This has obviously been designed to appeal to a modern, non-Trek audience, and to be more accessible to new fans by focusing on character and story more than the allegorical and metaphorical aspects. And it works, in my opinion. We have a much more engaging story, more emotional, and more intimate in some ways than previous series.

It's great SciFi and a welcome reintroduction of Trek to a modern audience. I recommend giving it a chance.",27 September 2017
"I've watched literally every episode of every Star Trek series, starting from the original series,right through to this, and have loved most of it.

The technical details, emotional narrative, storytelling, character development, pace, the balance of sciency stuff and action etc. - not to mention how it all looks (gorgeous) - almost everything is perfect.

I hope somehow they keep up the quality and produce many more seasons as good as this.

It loses a point because I think at times it's too dramatic for it's own good, and leans too much on the emotions and quirkiness of the characters. I think it would be benefit from calming down a little, but this is a personal thing.",24 January 2019
"Unfortunately like many other reviewers here, I share the same opinion...First 3 seasons were still like sci-fi series and watchable for the Star Trek fans. Well, since the beginning of Star Trek Discovery we all felt that this one is kinda different. We have seen way more emotional relationships, drama, romance and such an effort to give good moral messages, but in season 4 the script writers have unfortunately exceeded the limits and every episode it only gets worse and worse! Saying this as a big fan of Star Trek who has fully completed ""The Next Generation"" and ""Voyager"" series; now I actually feel like I watch ""drama, romance"" series with some space adventure in it!!",4 January 2022

"It's not like the old ones but better (in my eyes).

The philosophical background and dilemmas are better (no easy answers, no ""lessons"" about what is right and wrong... so far) The Characters are acting realistically and comprehensibly not such TNG, VOY etc. god like creatures who know exaclty what is to do.

In all ST series, we could get to know members of the star ship. This is whole mumbo-jumbo show and not real Star Trek. Disaster. Unnecessarily Ruined. Also why are we back in past, hesus me, go in to the future. How many past series do you need to make? Also, when you make ST in past, how can they be more advanced that Jim's original Star Trek. In this you have technology and people you don't have in Picard's or Janeway's ships.

Cast and crew, thank you for the great show!!",20 April 2019
"I found the first episode very, very promising. Clearly the filmmakers did their utmost best to make things recognisable for the Trekkies and let's face it: Trekkies do love recognisable stuff, like meeting old friends! I loved the quarreling between the characters. And though the cgi was much better than that of the older series, that is not what makes a good Star-trek series. It is the chemistry between the players! I think I am gonna enjoy this long awaited series. Thumbs up!!",25 September 2017
"I've seen the 2 episodes. Lots of visual effects. But the casting... damn it. Even more superficial than Star trek Enterprise from few years back. Nothing like a believable and intelligent Picard or a Janeway. The actors do not fit their role.

The Klingons wear latex masks that are so cheap that it's laughable. I don't want to be reminded that its a costume party. It needs to look at least a little real.

Lots of eye candy, main characters on the Federation side are not convincing, feels like a b-rated space action movie. Not like star trek nuance and deepness.",26 September 2017
"I just logged after years just to rate it 10 as a compensation for all the detractors.

This is a good show. Period.

Plot: check ! Book level quality plot, I know , I'm reading a lot of SF. Most of the other Star Trek shows had silly horrible stories, rarely extending for more then one episode. The Borg / Captain Picard is the only one more developed that is crossing my mind now.

Acting: check ! No one can tell me that Jason Isaacs as Captain Gabriel Lorca is nothing but insanely good.

Sets: check ! This is almost HBO level production. Even the introduction takes heavy influence from True detectives / Westworld.

Now, is this a 7.3 show ? NO !!! Some people don't like it, mostly from what I see old Star Trek fans. That is good. The old Star Trek was mediocre.

For others that like the SF genre in general and were waiting for a decent show beside Expanse, WAIT NO MORE !",22 October 2017
"Absolutely disgusting version! I had to turn it off 3 episodes in, this is not Star Trek. Written with today's forced Hollywood agenda. Ruined Star Trek for many many years no doubt and would have Captain Janeway and Pickard turning in their future graves!",2 April 2019
"Why o why did the star trek franchise agree to this crap?? This show is so utterly horrible it makes the xindi debacle of star trek enterprise seem tolerable.

And for all the people screaming that the only reason for negative reviews is some kind of racism- puhlease.

Star trek is the OG of inclusivity. It did not matter who was the leader or in the crew - human, andorian, or anyone else. This review has nothing to do with any actors ethnicity and everything to do with the utter lack of substance, plot, and talent.

For something that should never have been made, these many episodes and seasons are already too much. This is NOT star trek. Just a terrible show riding on the wave of an epic series.",8 March 2023
"The trailer for this show was poorly chosen. When you think Star Trek, you don't think chaos, you think order, and calm rational thought. The trailer was pure chaos in action, very unlike Star Trek.

The show on the other hand, is very Star Trek, with everything you would expect.

When I first heard about this series, and then saw the trailer, I thought this show was doing force diversity, diversity for diversity sake. Like shoving a square into a round hole. Doesn't really work out very well.

I made my opinion on the show, that it was going to crash and burn.

I was wrong.

The show is nothing like the trailer. It's very orderly, calm, and rational.

I'm a sci-fi fan, I don't care what you look like, I care about how you act, and interact with others, and I judge people individually, and try not to let the actions of a few, poison my view on a whole race.

So I could care less if the captain is female, and the 1st officer. I only care if they are good in their parts.

Michelle Yeoh did a good job, but we didn't really get to know her very well.

Sonequa Martin-Green, the 1st officer, I really like her character. I didn't realize she was at least Vulcan trained, not sure if she is part Vulcan or not, till a bit into the show. It made me look at her character differently.

I didn't see any characters that I didn't like.

I've seen many reviews complaining about how high tech everything looks, instead of making it look old style like the original, since this takes place 10 years before the first series.

Well, I look at it this way. This is a reboot of the series, and today, we have much better CGI and so forth, that they made the ship look high tech as it should be. They even changed the Klingon's greatly. The art style is really good.

Yet, for some reason, we didn't see any shields during the fight, it was like they were defenseless. I like seeing shields, the lack of the depiction of shields feels wrong.

The preview for the coming series, is a much better trailer of the show than what they chose. This series looks like it holds promise.

This is a modern day take, on a very old series, it takes place 10 years before the original, yet, looks like it took place far in the future after it. I don't really have a problem with this. Every new Star Trek series after this, can look high tech as well, which I think of as a plus.

I think this show was made with a lot of thought, and hopefully the following episodes have a lot in store for us. So, try watching this series with a open mind, and stop living in the past.",25 September 2017
"I am new to Star Trek but even after watching a small portion of the older shows, I feel as if this Star Trek: Discovery does not emulate a few of the key, classic Star Trek ideals.

Generally speaking, it seems as if the writers, producers, etc. are trying to appeal more to people who generally would not be fan's of Star Trek and make it seem ""cool"" rather than thinking of the fans that have followed it from the beginning (or at least, know of some of the classics). I understand trying to please everyone would be difficult but some effort would have been appreciated.

In addition to the notes above, the writing seemed lazy and was almost painful to watch in certain scenes. It was probably the most disappointing part of it all.

However,I did enjoy the darker, mysterious aspect of the show. Several episodes ended in a perfect cliffhanger, giving me no other choice than to click the ""Next Episode"" option. I believe it gives the show a new skin to walk around in and has great potential for future episodes.

As far as characters go, Lorca is by far my favorite. He is perplexing and manipulative and I believe that makes him all the more interesting.",4 December 2017
"It is no star trek. It is a romcom with expensive cgi as backdrop. Characters are unlovable, captain is like superhero solving every problem, even single handedly restored the federation. Characters are too much fragile and emotional. Too much politically correct.

"The big geek question is Star Trek or Star Wars. I am a Star Trek fan. I love that it's a story about our future. Our technology. It focuses on ideals of peace and an ideal vision of what humanity can be. That appeals to me.

This new series adheres to that formula and injects so many exciting new adventures. The characters are well developed. The storyline progresses beautifully. The only disappointment is that I have to wait a week for the next episode.

Some wage continuing story catches my interest, just worried they are as dull as the Klingon, but their godlike appearance and actions suggest good will. Problems that happens are solved more like old ST. It is a new crew and I do have some trouble trusting their decisions.

Season 1 was war, I don't like war even in fiction or history but science of war can be good. It has nice tempo (not slow as Orville), and scenery is great.",25 January 2019

In fact, I think the premise and story were well done. It was interesting how they figured out how to make first contact and how they stop the impending calamity. Yet, there were so many social ""teaching"" moments one got the feeling that the writers were changing people's minds instead of telling a good story. My suggestion is to concentrate on just a few of the characters within and make their presence crucial to solving whatever problem needs solving in the last season. Develop those characters, and make what they do interesting, rather than who they are.",17 March 2023

"First of all, I'm a massive Star Trek fan. I've seen every episode of every series and watched all the movies more than once.

Star Trek Discovery, for me at least, is as good as the all other series.

People have to remember that the older series had 20-26 episodes per season, which gave them plenty of time to develop stories and characters.

Even though Discovery has half as many episodes I still feel character development has been excellent. Tilly, Stamets, Saru and Philippa being some of the standouts.

Yes, it is mostly focused on Michael but if you think about it, the other series mostly focused on the core characters, the elite bridge crew, especially at the start, and then expanded as the series of progressed.

ST:NG was rubbish, in my opinion, till series 3. Same goes for ST:DS9. But they both grew to become some of the most amazing Sci Fi shows created.

Season 3 hasn't been as good as season 2 so far but I'm still enjoying it and can't wait for more.

Here's my ranking of the ST series, from best to worst:

Voyager Next Generation Discovery (based on Seasons 1 & 2) Deep Space Nine Enterprise (ended too soon) Star Trek Original Series (Loved Spook and Bones, hated Kirk) Picard (really struggled with this one, even though Picard is my favourite Captain)",15 April 2021
"Hello From Here - What a mission! I forced myself to watch series 3, then series 4, to give a fully rounded review but it has been hard work!

Series 1 & 2 blew me away, absolutely stunning Sci-Fi, possibly 9 Stars. Discovery - s1 & s2 and also The Expanse are some of the best Sci-Fi I can remember. But then....

It all falls apart! Discovery - s3 & s4 are excruciating to watch. Badly acted, disgracefully weak scripts, characters that make you cringe at how poorly they are now portrayed. A heavily female lead cast that's rammed down your throat, a pathetic non binary (I guess) couple for absolutely no reason other than to say it's represented in the show! Oh, and let's not forget the gay male couple that looks after them, just so the studio can say they're inclusive and current!

None of the this would matter if it was to better the production. But it's badly put together, badly thought out and has pushed the quality and depth of storytelling straight off a cliff. PLEASE watch s1 & s2, they truly are separate and have no connection with the mess that starts from series 3. I'm still utterly shocked at what Discovery has become!",17 March 2022
So the only way to watch this is to pay some service? If that is the only way to watch it I will never watch it and it looks like from the reviews it is not even worth watching. Makes me mad they advertise the show on TV but don't show it on regular TV. This a load of crap that you have to pay to watch it and they advertise all over TV.,27 October 2017
"Wow, I don't think I remember seeing THIS many butthurt reviews for an instalment ever. Seriously? Crappiest show ever made? Sweet bejesus can you guys get any more pathetic?

I've loved Trek since I was a kid, meaning I was raised on TNG, watched all of ST since, so not exactly an outsider to the Trek universe. The first two episodes left me mildly surprised as I was expecting a bit more gritty, modernised version of the show. Although the acting felt extremely wooden, and I didn't really like the lead, AND I wasn't exactly crazy about the whole Klingon war premise, I still wasn't disappointed.

But, boy did E03 deliver! Y - E - S! That's what I want to see in Trek of today. And when I get nostalgic for the good old super positive and squeaky clean Trek (again with a sweet little modern twist), I have the equally amazing Orville. All the while waiting for Expanse S03, Black Mirror S04, etc. Jesus, what a time to be alive! We've NEVER had better sci-fi shows on TV, let alone this many at once. So quit bitching and ride this amazing wave while it lasts!

TL;DR First two episodes good, third episode awesome, hope it continues in this manner.

8.5/10, giving it a 10 because seriously guys?

Cheers",3 October 2017
"> Comparing this to older Star Trek, is like trying to compare LeBron James to Michael Jordan, you can't do it b/c it's a completely different era, and it isn't fair.

I think if you take it for what it is and don't constantly keep comparing it to other/older ST series, then you should like it. This is a newer, darker, and more ""edge of your seat"" version.

> The action and suspense are great, and the scenery in season 3 is breathtaking ! I

Each characters is unique, charming and funny. You can't help but like all of them; they are a funny dysfunctional group that you want to be in.

> I think if you like shows like: Battlestar Galactica, Dark Matter, The Expanse, any/all Stargate series, Firefly, etc., then you will like this series.",3 February 2022
"Revisiting my positive review from the first series I have to say this has been a fantastic ride.

If your a star trek purist there is probably nothing I can say to change your mind if you don't already like it. For me I grew up watching TNG, DS9 and Voyager on VHS. I love the classic series too and the movies. This is a great addition to a back catalogue of stories and lore.

Discovery is set in the star trek universe so theres a lot of familiarity but its done in a more modern style with more action, faster paced episodes and brilliant special effects.

I love modern gritty action Sci-Fi. I love Star Trek. Why not both?

The first two seasons spend a lot of time skirting around and trying to fit carefully around the original cannon without trampling on what came before. Its a balancing act that I feel the writers have mostly pulled off.

From my perspective what they added to the cannon is fine and makes no change to the old stories or what we understood. They could have made Spock female and underwent a sex change as a child but thankfully they didn't go down that route like other franchises we know... (Doctor Who for example where the writers retconned the doctors gender and species destroying /re-writing decades of established lore... urrrggh )

The third season kicks off in an excellent direction setup wonderfully by the writers to allow completely new stories to be told and changing the main mission of the crew to one that closely follows the core fundamental values established by star trek lore.

I have heard the argument that this show could have been a stand alone scifi show without any relation to star trek. Sure ok.. but it recycles lots of excellent concepts and technology and plays with the ideals and morales of star fleet from an individuals standpoint. It undoubtedly triggers emotional responses from the viewers.

Ultimately its a ""what if"" scenario that we see played out. It's star trek from a different perspective and one that is told with characters who are not perfect by starfleet standards and that the idealistic problem free ascended society portrayed by the original story is not a complete picture of star fleet or mankind as a whole.

Can't wait to see what it does next. :)",26 September 2017
"The FX and the fact this is a show named Star Trek are the only reasons why I rate this a six and not lower. My main problem with Discovery is not the woke-ness, but that the characters are not likable. I usually have a favorite character in every Star Trek show, but not in this one. I like Saru, but it's more because of his FX design then any particular character trait. I also found the crew to be very un-Starfleet like. They lacked the discipline and self-resolve I normally associate with StarFleet officers, and they really do seem like emotional wrecks in almost every episode. I had to force myself to finish the last season, but since I was not emotionally invested in any of the characters I really didn't care what happened to any of them. I wanted to check the box off my watchlist and that's what I did.",31 July 2022
"A couple of things bother me:

Too much narration for a start. The show shouldn't need a narrator if it's done right. If it needs to constantly explain the plot, something is very wrong.

At every point when haste is required (as in a battle) - characters will suddenly stop to stare into each other's eyes for an infuriating amount of time. Lives are at stake, but hey, let me stop & look into your eyes for 30 seconds.

Sheesh!",8 February 2021
Absolutely garbage. Generic sifi with the Star Trek name but absolutely nothing like real Star Trek shows. Would be better if it was it's own thing and not a Trek shows but not by much.,22 November 2021
"May I first say the tv show itself got off to a relatively slow start, the two part beginning was an amazing entry but after that the show was slow and honestly didn't feel like star trek with consistent episodes based around the war with the Klingon, however the show hit a new high with its mid season final and even before then had some quality interesting episodes such as ""Magic to Make the Sanest Man Go Mad"". The later mid season with introduction to another plot which I won't reveal made the show vastly more interesting however, even though the plot itself is something that has been visited by nearly every other star trek series. Never the less Star trek discovery managed to keep it interesting, and although some episodes were obviously filler it was a awesome story line and I can't wait to see the conclusion within the last two episodes.

However the show does suffer some bad points, for starts some of it just doesn't feel like star trek, but rather a drama show on a space ship, being introduced to new aliens and technologies throughout the series is what made the show so fun, new threats and new mysteries, which the show does partially with its mid season plotline and other one off episodes, but in other places fails poorly with the same old Klingon war story line. But overall the show is amazing and no star trek show has ever started out perfectly, the first few seasons of Voyager, or Star trek next generation are perfect examples of this.

Why the 10 stars with such a mixed review? its evident in the review section that this show has been completely bombed by angry fans, everyone's entitled to opinions, but 1/10 reviews? When I think ""this show is bad"" I'd normally give it a review of around 4, 5 maybe, but 1? its evident that this is just to get the score down after angry fans just hate how the old star trek formula isn't in use for a lot of this show, now if you look at the dates of these reviews, what do you see? reviews that have been placed before barely any episodes have even come out, meaning they cant even begin to review a series they have barely seen, I wouldn't be surprised if these reviews were coordinated via a Star Trek fan forum somewhere asking users to review bomb the show. For this fact I have upped what I would say is around a 8.5/10 show to a 10/10 to try and help counter this flow of troll reviews.",31 January 2018

"Watching the last episodes of Season 3 and thought they were really good. Yes, Michael Burnham cries at times, but she also had some great fight scenes and came up with great solutions to dire circumstances. I'll miss Michelle Yeoh, but I'm looking forward to the next season of Discovery. I don't get the low ratings from some people. I actually thought this was an 8, but moved it up to 10 to put some balance here. I recall when TNG started, fans were outraged that it wasn't even close to measuring up to the original ST. It took a few seasons before the old fans warmed up to TNG.",2 February 2021
"People seem to forget that LITERALLY every single new star trek series was almost completely different to the last, adds cannon that completely contradicts pre-existing cannon, and redesigns the klingons. It is different to old star trek, in the way that it has to be, since there's a 20 year gap between this and the last series. The first season, while enjoyable, lacked a lot for me personally. It missed that community vibe I'd loved from other Star Trek series so much. Every episode had to be part of the main plot, rather than just a fun side adventure. I also really struggled to get through the first three episodes and was initially very disappointed. The second season fixes more or less any and all issues I had with the first. I don't think I have a single complaint about the second season, I absolutely love it, and so does everyone I know.",31 March 2019

"I was 14 when TOS came out. I'm in my 60s now, have been a loyal Trekkie my entire adult life, and I say ST Discovery has got potential! Yes, the first season was untypically dark, all about one person's guilt trip, but think of it this way: it was Star Trek the way it would have been written by screen-writers in the Terran Empire-gritty and mean, but still familiar. (And at least we didn't have to suffer a return of V'ger!) As for the gnashing of teeth over Klingon appearance, really?!? I just chuckled, remembered the change from TOS to TNG looks and Worf's explanation: ""We do not speak of it."" Enter the second season, admittedly much better! With the guest captaincy of Captain Pike and his swashbuckling reminiscent of James T., the return of endearingly corny dialogue a la every Trek iteration ever, as well as enlargment of scope to allow for true ST ensemble character development with the likes of Tilly, Stamets and Saru, Discovery settled down and began to look like true Trek. (Not to mention another slick Klingon explanation: ""Now that the war is over, they're growing their hair back.) Bahaha! C'mon, the second season is fun! (Who cares if we never heard of Spock's step sister before? Sibling rivalry and alienation of affection go a long way toward explaining Spock's eschewing of his emotional human side, his eventual great attachment to Kirk, his replacement brother, and his combative relationship with Bones, his erstwhile nemesis.) You people are fussing over Discovery as though the show makers had done something really radical-like take the characters off a starship and put them on a base somewhere in deep space near the Cardassian border. Ahem. I hear they have renewed it for a third. To quote Captain Pike, I say...""Hit it!""",3 March 2019
"If people would stop judging this series by its similarity or rather lack thereof to a collection of series antiquated in both visual design and storytelling, they would discover a solid sci-fi, doing its namesake justice not by some anachronistic regurgitation of the same, half a century old tropes, but by delivering an immersive sci- fi experience incredibly strong in narrative, emotional depth, and tense action at times, which is everything that Star Trek stood for at its core since the beginning.

The visuals and pacing were updated to 21st century series standards flawlessly, while retaining all the elements of the established Star Trek universe so far that are important in providing that unique Star Trek feel along with some subtleties we have learned to know and love with the previous series. Because of this, Discovery feels way more Star Trek than any J. J. Abrams movie ever did. While it's too early to tell whether we'll get the original sense of scale - something the J. J. Abrams movies completely ruined - there's something about the way this story is being told that already makes it feel vast.

As an avid Star Trek fan of nearly 3 decades, I am fully satisfied with this series, after only having watched this prequel to the Discovery story-line it's already my third or fourth favorite series of the franchise and I have no doubt it will only continue to grow on me as I watch more of it.",25 September 2017
"This show is a mess.

The lead character, Michael Burnham, is played by an actress who has been good... in other things. Check her performance in TWD. But the character is a Mary Sue, always right, always adored and never truly called out for egregious behavior.

The guest stars (Michelle Yeoh and Jason Isaacs) in the first season provide much needed gravitas and acting chops. But it isn't enough. The regular characters are a whiny, incompetent mess, and I agree with the reviewer that called Tilly the worst Star Trek character of all time. Heaven forbid she ever succeeds in becoming a captain.

Season 2 (yeah I came back for more punishment) is only of value because of the Strange New Worlds character introductions and the trip to the iconic Talos IV. But other than that it's another weak swing and a huge miss.

Almost every Trek series has rough spots, or poor seasons (yes STNG season 1 we're talking about you) but this series has failed to deliver each year, and perhaps not surprisingly, gotten worse.

You can't sacrifice plot, character development and story for agendas. If that's what you want then maybe you'll like this.

When a family member decided to watch this series despite my suggestion to give it a pass, he told me after 10 episodes, ""I should have listened to you."" Amen.

Production values are very good, which is why I gave it three stars, for that and the previously mentioned positives.

But this show isn't Star Trek.

It's unfathomable that they green lit 5 seasons. Which just goes to show you: if someone in Hollywood has an agenda to promote there is no hesitation to start a bonfire of cash.

I would suggest watching the fundamentally superior Strange New Worlds.",1 September 2023

The storyline in ""Discovery"" is good and interesting, and the character gallery is full of variety and offers something for just about everyone.

Yes, it's a bit heavy handed with the diversity/SJW thing, but if you can brush that aside like so much dandruff you'll be pretty pleased with what remains - high production values which feel cinematic more often than you'd imagine, and pretty decent plots. For instance, this season picks up where S02 ended when everyone charged into the distant future (almost 1k yrs) but were confronted with a devastating phenomenon termed ""The Burn"" and occupies our protags all season long. Also, this season is even more of the Sonequa M-G (""Michael Burnham"") show than before, which is amazingly baffling. And this season she discovers her Batman voice (ugh), finds romance (ugh) while also throwing Bruce Lee death stares (ugh). Yes, girls and boys, she does it all, and you'll see all her crazy capabilities on display in the exciting (though eye-rollingly implausible), cinematic season finale which ended as if it were the series finale, but apparently there'll yet be another one. Doubt I'll continue, I think it should've ended as it did, with her getting the captain's chair. I've had enough of her story already. *** Season 2 review *** Star Trek: Discovery (S02, 14 eps, 1hr, CBSAA) First, I skipped season one because I had an allergic reaction to E01's heavy handed diversity-first, and concomitant euro-caucasian biases. But the reviews for S02 were much more encouraging that it had become more mainstream. So I tried and I liked! The production values are feature-film quality, love Anson Mount as Capt Pike and Sonequa M-G (""The Walking Dead"") is really really good as the lead, Cmdr Michael (counter-gender, hmm) Burnham. Look, not everything is unicorns and rainbows here, there's still a lot of diversity/PC stuff happening but it's not so heavy handed and easily FF'ed. However, some of the writing/dialogue is just outstanding, I started noticing it in E07 but I couldn't take time out to write things down, but some of the quotes are amazing for the epic scope of this season's plot. Not a fan of time travel but this implementation of it is really interesting and is more plausible than most. It's still confusing and I think I may have to re-watch the whole season to ""get it"" because A LOT happens in E13-14, including a true star wars battle not often seen, even in that other franchise. Keep an open mind and let go of the other Star Trek franchises and you may find a new show you want to follow.",18 August 2020
"First: great story. Excellent writing. The design, tech and the effects are exemplary. I will always watch Star Trek.

But please stop the whispering and the crying all the time. It is unbearable. Who gave the OK for that? Why is this potentially brilliant high budget series infected with this weird emo virus?

The 6/10 is there because the story and the design saved the show.",27 November 2020
"Really like it!

It has rehashed the Star Trek universe. Hated the first five episodes but stuck with it. Season 2 is much better and I love Saru. He's the closest ""genuine"" character in my mind. Michelle Yeoh is fun to watch. Tilly was annoying but then appreciated the acting.

It's very hashy with credulity and lots of too-easy conclusions or solutions but it's definitely grown on me.",18 September 2020
"I've been a big fan of Star Trek Discovery. Its earlier seasons offered some exciting drama, some cool sci-fi technical innovations and presentations, coupled with superb technical delivery and acting.

This last season it appears things have gone off the boil a bit - it doesn't quite have the cohesion and consistency of previous work and seems to increasingly deliver unrealistic plot devices, action and outcomes.

For all that, it's still entertaining sci-fi, and definitely Star Trekky, although I prefer the slightly grungier realism of Battle Star Galactica and The Expanse.",7 January 2022
"I am very surprised at the number of 'so called' Star Trek fans writing very lengthy reviews to diss this long awaited epic return of this awesome generation-defining franchise.

First off...I am a trekkie...I have watched and or have all...yes...ALL the seasons of Star Trek from the Original Series(1966-1969) to Next Generation (1987-1994), Deep Space 9 (1993-199), Voyager (1995-2001), Enterprise (2001-2005) and now Discovery (2017-). I even have all the movies released from the 1979 motion picture to Star Trek Beyond in 2016. I say this just to prove to anyone reading that I know my onions.

Star Trek Discovery is a long awaited return to the franchise. I've read people complaining that it doesn't follow the Star Trek way of fun and light heartedness. People also said they changed too many things e.g. The Klingons appearance. The only thing I can say is that it was a necessary and bold move. It was necessary to bring new life into the franchise. All other previous seasons of the beloved franchise are still long in our memory and seared into our hearts however, Discovery does absolutely NOTHING to tarnish those sweet memories. Its it's own show. Try watching any of The Next Generation or DS9 now and you'd be amazed how poor the acting and set designs were in the initial launch seasons. But we loved them anyways; the characters, the relationship between them and the engaging stories/adventures that grew from season to season. STD's acting is top notch. The visuals are crazily amazing for a TV series and each episode is fast paced filled with action; leaves you wanting for more. Not to mention we get to relive the ST nostalgia all over again. You can't have Star Trek without exploration and I truly believe we'll see alot of that in further seasons ahead. I mean...even the ship is named 'Discovery'. Just be patient with it; be open minded and give this show a chance. It WILL build. Dont hold on too much to what you KNEW about Star Trek; embrace what it's becoming. Things change...and sometimes they change for the better. Trust me...this is one of such times. I'd bet you'd be pleasantly surprised.

Ps- The only sci-fi show I'd rate just a little higher than this is The Expanse. If you love science fiction then you can't go wrong with either of them

UPDATE!!!

I wrote the above review after Season 1 and 2 and gave it a 10 star rating. Now, I'm taking some stars off. It had so much promise then. Unfortunately, they have tailed off and done a complete 180, now focusing more on political correctness and woke culture. There is now less Sci-Fi with fantastical adventures and more drama, drama, drama; and unfortunately, not the good kind. I still recommend the Expanse though for your Sci-Fi fix. Can't go wrong there. Others I can recommend are; 12 Monkeys (One in which the series is better than the feature movie in my opinion), Battlestar Galactica, The 100, Dark, Raised by Wolves, and Altered Carbon.",18 July 2018
I like to watch completed series; so I don't get stuck with a cliff hanger. When I saw 4 seasons thought that was good. Seemed like every episode was the same except in an alter dimension. I had to do puzzles on my iPad; which didn't help. Finally gave up after 10 episodes. Don't see how they could have made it any worse.,6 March 2022
Absolutely fantastic.. Ignore the whingers. Trekkies are some of the biggest moaners around. So ignore. The program is awesome.,27 January 2019
"Probably the entire budget was invested in aesthetics so that there was no more room for brains...sadly. I'm not a Star Trek fanatic but I loved the past series, the grace of their Universe; everything was so smart, logic, consistent even in the smallest of details...now all you find is a beautiful, frustrating mess...the second season is a total disaster if I compare it with the brilliant past shows. The sad part is that many aspects of this prequel contradicts theories and constructions of 'the past' in the most infantile forms.

This was the first star trek that I watched while working; it only deserved a small fraction of my attention.

ps: I gave it five stars just because of the ""family name""",5 June 2019
"Really caught my interest at first - I'm a big Star Trek fan. I've pushed through the first 2 seasons but I'm not sure I'll go any further. The story seems to focus way too much on Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) with a few side stories involving other characters. All the tears, the personal and emotional drama; it's just too much. It's not what I'm looking for in a Star Trek series. I gave it 6/10 because there are a lot of great visuals",13 May 2020
"Every episode has enough power for Cinema.

I ""grew"" up with TNG 1992. But Disc. cleans with the 90s dusty series.

I really hope they will transport the old Enterprise to our century. Today we do not need anymore ""Buttons"" at the bridge. The action and movement shown there, that is fresh blood. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ PS: Watch the entire season collectively , it's not made seeing week after week in my opinion. It is a ""bigger"" Thing ;)",14 February 2018
"'Startrek - Discovery' announced its presence with an interesting premise and a strong and intriguing lead character and supporting cast. Urgency and excitement were effective situational narrative devices applied in the writing of the second series which built on the strengths of the fist. However, the second series ended on a strong endnote - all be it rather lengthy in its telling. Disappointingly, the third series felt entirely flat, under-delivering on creative direction, storyline development, pace and interest. There was little which the audience could consume as new or unique. In my humble opinion, with the closing of this third series, this iteration of the Startrek storyline should be brought to a close.

As is often the case in many mainstream US-centric television-aligned productions, a storyline with considerable potential was poorly developed and creative projection was lost in a fog of unimaginative under-creativity.",1 February 2021
"Disclaimer: I generally enjoyed the first 2 season with the highlight being the one where Chris Pike took over captain duties for a while.

Season 4 is bad. Like really ""can't sit through without cringing or fidgeting"" bad. Plot is the standard Discovery and crew being the only thing that can stop a threat to universe. Throw in boring Federation politics, forgettable set pieces, awkward inter-species love story, deep contemplative dialogues every 5 minutes, scientific sounding exposition to explain what the heck they are doing and mutiny into the mix and we get Season 4.

The problem is that there's too much telling, not enough showing. Crucial plot progression happens during meetings and everything gets resolved when someone or something happened just in the nick of time. Just when you think the story is moving forward- and then BOOM- pensive music swells up to have two people sitting quietly talking about how they feel about just what happened.

Saru said it best in one episode where they've reached the edge of the galaxy barrier and he poured cold water on the crew's wonderment by saying, ""Frontiers are always cool...if only we could enjoy it.""

Well, I had signed up for wonder and all I ever wondered was when the episodes will end.",28 March 2022
"Why such critical reviews? Why not just still back and enjoy the escapism? Most of these reviews are from Star Trek snobs, and not all of those films have been good. Rogue One was the most diabolically slow and banal film I have ever seen. More please, I love the emotional Michael.",23 December 2020
"7 Episode in update: Discovery still is a rather unique star trek series in many aspects, yet I am liking it more and more. Newer episodes have been okay to even great depending on each episode.

Moral dilemmas are surfacing, yet still not as predominant as in other series. Diplomacy and exploration of new worlds are still absent.

I've got to know a bit more about certain characters, and have come to like captain Lorca and Stamitz, Burnham I am still not too sure about and I wish we would have gotten more on Saru at this point (since i found him to be the most interesting cast member at start).

Later episodes have a more star trek feeling to them, most of all ep7 which was terrific in my opinion. These have more of a star trek feeling to them than the first 3, yet it's still not the same.

Even though it might not become a Star Trek series like the others, it is getting more and more enjoyable to watch and I am looking forward towards new episodes.

Original 3 episode in review:

After watching the first 3 episodes of this series I've come to like and dislike several things I've seen so far: Star Trek Discovery starts out a lot darker than any Star Trek series so far. Its way of telling the story has also changed a lot from previous series (Seen all several times except from TOS which was too dated for me).

Originally Star Trek had a more episodic style of telling a story, with less focus on a single character. Discovery is going a different path where it is thus far focused on one single character and the series gets more sequential. Therefore, this point I find it hard to be truly invested in the story and characters, but this might improve a lot over time.

As previous Star Trek series were all about ethics, diplomacy, cultural differences and moral dilemmas, the new series thus far barely touches these subjects, instead it seems to be about exclusively about the federation-Klingon war.

Characters backgrounds have not been well established, except for those of Saru and Burnham (So far I like Saru a lot though). This may change in the future but so far it gives the other characters a rather hollow feeling.

Discovery also is a lot darker than previous series. Not only the story itself but also the ship and its crew itself feel a lot darker than almost anything federation I've seen thus far. If I would have to make a guess now I'd say this series is more about section 31 than about the Federation, though the series itself does not directly name or hint at S31.",2 October 2017
"There is nothing worse than developing a new series, only to discover you have run out of ideas and, worse still,that tapping into warmongering rhetoric, is, seemingly, your only recourse.

This dead on arrival series is, to me, an empty vacuum, sucked dry of the sense of hope, joy, humour and boundless optimism that made Star Trek, such a hugely popular series in the 1990's.

Its a sad departure that seems to follow the current climate of weirdo politics in the US; marrying up a paranoid and inexplicable fear of a threatening ""boogeyman"", in this case the Klingon's, with ""first strike"" military hysteria.

After two episodes of Discovery I'd simply had enough. Beam me up Scotty! Two out of ten from me.",26 September 2017
"-I had my doubts when i saw the trailers,because they were so lame ,but i find the new series pretty good ,for the first time since Deep Space Nine ,the pilot episode is not weird ,the acting is great,although the Klingons are played very bad ,i never saw something worse until now,only T'Kuvma is outstanding,i liked him as a character,he was a great adversary.The new uniforms are reminding me about Star Trek : Enterprise ,although i always wanted to see something more sober,like the ones from Doom ,Andromeda,Babylon 5 in the last seasons ,Stargate SG-1 or The Last Ship, with pockets ,more realistic and from many types and adapted to atmosphere of the planet. I still don't understand why they changed the look of the Klingons,if they want to stay close to the original canon,the Klingons ,their costumes and their ships,THE BIRDS OF PREY should look more common ,because they are classic and anyway the new ones are not better looking.I am very disappointed from that point of view,like almost all the old fans,because something classic has always more value than something new and i still hope the producers will bring back the old Star Trek :The Motion Picture Klingons,because soon many of us will consider this just another reboot , fancy but cheap in the same time ,which will be lost in the past,faster than you think.If this series had the classic races of aliens,unchanged,Birds of pray and Warbirds ,this series could have been one of the greatest sci-fi series ever !!!...If they can bring back something worthless like a T.O.S. communicator,they can do this with something more important like the classic races.",26 September 2017
I get that some people didn't like the first season. But the second is pure Star Trek! And for me this season is the best of all the series. I don't get the hate. It's like Star Trek is supposed to be and if the old series had the same effects as today they had been more like this. If you do hate this series please stop watching all the ep just for hate. Re do TNG and let some of us enjoy it you don't have to watch something you don't like. Get a life and get over it!,9 June 2020
"Been reading a lot of user reviews slamming this. Couldn't disagree more. Three episodes in, and it's very good sci-fi.

The lead is great, the effects are great, and the storyline is good so far. Sure, some of the action is a little cheesy, but it's TV.

The mistake many of these user reviewers are making is to be too beholden to the previous Star Trek series when rating this.",1 October 2017
"The review below was of the first four episodes and I'm happy to say Discovery has improved since the rather grim start. It's still dark but the characters are developing nicely and some intriguing story lines have been introduced. I would still like a little more light to balance the shadow as it remains a show I couldn't enjoy with the family and that for me was always one of the most enjoyable aspects of star trek.

-----

I grew up watching endless re-runs of the original series with my Dad and then fell in love with TNG as an idealistic young woman. There was so much hope and humour in those shows that meant they were perfect for family viewing. These days, sci fi is all dark and dystopian and, it has to be said, often fairly depressing. I can't imagine a kid enjoying watching Evan Rachel Wood get raped in Westworld or understanding what on earth is going on with Discovery. I do hope it will improve but after a long day the last thing I want to do is curl up on the sofa with a miserable death fest in which lots of innocent people die, populated by people you don't care for.

Star Trek was supposed to be about discovering new worlds and new civilisations not war, torture and death. No doubt that's why I'm enjoying The Orville a lot more right now which is a real throwback to the old days of saving the world optimism.",12 October 2017
"As a closet Trekkie I wasn't holding out much hope, especially since the end of original ideas and the introduction of the dreaded 'reboot' which now sends a shiver done my spine 😩

(that's not a dig at Kurtzman's numerous reboot writing credits, I suppose if the studios want reboots you do the best you can! .... I am actually pitching a script for a short film that centres on the Marvel/DC etc Universes being swallowed by a black hole never to be seen again! Lol) The End ..... Oh and don't get me started on the 'reboot of a reboot'. 😩😭😭

Anyway back to the point. .... this is a great example of taking ownership of a classic. Adding totally original story telling. Introducing great characters acted by an Amazing cast (it is a breath of fresh air not to be distracted by a gaggle of A-Listers). Also the decision to have a season long story arch rather than an anthology was spot on. And finally the continuity..... the links back to the original episodes and characters was spot on. Hats off to you ..... So to sum it up.. this is officially my new favourite hour of the week....

As you may have gathered I quite like this series!!!!! But then came the dreaded and happily anticipated announcement that there would be a second season ....... I wasn't holding out much hope after the disappointment of Westworld, True Detective, 13 Reasons Why etc. But how wrong was I. These writers are fantastic......

I have noticed that Season 3 has been green lighted so please please keep doing what your doing.

All that's left to say is thank you for making me and my TiVO box happy",19 April 2019

Ticks all the right boxes for the snowflake brigade.

Now I love sci fi/Spacey stuff. But I do not like star trek.

This is not Star trek which is a good thing.

Sure they teleport and have lasers but it is more then that. If someone's gonna die they die. No stupid choices and the actor miraculously lives.visually very good. Klingons look good. Good follow on story with little to no filler episodes. Definitely worth a watch. If it wasn't called Star Trek I would of watched it sooner.",17 December 2021
Season 1 and 2 were pretty good. Now this show has become completely unwatchable. What happened here. I have canceled my paramount plus subscription and no longer care to watch the rest of season 4.,10 December 2021
"Season 1 started well, it was slow but good. Season 2 was brilliant. The writing was very good and it never got boring. But Season 3 is the worst star trek I've ever watched and I've watched Voyager so that's saying something. The writing was terrible, it was boring, it never got started and don't get me started in the ""woke"" characters. It's set 900 years in the future and they could have done absolutely anything but it just didn't seem like it was set that far in the future. It seemed like they didn't have a clue what they were doing writing the script for Season 3. I would give Season 2 NINE stars and Season 3 ONE out of Ten.",29 March 2021
"Everything is so overacted, it's pure cringe watching this. I find myself skipping all the sentimental monologues and soapy dialogues, and that's quite a big chunk of every episode. I so wanted to like this but sadly it leaves me wanting.",7 November 2020
"With Star Trek, Gene Roddenberry created a universe of good will and accomplishment, a feat that lasted through the original series to ""ST: Enterprise"" (with Brannon Braga and Rick Berman honoring Roddenberry's legacy in the later series). The writing was mostly sharp and the characters were developed and believable, even when they were aliens from different, unimaginable worlds.

""ST: Discovery"" creators Bryan Fuller and Alex Kurtzman kick Roddenberry's (and Braga's and Berman's) values and beliefs to the side, providing patronage appointments to crummy actors and creating a dark, phony CGI world almost the antithesis of the Star Trek ethos.

Most egregious of the creators Fuller and Kurtzman's sins is the casting. In the Star Trek past, the viewer could identify with at least one of the characters in each series, who could take us along for the ride and make us believe we were on a great voyage in future space. Not here. Instead of Patrick Stewart being allowed to employ his British accent to great effect, the creators cast a British actor in the first year as a captain whose atrocious American accent makes his every line seem forced and almost comical. Another is the Emperor, whose accent is so hard to understand, I need subtitles to watch the show. Anthony Rapp as Stamets and Doug Jones as Saru are bland actors without any charisma. But the real disappointment is the casting of Mary Wiseman as Tilly, whose shaky voice/bad jokes shtick makes the whole cast seem like a bunch of community theater wannabes.

The stories are thin and the writing is too often trite, more soap opera than revelatory, more time-filling than plot-enriching. The light that illuminated previous Star Trek worlds has gone dark, so dark the ship is no longer the welcoming, pulse-inducing thrill that it was in the past. Unlike previous series, you no longer want to be part of the crew, to share in the adventures, go along for the ride. You are put on the outside looking in. And that's no fun.

Far from the altruistic world of Roddenberry, this series is dark, empty and smells of the quick buck.",17 November 2021
"I like emotive moments, and I have shed a tear or two over one or two lines by Michael Burnham, but does the sentimentality really need to get abusively corny to the point of inducing eye rolling or cringe?

Other than that, this show constantly jumps the shark with its far-fetched plot lines and gets you tired at the 5-minutes mark of any episode.

Production values are great, though. And a Black female protagonist is repulsive to right-wingers, so at least it has the added valued that you can enjoy their conservative tears and misoginystic whining about this show. I hope it lasts long, that it goes on to have many seasons. I just won't be watching it while it's written and acted like a daytime soap opera.",29 October 2020
"It has me hooked! After episode 3 I was eager to find out what happened in episode 4, now I've seen Episode 4 I want to see how it all unfolds in episode 5 and so on and so on.

Is it true to its 1960's counterpart? Hell no! Do I want it to be true when there is soo much more technologie and visual effects to be used ? HELL NO!

If you ever seen bad acting check the scene in twisted (S02) with Lt Baxter and Harry Kim ... After seeing that all future acting in every movie is worldclass",10 October 2017
"I am a Trekkie...that being said, the recent changes made to the ST universe have been both mesmerizing and outstanding to watch. From the 3 newest movies to STDiscovery, it has been nothing less than an excellent adventure watching an old dog get an overhaul that seems to have given it 1000 horsepower going forward.

I have greatly enjoyed the new look of STD, the changes in character styles, the new look of the Klingons(which should've looked this way to begin with imho), to the progressive story lines and grittiness of the universe they portray. What is not to like?

I love all the old Treks, but lets be open to what's really happening...It's a new world in reality, and even more-so in science fiction with the capabilities to do so much more today than they could in the past. Open your minds to the new adventure, new stories, new treks, and hang on for what continues to be a wild ride with STD! I immensely look forward to seeing where season 3 takes us after an awesome first two!",17 June 2019

"Although it's just a tv show not a religion, as another reviewer truthfully declared, it's important to say how great STD is, because for my part I would like to view as many good seasons of this show as possible. I would like also to tell to all those genuine but truly dissapointed Trek fans, for once in your life follow the motto of the original show and... go where no fan has gone before and start discovering new ideas and fresh story-lines. Don't let your inner fanatic ruin your fun and blind you. And, one last thing... The previous star trek tv series, Enterprise, was a great show too, but it seems was more than a handfull for the average trek fan to grasp that. Go figure! That's all folks. Live long and Prosper to everyone...",9 June 2018
"OK, season 1 was brilliant. Season 2 was very good then we got to season 3. It was all downhill from here. It just seems like they decided to make up any old stupid story and then get all the characters to be emotional to each other and hopefully people will just continue to watch iin the hope something good may happen. But having labourer through season 3 i can tell you it is not worth it. I have started into season 4 and only on episode 3 and can't go any further it is just unbelievable painful. I think I will just go onto YouTube and watch a review of the season and see if watching the upcoming season 5 will be worth it. Note, I gave it 6 stars because of the first 2 seasons but the rest would only be 2 stars. Truly disappointing 😞",27 December 2023
"It's probably the most expessively made high school quality drama I've ever encountered. There are usually about 1 or 2 minutes of interesting events or story per episode, occasionally an introduction to a new sci-fi tech, but the rest is just hyper emotional interpersonal drama between two or more of the many annoying characters. Often this diolog is occuring when the crew is in the middle of an emergency, or making way to assist in an emergency occuring somewhere else, or while leaving to conplete a mission that will determine the fate of the known universe, but first they make the time to stand in a circle and smile while sharing their feelings and validating each others fears and hugging.

It's a poorly made space opera with a huge budget for effects, very skilled CGI artists, and a Star Trek label it doesn't deserve to bare.

On the flip side, I really do like the opening credits.",15 March 2022
"I really liked what I saw. We have a range of possibilities presented in the first episodes. Dense and complex characters to develop various stories.

"I first enjoyed the series as its purpose was more or less clear: to introduce a new path for the original series. But as I watched the third episode of the 4th season, I realized that that particular path had ended long ago and the series had been on a new path, to which I didn't feel in tune any more, but wasn't sure why. It's now clear to me it's trying to send a message, a very strong message, not without its merits, sure, but a little to rainbows and unicorns for my sense of reality. Maybe another time, 900 years from now, in a parallel universe. Until then, dream on, no harm done. I choose to live.",16 January 2022
"I agree with most of the reviews here: I can't believe how not Star Trek this show is because of all the incompetent people who ""serve"" on the ship. 99% is totally unfit to be there.

I wrote in an earlier review (that apparantly didn't meet imdb standards to be posted, I guess they don't take criticism very well) that I find it very unbelievable that at the beginning of season 4 the show rated 7.1 and now after the last episode of S4 aired it still rates 7.1. How in the universe is that possible after reading all the (bad) reviews about S4? I guess the ratings for S4 are just ignored and not used for the overall rating!?

It makes me not trust imdb ratings anymore. Anyway, this review probably won't make it through but it feels good to write it anyway.",5 April 2022
Insulting and poorly writing with PC propaganda. Painfully hard to watch.,18 January 2019
"As someone unfamiliar with the previous Star Trek series, I am not going to compare Discovery to any other Star Trek shows/movies.

The first two episodes were more like a prologue, episode three can be considered the real pilot. Discovery starts with a strong premise and compelling characters and leaves plenty of room for some great character development. The acting is very good (shout out to Sonequa Martin-Green!) and I am loving the chemistry between the actors (especially Michael and Saru). The show is also visually stunning with great cinematography and CGI.

These first few episodes feel like the beginning of a much larger story and I am very excited to see more of it.

Don't pay attention to all the cry babies leaving one star ratings, give this show a chance and make your own opinion.",16 October 2017
"Finally a decent storyline in star trek! Best they made. Great action sequences. Lose the janky humor for actual good ones and you have one the top 3 tv shows at the moment! Good acting by the lead and the multiple personalities of michelle yeoh and leland as well (he should play 2face in the new batman imho)

Having that said some tips: Go in depth on the fighting skills and martial art they used. Not just fasers.. the vulcan have a connection to others the klingon insane strength use that. The sjw elements are also unnecessairy. Plus pls overhaul the transport ships they look like flying tupperware.",24 April 2019
"PLEASE DON'T LISTEN TO THE 1 STAR REVIEWS.

Holy damn, what's with all the 1 stars ? I wonder how many of those are Star Trek purists who base their opinions on something that started like, what, in the 70s ? and can't get over the fact that they based their lives and knowledge around a fantasy story about a crew exploring the universe, something that none of us will ever get to do. So, i get where you're coming from, but what the heck is wrong with you that you dare put this new story down ? You sick people, get the hell out of your basements and smell the roses.

Ok, rant over. if IMDB hasn't already banned me, all you need to know is that you can start watching Star Trek Discovery and I'm sure you'll like it, if you enjoy sci-fi of course.

Characters are likeable and believeable, props are mostly manufactured, so the aliens look more than believeable, the CGI is great and on point, cinematography is crazy good for a TV show, the acting can be improved in some cases, but definetly not an issue...

I don't know, for me it looks like a well put togheter show, something that a true Star Trek fan would make, someone who lives in the present and is able to adapt the universe in such a way that it can captivate new audiences who aren't 50 years old (!). It's a nice facelift for Star Trek, and I for one am always waiting for the new episode to come out.

Live long and prosper.",16 February 2019
"I'm a solid Star Trek fan, TOS and all the rest. This first episode of Discovery started weakly, the jovial banter seemed forced, but nearly all pilot shows, in any genre, are weak. I never judge a series by its pilot. Discovery shows great promise. I liked the Klingon character appearance. The advanced technology is good...it's what TOS would have done if they'd had the budget. I like the diverse people groups. I like the Captain and Number One. The weak beginning became a strong ending, with a conflict that I hadn't expected, especially in the pilot episode. I was a CBS subscriber before Discovery aired, but if I had not been...I would have subscribed just for this series. For the fans who bemoan the discontinuity and radical changes: I watch TV for the story's sake, not for canon's sake!",25 September 2017
"All these reviews saying it is bad are just plain wrong. First up, it has a plot, some hard dilemmas for the characters, and time for the characters to have depth and do some serious acting. It is not a episode of three buddy guys having an adventure.

For those who claim (very loudly) this a betrayal of Star Trek, I suggest you look at some of the better episodes of TOS. It was dark, and often the choices were very gray.

To the fun stuff. It looks lovely, and there is some lovely Star Trek touches. The phasers alone were enough to make me weep with joy. The titles, and music, were fresh but decently in theme (unlike Enterprise which never looked right, for all that I appreciated them trying something new).

Best of all, it grabbed me, I wanted more, I was genuinely surprised at some of the things that happened, and started to care for the characters (which are not particularly likable). It is possible to be critical, but look at the first season of Next Generation for a comparison. This is series has better starts than Next Generation, and is already head and shoulders above Enterprise. Personally I would rate it as good as Deep Space Nine, if not a shade better. I can only hope it carries on.

To all those posting horrid reviews, it is neither fair nor justifiable, and you guys are the reason we are struggling to get great Science Fiction made. Please review fairly and stop the ""OMG it's not what I want tear it to bits.""",9 October 2017
"Look ..I love star trek. The series and original films

Not quite sure what the next generation films were...!

But discovery I thought was ok ..loved seeing the enterprise at the end of season 1...giving pike some narrative yep

Spock no...it's wasted for discovery...or anything else. Spocks time is done.

People moaning about the tech etc. Get real folks tos was back in years past. Be realistic.

I like discovery.

Section 31 could be great but the lead character no",11 February 2019
"I am more a Star Wars fan than Star Trek, so take that into account. I like the overarching storyline and presence of Star Wars Vs Star treks drama driven plots like ""hue does a Klingon date a human"" and how does everyone FEEL about that. But I think TNG caused that theme change for her he show. Especially with flaky and laughable characters like Diana Troy (where she explains the whole plot jn feels like fashion because the episode is poorly written and visual effects can't explain it).

The original Star Trek was more action, open and close episodes that dealt with a real life issue or human experience in a way that allowed all audience members to ponder without being offended. I loved the original and still do.

Enterprise was hated in general, but I liked it because it took a step back towards the original movies but in series form.

Picard was great except for nextGen cameos. That actually detracted.

Discovery has little Star Trek feel about it. Almost purposely. A central facet of Star Trek was always hope. But this show tries to be dark and when it tries to course correct back towards hope, it is easy, convenient and often strained to close the loop.

The show also tries to be current and hip with real life themes in America, but does it so brashly and forced,...it forces an opinion rather than inspiring something to ponder. Season 1 is aggressive and the show doesn't let up in further seasons.

Insubordination by the main actress is a theme throughout the show. But her success or her being the only person in the universe to solve things propels her forward. It really feels like they tried to make a female Kirk, but the constant politics of her role makes the show less favorable.

And bizarre convenient answers to sum up a season build up grows old. But it's pandemic. So I keep watching.",2 January 2022
"Bad acting, not credible characters and just tragic. This smells of main stream production and the usual disgusting political correctness that ruins good source material in many movies/series. I guess the next series of the franchise stars a 15 year old admiral with a crew like the cast of Gossip Girls and gives us much of the same action as in the latter - but this time in space. I suggest revisiting TNG instead of wasting time on Discovery.",27 March 2022

"After Enterprise got axed in 2005 all of us were sitting without pants and even the 3 kelvin movies weren't more then a little consolation. Every other attempt to do what had to be done, failed miserably but this one, as dirty, menacing and dark as it is, get's the old wagon rolling again. It reminds me of the last episode of BSG, after they finally found earth. ""I don't know how we got here, but this is where we are gonna stay"".",29 March 2019
The production for this show is film production quality and beyond. I think it is even beyond the recent Star Trek movies. Every aspect is a level beyond anything done before it. Every episode is a masterpiece. I can't think of a single thing i can complain about. I hope this show lasts for a long time.,20 April 2019
"First, I am not a Trekkie, so I know nothing about the intricate ST universe.

Second, I am not a physicist, so I won't judge any of ""science"" in the show.

Third, I had zero expectations of this show. :-)

So I think all three facts really helped me enjoy this new ST-Discovery show.

I think the acting is good overall.

Some of the stories seem a little stupid, but I think they are good overall.

There are some things I hate about this show that I also hate in all other Science Fiction shows - namely the ugly aliens (like Klingons and some others).

Why can't everyone be pretty? It is fiction, damn it. :-)",27 November 2017
"But this series barely does the universe justice. Gene Roddenberry (RIP) had a vision and modern filmmakers have just butchered that vision. The series is watchable, but not genuinely star trek...",15 March 2019
"I enjoyed all the Star Trek series (with the exception of the pathetic animation series) This series has nothing to do with Star Trek. Everyone, esp. The main actress is very, very emotional all the time. Capt Janeway she is definitely not. And I can't blame the actress for all of it because she was quite decent in The Walking Dead. How is it possible that this show -who no one watches - gets season after season when much better shows get cancelled after one season. It's incomprehensible.",26 October 2021
I was put off by reviews but after watching all 3 seasons I was pleasantly surprised. If you're upset when black and gay people get movie roles or you're the biggest terkkie there is and nothing apart from the old show will be upto it then maybe it's 1* (that's the consensus from other reviews) but if you like impressive visuals and an interesting story around space I'm sure you'd enjoy.,12 June 2021
"I was excited to see a new Star Trek series and was doubly excited because it was shot in my hometown of Toronto. But watching the final product was a deflating and confusing experience.

This ""future"" is dark and depressing and this is supposed to be gritty reality baring its soul to an audience. The truth of the matter is ""reality"" is more re often beautiful, joyous and happy. Making a story dark and depressing is easy. Making a story that actually mirrors ""reality"" WILL have light and dark elements mixed together...just reflect upon the great stroyteller Shakespeare. Even in the darkst of his tales (Macbeth) there are ""knock, knock"" jokes. However, moments of believable levity, especially clever word play requires intelligent writing.

The Characters lack what made the original series clever, engaging, riveting and amusing. Besides the whole idealism of a positive future, the RELATIONSHIPS between characters (especially the captain and their immediate subordinates) MADE the original series GREAT entertainment. This series lacks a strong lead and lacks ANY interesting, morally redeemable, let alone engaging, even charming characters. The bromance of the original series made it genuinely touching and gave it an emotional core that this series COMPLETELY lacks.

The Klingons and their 10 minute unintelligible scenes in every episode are both hilariously bad and bizarre. The writers must have thought, ""let's make the enemy completely foreign and confusing and force the audience to be utterly mystified and tune out for washroom break.""

The only good aspect of the series is that all the money thown at it produced some cool looking cgi effects but I don't watch sci-fi to look at shiny objects. I watch sci-fi for great characters who exude charm, intelligence and make the future something to look forward to. I watch sci-fi for genuinely engaging storylines that make me think this could be Shakespeare in space. Even Shakespeare knew that you need stories with both high and low brow scenes. And even Shakespeare knew that sometimes you can write something completely fluffy and humourous and then later write something really dark. Surely we, 400 plus years after Shakespeare can say that we've learned something, ""in the future"" about good storytelling.",4 January 2019
"This show has great actors and incredible sets, but the storylines get bogged down with over the top emotional scenes and far too much detail in personal relationships. The amount of dialogue repeatedly spent making sure everyone knows beyond a shadow doubt that Lt. Cmdr Stamets and Dr. Culber are in a stable gay relationship (that is completely normal and 100% accepted by everyone in the future), especially in the first season, is so far beyond what is necessary that it actively becomes tiresome; and the number of moments when Michael Burnham reacts with extreme emotion to events is astonishingly inappropriate for someone supposedly raised in a Vulcan culture. Honestly, half of the characters have such extreme emotional insecurities that they probably shouldn't be allowed access to weapons or warp core technology. They certainly would fail the psychological exams necessary for command positions in a real situation.

This show has such promise and could achieve greatness, but they need to dial the emotional scenes back about three dozen notches, and for God's sake, stop making sure that everyone knows the sexual orientation of the characters (we get it, they're gay, and it doesn't matter to us until it gets in the way of the storyline), and please stop spending entire episodes dealing with the emotional insecurities of the characters.",8 February 2022

"If you got sick of Star Treks pointless plots, wooden characters, silted writing and predictable scenarios towards the end of it's second lifespan in the mid 2000's — you'll love Discovery.

It's a breath of fresh air. With real drama, tension and believable human characters, who make mistakes and aren't perfect.

Best of all, it addresses modern-day issues. Multiculturalism and the worries people have for their historic culture, the debate of racism and cultural expectations. All woven together in a sci-fi setting. Beautiful. Exactly what Star Trek should be.",25 September 2017
First few episodes blew me away amazing effects and pretty good story but I can't give something a 10 just cos it looks nice as it went on a bit it didn't get better or worse it kinda dragged but then the final episodes came on then the short Trek's and now season 2 and it's just getting better and better even a minor character on the bridge feels as likeable as chakotay or anyone really from Voyager it great watch it.,2 February 2019
"This is unlike any star trek series that has gone before it, I would not call this star trek by name, more like a average budget Syfy funded series.

Why change the Klingon's? it does not work they should remain the same they have for countless series and films.. this brought humor and entertainment to the franchise.

So we now have more modern looking ships, but the same stupid sound effects from the Kirk era? it does no flow

Have we not Learn't lessons from the recent films....Enough with the lens flares already!! they do not happen in real life unless filming towards the sun so why do we see them inside a ship.

Star trek went downhill with the enterprise series, this has furthered the decline, I would now rather watch a re-run of Babylon 5.

To me Voyager was the best star trek series, the perfect balance of story and humor.",5 October 2017
"Overall I'm happy with the story line, it's original, but I don't like how they push the whole gay/lesbian/genderneutral theme. There's nothing wrong with those people and they are genuinly great actors but the whole gender theme is so all over the place it's taking over the narrative, don't hire actors because of their sexuality, hire them because they are a good match for the series. Star Trek is about exploring the galaxy and this is rapidly heading in a completely different direction, please stop it.",17 March 2021
"I am long time, big fan of star trek. Love Strange new worlds. This particular series however should be buried as quickly as possible, delete all planned episodes. This show of unlikable whinny characters makes me ill to watch. Saru is the only interesting character that is part of this nonsense. Especially annoying: Adira and their michael jackson lookalike invisible friend.

Did i need to say more about how bad this is? The worst star trek ever produced...

I also can not watch anymore, .... I have tried to get it but really stop wasting time creating more of this drivel.. .I have said enough.",20 December 2022
"I think I was hooked by the second episode.

The first jarred my sensibilities and expectations, and - unlike some fans - I don't have a problem with being challenged. The lead isn't a noble-yet-slightly rebellious captain who can make their own rules; it's about an underling who takes unilateral action, completely correct and against the rules, and is defrocked for it, and suddenly all possibilities are now on the table.

People think the Federation has its noble purpose born into it - I sense this is more about how it comes to be. The Federation has always had the occasional dubious plan, the wrong step, possible invaders in their midst. That's the problem with Federations or Empires: to march to a common tune, you lose your individual humanity.

In many ways, Burnham is a microcosm of this. She's rigidly controlled, yet inside there still pulses a heartbeat of humanity that seeps out in more personal moments. She's raised in fire, given rules and then set out to test those in real life - much like the young Federation. In episode 3 she's given the chance to return to the machine but chooses the more honest path - It's going to be interesting to see how her better angels guide her.

Onto the naysayers.

Every ""Star Trek"" series has its early, rough start as it tries to dig a place for itself in the bedrock of Trek lore. I can remember the calls of ""heresy"" int he first years of The Next Generation from the purists who wanted another copy of their favourite Trek, TOS. Problem is, every generation expect something different now - which was your favourite? TOS, TNG? DS9? Voyager?? The movies (old or new cast)?? The argument is ridiculous to consider - there is no ""right"" Trek. They're ALL different parts of the same universe, so stop comparing!

Trek isn't bound by technology; it's wrapped in it but it's stories and the push of the ethos of Humanity into the cosmos is the core of the series. So there are holographic displays. So the ships look shiny and new..so what. Focus on the story - that's true Trekkie.",3 October 2017
Burnam really needs to get over her mommy issues because all the whining is becoming maudlin and tedious. Also she needs a new hairstyle because the kinky do-rag is a distraction. Otherwise it's great science fiction visually and thematically.,29 April 2019
"I don't mind that there is main focus on freedom of sexuality and orientation I just hate how it is main focus of who ever produced this... 90% of Starfleet and crew is unreliable, emotionally unstable, wreck of a teenager mindset, who needs to cry and express emotional distraction every second and after or before any action is crying or loong discussion how everyone is feeling.

Season one is horrible mess with so many changes to original design (Klingons are just... who came with this should be shot on spot).

Next season's got better just that whining stay all the same. It is like Beverly Hills in Space.

Some episodes are so hard to go through, but some are quite interesting especially last two seasons.

Honestly I am glad season 5 will be last. Hopefully they will focus on much better concepts like New Worlds which is amazingly good especially in comparison with this ...., pity Discovery will not be back.

Even Voyagers worst episodes are better than this.",17 March 2023

"I was unable to finish the first episode of the third season. I consider that I have given it more than a fair chance. Even though I like the visuals, the weak writing is just too much. It feels like it's shooting for complex emotions that simply cannot be induced to an audience by a show of this format. I can't say too much about the actors because I'm judging them through the script that they were given. It would be unfair. But I will have to give a nod to Sonequa Martin-Green's dedication to make all this work. Doug Jones is awesome in any role. He's lucky that way.",17 October 2020

"I had hopes that this series would showcase great story-telling. Instead, the narratives fell into predictable woke tropes faster than a tachyon particle. Simply avoid.",27 March 2022
"Before I watched the first episode I was not expecting it to become my most anticipated show of the week, I am very happy to have been wrong. The visuals are beautiful, the characters are complex and the plot extremely well structured. A lot of careful work has gone into the main character and it has clearly paid off as her actions and relationships with the other characters drives the plot forwards at warp speed, adding a refreshing approach to the Star Trek universe. A little more attention could be given to the relationship of other characters when she isn't around but that can be solved easily with time. My only major criticism is a complaint that this should have been applied to a post DS9 federation instead of retro-star trek, but they've done good things with the period they have approached",29 October 2017
"Leaving this with a 7/10 now mostly due to previous seasons. The direction of the show is not looking well to me.

Seems actors are loosing intrest in being part of the show, and seems to hardly invest any feeling or energy into a show that recently has become far to sentimental for no reason.

It's almost like watching a washed out tear dripping drama without any real drama to back up the emotion of the characters.

Please for the love of something change the direction and let the characters be more like curious explorers, and trained proffesionals rather than emotional teenagers in space!",22 November 2020
Show was great in first and second seasons. Season 3 started off ok but quickly went down hill. I tried watching an episode of season 4 and couldnt. Series injected woke nonsense and the script kept getting worse by the episode.

"This is not the formula of Star Trek as I know it, which was never really going anywhere as boldly from one generation to the next. Visually all the past Star Treks are on the same plate with ships, tech and environment kept at a minimum to the naturally bland and mundane every day colours and even though the tecno-babble got a bit out of hand sometimes there were always the crew dynamics to balance it out in the end. It was all very formulaic and it worked to endear you to the crew and missions and the mix provided you with a pretty solid experience with emphasis on story and dialogue. Action was.. well.. it wasn't really something you watched for the action.. Besides they were all supposed to be wide-eyed explorers and thus it was always more substance than surface.

Star Trek Discovery is the first generation with a completely new set of producers, that probably just watched the last two Star Movies and thought that was the base of it, and it is on a completely different level in regards to visuals, choreography, action and background music. In the beginning it also seems like it dispense with everything that came before it with a blaze of cutesy action-flickness and CGI, but it returns gradually to higher standards. It's much more like a movie and much less like a daily show. Much more polish, CGI and shiny surfaces. Cinematographically it's much more like the last two Star Trek movies than any series before. Discovery makes Star Trek feel as if the budget got a lot bigger all of a sudden.. Like all the geeks got fired and replaced with a younger, more professional, calculated and streamlined crew..

I wasn't quite ready for it. I came with all my expectations and impressions in the footsteps of TNG, DS9, Voyager and the last two Star Trek Movies fresh in mind and I was expecting to see the same formula in action once again battlng moral concepts, dilemmas, conflicts and aliens from different perspectives.. I was really not prepared for the cutesy action-flickness with neither wits nor comic talent nor the totally nullified and mullified adaption of the soulless hairless Klingons. There were just so many zeros trailing each other into an atrociously binary string of doom, damnation and epic failures as I was watching this in the beginning.. Yep, I was really in the wrong mind at the wrong time, but I even though I feel the show start growing on me I still get yanked back to my initial impression on every Klingon encounter.

In the end it's like a bad habit.. You know it kills you, it makes you gasp, cough and spit blood, but there is a brief moment of joy which is unique, but there is also a queue of hairless people sputtering about how horrible it really is once the killing has begun that ruin the joy of it..

Despite everything else, the one thing that really ruins the experience of this Star Trek is the Klingon adaptation. In this version they are a strangely calm and domesticated, hairless and soulless Orc that speak a horribly distorted and muffled chop-mix of guttural sounds in a devastatingly slow and pain staking way.. Every Klingon scene is pure torture, that wipes the slate clean of everything you might have liked and that's just sad, because there is something to like. I feel the show growing on me, until that moment where I get yanked out of my dream world and into the Klingon mess again, with increasing frequency.

The show would really benefit from having a complete do-over of all the Klingon Scenes.. Not just audio, but hopefully and especially the speech, but the whole lot of it, because it's just bloody boring, useless and painful to watch and listen to. I love the good old violation and brutalization of English.. Not this neanderthal guttural spiritualism.

I would recommend it, but brace yourself and go easy on the beginning of it. Zapping away from the Klingons is recommended.",21 October 2017
"The two first episodes for this new Star Trek series delivers a lot.

The look and feel is a refreshing change and a huge leap forward compared to the stale environments we got used to in the previous series. We're not watching a cheap TV series here with 'cardboard' walls and fake flashing lights, we are experiencing a visual and audio feast that immerses the viewer into the Star Trek world like only the latest films have been able to (although I am not a fan of the JJ Abrams films I do give them credit for the visual reboot of the series). The CGI is worthy of a major Hollywood blockbuster film and the makeup is astounding (especially the Klingons).

The actors are strong. Michelle Yeoh and Sonequa Martin-Green deliver without sounding fake and we do feel that they are close friends. The dialogues are witty and refreshing. The other members of the cast seem genuine.

The fact that the Klingons have changed dramatically doesn't bother me. It is what is expected when a new Star Trek series/film is made... part of the quirks and fun of the Star Trek world.

The story-line is okay although it does contain some plot holes. I do feel that it was all a bit rushed and that the story would have benefited from being extended to 4 to 5 episodes in order to build up further the relationship between the Captain and her first officer as well as the intricacies of the Klingon tribal system. It all happens a bit too fast to be credible but I can forgive them given that as a TV series they needed to start with a blast.

One caveat about Discovery is how advanced the technology feels from TOS even though the story is supposed to take place before TOS. It doesn't make much sense.

Overall I am very pleased with these first 2 episodes of Discovery. They are gritty and smart. Great way to start anew. It gives me hope that they can repair the damage done by the ""Enterprise"" series which hit rock bottom for me.",25 September 2017

Political consequences the savagery of mankind and how change will not come immediatley. Like the faith aspect though they should explore that more.

In short a lot of potential untapped. Still good series. There is a lot of crap nowadays.",24 April 2019
"The acting is mildly horrendous. I will be open I am only a fan of the original 1967 series, and the first two Abraham's reboots despite plagiarizing Kahn, and just a disgrace to Ricardo Montalbom's memory. I'm also wondering why girl power translates to the absence of men. Also if this takes place prior to the original series, Kirk was the first to encounter Romulans and Klingons... I'm trying to push through this but there's been no unique charismatic attacking or even anything interesting like a ""Data"". Now why someone sentenced to life (for if it had been a successful mutiny would have prevented a tremendous amount of death) is on a crew is beyond comprehension. This acting is so flat with no character buildup I don't think like at the end of the second episode half the ship is blown apart...the Admiral got blown to hell. Now there's a protagonist getting treated like the dork in school on the new Discovery ship. It's not flowing at all",1 March 2021
"Fair or unfair to say, Trekkies may not have a lot of experience with women, so maybe complex strong women scare them. Much of the hate for this show is directed at the lead character. Listen, Weinstein and the #metoo movement is the first real public movemnt for female empowerment in the entertainment industry, but that is a battle that has been silently fought for decades. So this renewed outcry over strong female driven storyline's and protagonists is getting boring. I remember there was the same amount of vitriol directed at Catherine Janeway when Voyager started, and now she is a much loved character. Anyway, compared to Picard this is an outstanding Star Trek, yes!! Even with the women :)",27 February 2020
It's almost unwatchable. You don't have to move the camera continuously and get worse if there is action. And there is no reason for a TV show to bot be 16 9 like every tv on earth now.

And I found it way more enjoyable than Enterprise. I couldn't make it through even 5 episodes of that series. If you go into it expecting it to be the same as TOS or TNG, or even DS9, then you're going to be disappointed. Just watch it as it's own story, as an addition to the other interpretations and it's not bad. My BIGGEST complaint is that you have to pay a regular broadcast network in order to watch it. CBS has more than enough money already I'm sure.",19 August 2018
"Season 1 started out okay but was a little hard to get into initially. The language, intersectional social agenda, and flow were all an initial turn off and prevented it from feeling like Star Trek (intersectionalism was always a part of Star Trek but it came on overly strong and pushy initially in this one). We took a little hiatus because, although we enjoyed it, it wasn't great enough that we couldn't wait for the next episode. That changed about halfway through the first season. It got good and we really enjoyed it. The season finale was a little anticlimactic but still worth watching overall. Season 2 it excellent and feels like Star Trek! Season 2s directorial changes seemed to be the right choice as the show improved drastically. Looking forward to the 3rd season now",20 June 2019
"Fourth season is a disaster. Looks like Discovery is really lost in the future. Theme is unimpressive as well as overall acting. I am still trying to figure out why ""Michael Burnham"" has been speaking in the low pitch throughout; like whispering.

"I had to invent a drinking game just to watch this sorry excuse for a Trek show. They need to take the Star Trek name off this show. This ship of fools should never have made it out of Starfleet. Every episode drones on about feelings and emotions at the worst possible time. Not saying people shouldn't deal with feelings but really they need to pick better times like they did in TNG. The show should be about Discovering what is out there, if you need self Discovery do it on your own time not when you are in the middle of encountering a new species or tense stand-off with aliens. It has become such a distraction. Too many ""check the boxes"" each week. Please cancel this series and keep the writers away from Picard and Strange New Worlds. Don't screw that up!",13 March 2022
"It took two seasons to set the stage for a new Star Trek story. But it was worth it. Reviews didn't give the story time to get the pieces into place so that Discovery fit into the Star Trek universe. After a wonderful and exciting season two, now we know how it fits and where the show will go. I'm excited for what is in store for Discovery!",7 September 2019
"If you loved Star Trek you'll hate this. Characters speak in clichés and make ridiculous irrational decisions. Diversity is a great thing but this programme is actively discriminatory. The only ""human"" male character apart from some minor support roles is a paternalistic white middle aged male Admiral; the evil Klingons are of course all male. In fact the first Klingon contact made in 100 years is with a non gender recognisable Klingon in a heavily armoured space suit. It is assumed the Klingon character is male by the female first officer as she recalls the incident where she kills him/her after first trespassing into what is described as a Klingon holy site. Talk about intergalactic religious insensitivity and political correctness gone mad.

Beam me up Mx Scott.",8 October 2017
"It seems people either love or hate this new Revamp. Personally I think they have done a great job.

It is true that some purists won't like some discrepancies between the star trek canon history and this new series. And it would probably be my only complaint so far is that more research should have been done to include this new series into the timeline. It feels like it was kinda squished in there, however..

The cast is really good. One of the best things about star trek in the past was its casting. Rather than just picking good looking people, they went more for talent and character, and even by episode 4, I can see the chemistry emerging between the characters.

I've been talking to my trekky friends recently before the new series came out is that they needed to make it more realistic. One thing I couldn't stand about the old series, was that so few 'main' characters died, even facing impossible odds. Away team beams down 3 main characters and one un-named character, un-named character gets his by random energy beam. It was unrealistic. So far, the new Trek has defied this and with the exception of the main character Michael, I feel anything could happen to any of the other characters.

So far the story has me intrigued. Being aboard a science vessel means there is scope for many different situations to occur. So I am really looking forward to the next episode.

In saying this I still think Expanse is better, but only marginally.",15 October 2017
I absolutley love this new season of Star Trek Discovery. I am not sure who these scowling people are that are leaving bad reviews. Probably got stuck in the Seventies version of Star Trek. Times are achanging and for the better as far as I am concerned.,7 March 2019
"The amount of hate that is being shown to this show by people still living in their mothers basement is hilarious! No, it's not like the original series because, NEWSFLASH, it's 2017! These same Neanderthals were screaming about the technology in the Star Wars prequels looking better than that of the original trilogy! Sigh.

Overall the first 2 episodes have my attention and I can't wait to see more!",26 September 2017
"The first 2 seasons were enjoyable in the fact that it took a unique spin on the Star Trek universe, (no pun intended). However, the 3rd season was less than impressive (by comparison of the first 2), and the 4th season is downright awful! I genuinely wonder if the 4th season is being written by kids in school as an ""extra credit"" project.

I sincerely hope the showrunners find writers old enough to vote for the 5th season, ( if there even is one).",5 January 2022
"I have loved Star Trek from the very first episode of the original series. But this new attempt to reboot a classic is shameful. The idea is sound. The graphics/CGI OK. But the script is boring and the acting...well, it really isn't even acting. It's just some unknowns walking around green screen sets blurting out a relatively bland and boring script. The digital folks tried hard and in some cases the visuals are not all that bad. But I just can't watch it. I tried. I tried really hard to set aside any expectations but I just couldn't get through more than about 30 minutes of the first episode. And I have watched every show to date from the original to the films (good and bad) to Next Generation to Voyager and DS9 to Enterprise and on--all very watchable, even the bad or lame ones. This latest stuff just has no heart or life.",6 June 2018
Although this started out well and got a little lost in S2. It is now just a hot mess of wokeness.. Seams they are going out of their way to build characters with zero likeability.,10 March 2022
"*Firstly I'd like to say I've no problem with a black lead character, gay characters, women characters, or any other diversity...Star Trek has always been ""woke"". There is nothing new about that.*

Terrible, just terrible. A show from Star Wars fan who once knew a guy who saw a Trek movie. I'm not kidding, I heard this from one of his interviews!

Ret-conning the klingons after 60 years of canonical history was bad enough. But The Vulcan Hello? Why didn't this come up in Enterprise every time Archer encountered Klingons? You'd think T'Pol would have said something! Not to mention the Vulcan high command, who was basically in charge of Starfleet at the time.

The behavior of the crew is deplorable as well. A crew of adults acting like High School kids AT WORK; not to mention Starfleet is a military organization.

I'm sorry, but Discovery is not Star Trek...

Go watch Strange New Worlds, Prodigy, or Lower Decks instead :)",17 August 2019
"A beautiful, cinematic, morally ambiguous and yet inclusive Star Trek for modern times. The cast are brilliant and the twists genuinely clever. I'm less happy about this iteration of the Klingons. Perhaps it's just me, but there seems to be a racial and cultural element to them that is unacceptable.

There are more than a few reviews here that declare this Star Trek to not be Star Trek. Apparently some folks believe a franchise must follow its cookie-cutter siblings to be considered a legitimate member of the family. There are complaints that it is dark, dystopian... these words repeat over and over. Star Trek is expected by many to be sunny, optimistic and utopian. Because they maybe feel science fiction requires at least one happy warm pocket a viewer can hide in, snuggled away from a troubled reality. In which case, those past series are still there for them to enjoy. This, however, is a Star Trek for the 21st century, in which moral and political certainties are questioned. If the traditional power structures of the real world today are being dramatically restructuring, it seems to me extraordinary that anyone should expect a child of Gene Roddenberry not to reflect that.

It is not the greatest show on television right now by a long shot. Is it better than a 7.4 rating on imdb? A star rating system, a point rating system, is the clunkiest way to assess anything. I've given this show eight, because I think you have to give some kind of rating for imdb to accept a review? But I've really enjoyed Discovery so far. I hope it continues and goes from strength to strength. I hope it at least addresses what I consider an unfortunate misstep.

By the way, should anyone think I'm being paid to write this, please let me assure you I am not. I was a theatre critic for fifteen years. I hope folks are willing to trust me when I say, nobody is getting rich off writing reviews on a website.",30 January 2018
Definitely not the worst. It's a series with some deficiencies and doesn't always stay true to the Star Trek universe. There's nice intrigue and betrayal which is a nice change,16 March 2019
"... solid follow up for the saga (unlike Picard)! I am not a fan of series that weighs heavily on on main plot (uncharacteristic of the Star Trek series as a whole), but as I have missed it - I take what I can get. The Captain is not the focus either - Michael is - and that is good as she is a well played character. However the captain needs to be developed more and so do other characters. It was the interaction of those that made the saga strong. Writers - wake up - don't miss the ""ship""!",18 October 2020
"I love this new interpretation of the Star Trek universe! I have been a long time fan of TOS, TNG, DSN, Voyager, and Enterprise series but have found the standard ""canon"" view start to grow limiting and stale. The ""rules"" of ""canon"" have limited the potential scope of new series and movies. Hence, J.J. Abrams ""alternate"" universe for the recent Star Trek movies. He and the writers needed to have fresh air, elbow room, and an uncluttered horizon to create new adventures and situations for the coming crews and characters to face and deal with. It's in this same vision that I put ST: Discovery. New styles, new characters, new possibilities, new bold horizons. A much needed shot in the arm for the the future of the Star Trek franchises. Viva la Discovery! :)",12 December 2017
"I think a of of the frustrated reviews are actually due to the change from Episodic to Serial structure in the series. The Original Series was definitely episodic, that is a new and separate story every episode. Even in the Voyager, they kept mostly to episodic. In the episodic structure, the 40-60 minute slot needs to introduce, develop and finish the story, so usually quite full. Unfortunately the Discovery producers seem to be short on stories, so what do they do? Find a story and stretch it to fill 14-15 episodes. This has several effect on the outcome: 1- Story progresses slowly, leading to frustration 2- What do you do to fill the 50 minutes? You fill it with melodrama. Perhaps half of the 50 minutes of some of the episodes is weepies... I bet i the next season we will see a lot of the characters being assassinated which is a classic 3rd, 4th season technique to prolong the suffering when there is a lack of creative story writing! Well, being a reasonably loyal trekkie, I will probably suffer through that too :-)",2 May 2020
"I know, when it comes to Star Trek, times have changed. In 1968 my Dad sat me in front of our black and white 12 inch TV to watch Star Trek, I was 5 years old at the time, and I haven't stopped watching. Not sure I would call myself and ""expert"" but I can say, I have watched the original series 20+ times, New Generation 10 times, Voyager 5 times, Enterprise 3 times, DS-9 1 times (yeah I know). With that said...

Discovery - I have no idea what this show is. But its NOT Star Trek. First, its focused on a SINGLE individual which is just weird. While I always thought the Ship and the Mission were always the KEY to the show, they play a minimum part in this show. I tried SO HARD to get into this show, but I ended up just bored. Everyone knows, writing is the key to ANY show, and this show just had BAD WRITERS. While Star Trek has always addressed issues of the day, they hid it in the story, for the viewer to spot it for themselves and think about it. This show HITS YOU OVER THE HEAD with it.

I have loved Star Trek for over 50 years... THIS is not Star Trek in ANY stretch of the imagination. The VIOLENCE is just so overblown and so much of it it overtakes almost every show. It's just bad writing and bad sci-fi. I gave it 4 stars for some of the pretty decent acting on the show, unfortunately, the writers couldn't take advantage of the talent they had.

By all means, watch the first few episodes...after 3, you will see how the story makes NO SENSE at all... if you continue to watch, that's on you...you have been warned. Watch Babylon 5 again.. it's a much better show.. heck, treat yourself to a real gem and watch the British Show, Red Dwarf - and get ready to LAUGH.",14 March 2023
"I very rarely write reviews on IMDB but as a long term sci-fi and Star Trek fan I cannot stand to see some of the critics for this show.

Honestly, it's well written, the actors are globally excellent, the special effects are crazy good. What's not to like? I am sick and tired of hard core geeks dismissing anything made after Captain Picard.

What is your deal? You don't like it, don't watch it. Rating it 1/10 is just ridiculous.

I feel like I should counterbalance all this hate and will give it a 10. In fairness I would give it at least 8.

I had a great time watching both first and second series.

Really look forward to a season 3!!!",21 April 2019
"I seriously enjoyed season 1 and most of season 2. Now season 3 we have spiraled into an emotional over acting wreck. Michael cries more than a 1 year old, the captaincy given to another emotional wreck. this has gone from a fun action show to a days of our lives in space. ,",31 December 2020
"This series is way too much about the crew's personal struggles. Really, it's just a daytime soap opera on a spaceship. I've lost interest after episode 3 of Season 2.",16 November 2021
"Liberal agenda achieved! The Michael Burnham character (Sonequa Martin-Green,) is so bad that it literally slaps all previous Star Trek writers, producers and actors right across the face.Her consutations with Sarek are a joke. I'm appalled that she was cast as a lead for this series. They should have named it Michael Burnham- Star Trek For The Me Generation. If this series continues, Mrs. Green, Bryan Fuller, Alex Kurtzman and the writers should read the reviews and fix this mess and kill her off before it gets cancelled. Michael needs to take one for team like she did in TWD...please I beg of you!",30 May 2020
"I love it! I love everything of it: the story, the drama, the connection to former Star Trek events, the psychotic captain, the struggling characters, the ships, the technology, the new looks of diverse species, the innovation, even the intro. EVERYTHING! It IS Star Trek, but on a whole new level! It is about war between The Federation and the Klingon Empire. (Like the Voyager was with the Borg. So, don't tell me about Star Wars adaption or any such BS!) It is hard, relentless, dirty. Kirk with his chauvinistic stage acting or Archer with his superior ""human"" standards and erratic behavior were a joke. This is a sucker punch! I hope it will go on forever.",1 December 2017
"I actually think it is a good series. People should get over the fact that this is not a direct continuation of the old start trek series. This story is good.

I don't understand why they blame Michael Burnham for the war in series 1 episode 2 though. By the way, I really like how she walks.",17 June 2020
"I was so happy when I saw a new Star Trek series is coming our way...and was somewhat disappointed with what I have seen the first (then second, then third) episode. I didn't like the title theme (and I still don't, sorry), I didn't like the (seemingly) main character Michael, and most of all didn't like the cruel, dark tone of the whole thing, along with much of the nonsense the show brought epiosde after episode.

However, it seems that it's worth to go through all that after all, as in episode 12, it all starts to come together, and much of the ridiculous (and sometime downright stupid) things start to make sense...to the point that I am now actually thinking that I will go back and watch some of the earlier episodes again (something I was never considering before). Maybe the writers planned this way all along, or maybe they just have listened to the feedback they got and changed course accordingly, but either way, it is much better now.

No, it is still not the flavour I go used from Star Trek of old, but core ST ideas and values are now starting to resurface again, so if it continues to go this way, it will be a worthy addition of the ST universe (at least in my opinion). Fingers crossed, and I am eager to se more.",25 January 2018
"I was delighted to find out that ""Star Trek"" would be returning to television. However, I was quite unhappy with the decision to make it exclusive to CBS All Access. By doing that, CBS has cut off quite a lot of the fans. As Spock said, ""The Needs of the Many outweigh the Needs of the Few, or the One."" I hope that they realize their error in time for Season 2.",22 July 2018
"I feel fellow Trekkies are being too harsh here. The first double episode of the TNG was pretty bad in hindsight. Also some of the TNG crew weren't what you could call pretty good actors but they grew into their characters. I have no idea why people are slating the special effects they were big budget cinema quality. I also have no issue with the story line it was introducing us to the characters with a bang. What better way to do this than with Klingons as the enemy? However there are a few ""eh?"" moments that the first couple of episodes could have done without. The Klingons didn't look or act like the Klingons we have become used to over the past 40 years. Canonically they're essentially Viking warriors. These new Klingons are more like Jihadis. Now you could let one indiscretion pass but this is supposed to be canon, in the main universe. So where did the Klingons get a cloaking device from? The Romulans didn't share that technology with them until 10 years later! What happened to the D7 battle cruiser? Their main ship looked more like Star Bug from Red Dwarf! Okay so they redesigned the Klingons to make them more threatening, we get it. But it doesn't stop there, holographic communications? That didn't occur in the main universe until the end of DS9. But again technology changes as does the real world, we get it. However for me the look of the universe was wrong, as mentioned the main ship in episode 1 and 2 seemed more advanced than Enterprise A and D. That's sacrilegious to many fans. The uniforms just didn't seem right to me, they were more like glitzy versions of the ones worn on the NX-01. They should really be more colour defined by the 2250's. Now Spock has an adopted human sister! But then he never really spoke about his family in TOS and we didn't find out about Sybok until ST5. Hmmm these indiscretions are building up eh? There're more indiscretions too many in my opinion. However I did enjoy the first double episode and it's nice to have a more cerebral Trek back on TV. I just hope they take notice of fans opinions and try to pull the show more in line with the canonical universe. Oh and I hope don't make the mistake Enterprise did of trying to bring in popular alien species that couldn't possibly have been met in that time period. It messes with the chronology and makes no sense. I'm optimistic as to where the show will go. I think other Trekkies should let the production company know how they feel about what is right and what is wrong. Before writing the show off completely. You never know they may listen and we could end up with another classic series.",25 September 2017
"This is a major abomination of all that his Gene Roddenberry's vision of Star Trek. From the character costumes/make up to the plot lines of individual episodes.

I personally feel they should have just called this something else and changed the alien species' names. I dunno, I just found the series bland and not true to the Star Trek universe. But I'm sure this will appeal to a more ""modern"" audience. And it's not badly acted.

So yeah- not the worst, but certainly not the best. I suggest people go back to the O. G series like TNG, DS9 and Voyager to be reminded of what the franchise is about.",30 December 2022
"I cannot believe all these ""purists"" writing so negatively about this show. For me it was one of the better versions. I liked the continuing storyline, the acting was great and so was the photography. Just very entertaining to watch.",15 September 2018
"Discovery seems to be really polarizing, and apparently gets a lot of hate for either not being ""real"" Trek or being too ""woke."" I don't really care about any of that. I'm OK with a show going where Trek hasn't gone before. But it's a shame that the writing couldn't be more consistent. I also see that most people seem to prefer the first two seasons and then think the show dropped a lot in quality after that. I must really disagree.

In fact I can't really single out any season for being markedly better or worse than the others because there's so much inconsistency within each season. Each one has some really stand-out episodes with good ideas and some good characters. And then everything gets derailed by idiotic decisions, ham-fisted and overly dramatic dialog, actors that seem to have exactly one emotion that they're capable of expressing. The show makes a play for being darker and more serious than other Treks with really mixed results. Often the violence feels excessive and out of place. The drama and personal problems range from well done to feeling really forced. While there are some excellent characters, there are also a lot of people who you see repeatedly but it's difficult to even remember their names because the show doesn't care about them at all.

Which brings me to Sonequa Martin-Green. I think she's capable of being a really good actress. I liked her in The Walking Dead. But her acting in this show is legitimately difficult to watch at times, and that's a problem because the show inevitably ends up being mostly about her. Especially in the first three seasons, you will probably see her unfurrow her brow a total of three times. It's not an exaggeration to say that almost every speaking line she has is read as though she's desperately pleading with whoever she's speaking to. When she's not doing that, she's either crying or whispering. There's even a scene where she's giving a eulogy with an entire crew in attendance and she's whispering half of it so softly that there's no way anyone there would have been able to hear what she's saying. The whole thing seems so ridiculous, and it's not an anomalous scene. The writers also have this annoying penchant for reminding us how flawed she is yet simultaneously acting like these flaws are actually strengths. I wish I couldn't say this, but she's the focal point of the show and also maybe its worst character. In fairness, these things do improve in season 4, but at that point it's difficult to begin liking her.

In spite of all this, the show is watchable. I didn't hate it as much as I kind of felt like I wanted to at times. The production values are really good. There are some excellent episodes and cool characters with interesting arcs. It's almost worth watching for Michelle Yeoh alone. I would say it's an improvement over the rebooted film franchise but not as good as most of the other shows in the Trek canon - definitely not as good as TNG, the original series, DS9, or Enterprise... maybe about even with Voyager, but even that I would probably put ahead of it.",30 December 2023

"After watching the 1st episode of Discovery which was broadcast over the air, I'm not surprised to see all the negative reviews. As is often typical in ""reboots"", in an effort to make everything bigger and better, it's just change for change sake. From the Klingon redesign, to the various (sometimes laughable) uniforms, the aliens as well as the cast dialog and interactions, I had no desire to watch another episode - let alone pay for it. I've watched every Star Trek series from the original on and although some series were better than others, this one is a joke. Seems to be yet another instance of the bean counters overseeing the creative process. Congrats on killing a 50 year franchise.",28 January 2018
"I've been a Star Trek fan since it all began and I just don't understand what all the complaints are about here. Just finished watching the finale of season 3 and was on the edge of my seat half the time and tearing up with emotion the other half. Personally, I like shows that do this for me. I call this entertainment. This show effectively builds upon what has come before in the Star Trek universe, in this instance told through the story of Burnham. Many themes are covered- women in positions of power, the full acceptance of humans and aliens irrespective of their color, appearance, etc., and that there are still good people in the universe, willing to sacrifice themselves to save others. And some well-deserved romance for Burnham. Season 4 can't come soon enough. Bravo to the actors, writers, directors and everyone else for a job well done.",9 January 2021
"I dont get all the low scores - I can understand it after maybe watching 1 or 2 episodes, because its not slow on action but the story line is quite deep and emerges over the Episodes bit by bit. Having just watched ep 13 I think its really awesome and they have the potential to do all sorts of things with the series. they have brought it right up to date and I hope its sees many seasons.",29 January 2018
"Yes, the first 2 seasons were better. The third is still interesting, but far too much drama, too much Michael focus who is having too much sad puppy face. It would do good to the show if Micheal would get out of the picture entirely and the story goes on with the others. The crying nerdie-babies here are bad, not the show. So please more seasons, with less Michael",9 January 2021
"I was as most are waiting for the new series...and have mixed reactions thus far. Although i applaud the attempt to use so much Klingon language in this series, it is very tiring to listen to and also difficult to have to read the subtitles constantly when your eyes want to wander and take in the special effects. The intro was somewhat weak - and seemed a very distinct rip-off the Bond movies intros. I love Jason Isaacs as an actor, but WHY are they having him speak with a southern US accent? he has a wonderful accent of his own - let him speak with his normal voice. Also not sure i like his personality as a captain thus far, unless of course you are going to kill him off end of the season and replace him with Sonequa. Sonequa Martin-Green and Doug Jones are wonderful, and the secondary cast as okay thus far. Mary Wiseman is a bit weak - not sure what they are trying to do with her character yet, and Anthony Rapp is okay - but if he is supposed to be gay, show his husband on the series. No one on board as of yet has shown any connection to family or relationships..very two dimensional characters thus far with the exception of Michael Burnham. Hopefully the stories will get more interesting and characters fleshed out. Please bring Michelle Yeoh back in some form - a clone or klingon clone experiment. she is too good to lose from the series. Cheers. Live long and prosper (hopefully)!!",9 October 2017

"I am commenting on Season 4. The shows written by Anne Cofell Saunders and Terri Hughes Burton are the worst. Talky, talky, talky. Express feelings, feelings, feelings. Episodes proceed slowly, go nowhere. There is a season-long story arc, but no episode proceeds very far along in that grand story. There are way too many characters, and almost every episode stops dead to make sure that a number of minor characters get their moments to explain what they are feeling right now. The worst is when there is a real emergency, but no urgency.",7 March 2022
"I've been a Star Trek fan for almost all of my life now (that's since the late seventies - so long ago I can't even remember the year) so I approached this new incarnation of Star Trek with excitement mingled with a lot of trepidation. I needn't have worried - it's really good. I'm going to stick my neck out and put myself in the firing line and say that, of all the Star Trek series from The Next Generation onwards this is the one that comes closest to the feel of the original series. It's got just the right balance of action-adventure, thoughtfulness, characterization and drama. And it's well acted and written. Well done to everyone involved. If it continues like this then I'll be a fan.",26 September 2017
"I wasn't a big fan of Star Trek: Discovery focusing on a single person. I didn't like Picard for that as well, but at least what was done there is that Picard wasn't respected by the fleet, but had ego boosted over the years to ignore that. Here we have very Mary Sueish character that pulls everything with ease, be it charisma, intelligence, wisdom, fighting or anything. Quite annoying.

It's season 4 where we finally often see actual teamwork, but still through the series it's mostly about a main hero disobeying orders, yet always being forgiven. We also slowly find out more about the team, in comparison to the horrible season 1, where even by the end most characters on the bridge were still strangers to the viewer. She also often acts as she's more important than anyone, sometimes it's the case, but mostly it's annoying humble bragging, e.g. complaining about how everyone relies on her, when it's not the case anymore.

From the perspective of graphics and cinematics, this Star Trek is the best so far. Finally, aliens may look more alien. Klingon's outlook was changed, but it's for better.

From the point of story, finally season 4 started telling a new story, instead of another prequel with plotholes and inconsistencies. Overall it's not worse than the ones in the earlier Star Trek series (which had never been perfect, honestly saying).

I'm giving it 8/10, partially due to trying something different. Star Trek is about a discovery of the unknown, and this installment is quite a different thing for the franchise, in many aspects it's good.

Yet, PLEASE, stop abusing Michael's itching for adventures as the main storyline. Most of the stories could've been written without making it an awkward one-person show, but as a common effort, at least on decision-making. The characters ARE charismatic, but the balance of them is not yet here. Pilot may suggest a course, scientists may refuse the commander's plan due their analysis, etc.",20 November 2020

Then years go by and you get an invitation to a concert by that friend and you're all excited because it's been years and they must've put that passion to good use.

And then it's just them playing Guitar Hero on a fancy stage and still missing a lot of notes.

You try telling yourself ""At least it's new songs."" But that brings little comfort and then it's three years later and you're mad and you hate everything.",4 March 2022
"Good Setting. Nice Effects. Very good quality for a season. I am very impressed and hope that Star Trek is getting to a new decade of story telling with this. I am looking forward for more. Yes, the first to episodes don't have to tell much story but as a ""kick off"" i think it has everything it needs for a star trek story... exploration, federation statements and a star ship battle.

This show was garbage in season one. Now it's like it's been reborn into what it should have been all along. People should skip season one and go right into season two with only a few plot point exceptions (no spoilers here) it is like a totally different show. Like a Star Trek show SHOULD be. It's like the culled the best of each series and updated the effects. Makes me think they should do a clean reboot of the original series with a new cast. It would be amazing.,22 February 2019
"The nasty hate filled reviews of Discovery fill my heart with sadness. How do people who claim to love the Star Trek series spout such vitriol? ""Star Trek is about a Federation where everyone gets on and tries to help each other. A more evolved form of human behaviour. This show is cr*p"". Like you can't even see the own contradiction in your own arguments? The people hating on this show don't seem to be able to get their reasons for hating it aligned. They're all different. The more honest ones mention PC culture and ""liberal agenda"". I think that probably speaks volumes. But as far as I remember Star Trek has always been PC and progressive, so what are these morons on about? The next thing I want to point out to those claiming the original series was better is, it got cancelled after 2 seasons. But was then thrown a life line for a 3rd season. People at the time neither got or liked it. So stating that Roddenberry would have agreed with any of the things the haters are claiming is completely wrong. Another thing I want to say is that have any of these people seen the first season of TNG? It was terrible, the special effects were none existent, the acting wooden and some of the concepts were bizarre. Such as Data having green skin or Geordie having to wear a visor. It's the 24th century for Gods sake, I'm sure they could have sorted Data's skin and Geordies eyes. Yet these inconsistencies are somehow now over looked as if they were somehow some great vision of the future. They really weren't. I suspect bigotry and generally being angry at the world Archie Bunker/Alf Garnet/Trump style is what's leading to all the hatred. Some of those posting the nasty comments and reviews really don't understand what Star Trek is or isn't and should stop claiming they do. There are over 700 episodes meaning Star Trek is different things to different people, it was always inclusive and representative as it could be, including homosexuality and racism. Discovery is no different. Does it have its issues? Yes, obviously the Klingons being one. But they appear to be attempting to rectify that in season two, just like earlier series had to change their direction, anyone remember the Kazon? The special effects and sound are cinema standard so to claim there's some sort of issue there is complete nonsense. I have followed Trek since the late 70's when it was uncool to watch it, I even went to the cinema to watch the Motion Picture in 79. Now that was pretty bad Trek. Discovery is head and shoulders above that movie out of the gate. I could go on for ages on this topic as a fervent Trekkie. They're never going to make another Next Generation because that was 30 years ago! Times and people change. Then you have those banging on about Discovery being a dark ship, err hello the NX-01 was pretty dark and chrome. And DS9 was darker than Discovery by a long mile. So to claim Star Trek was never dark is also false. Well I think I've made my point, just end it with the negativity and hatred, it's something no real Trekkie would embrace.",1 February 2019
"I really enjoyed the first 3 episodes of Discovery (where the series is up to at time of writing this review).

The visuals are stunning. Absolutely 10/10 for how Discovery looks. I really enjoyed the initial character development of the antagonist, Michael Burnham, to this point. She is conflicted but principled, driven but withdrawn. She is a fascinating character as is how she fits in with the people around her.

Without going into spoilers, she disobeys her captain by landing on an alien device instead of just doing the fly by she was ordered to do, and this is the beginning of a chain of events that sets up the show.

There were a couple of details that didn't make sense which knocked me out of my escapism. Something shining with the light of 1000 suns? No thanks, that's preposterous. There were occasional lines and dialogues that didn't work, and I don't think they did the best job with some of the Klingon scenes despite the brilliant set design and interesting re-imagining of the Klingons.

Overall very enjoyable, and it seemed a lot more grounded and generally balanced than the recent Star Trek films which I thought were vacuous populist action films with little regard for ever making sense or character development.",3 October 2017
"I thought the first season brought a great new impetus to the franchise. The first really adult spin - off; more violent, earthier language, a little more female - focussed, whilst still having some tenuous links to the original series.

Season 2 was even better, with Anson Mount just owning many of the episodes, with his wonderful interpretation of Cpt. Christopher Pike. Good seeing a young Spock too, even though there were difficulties in reconciling the Spock - Burnham relationship to the existing Star Trek canon. And what made these 2 seasons stand out, was the non - captain, central protagonist who also happened to be female.

Season 3 was OK. The concept of heading into the future and finding out about The Burn was imaginative, but did we really need the insert of the Tal/Gray relationship, which just felt forced and cheesy and better suited to some other show. Discovery already had plenty of diversified characters. I'd rather find out more about existing crew members such as Detmar the pilot, without introducing rather sappy new ones.

Season 4 is a definite comedown as many others have already cited on this forum. It's kind of like the Discovery TV version of the failed 1979 Star Trek: The Motion Picture reboot. You know what I mean. Starship crew facing overwhelming odds against a universal threat, talk, talk and talk some more. The series seems to be losing that edge it displayed in the first couple of seasons. We're served up an absolute minimum of action and a maximum of speeches. It didn't help that the ""villains"" were given almost too many redeeming features and that Burnham back as a captain was both a bit too derivative and bland.

I really hope the series can resurrect itself somewhat with Season 5 and I find myself happy in knowing that it is wrapping up at its end. Season 4 was ultimately quite disappointing.",3 June 2023
"ST:D has finally delivered a series that has all the depth and intricacies of real life, instead whatever that utopian bullshit was that previous series peddling.

"It is excellent to have another Star Trek television show in the television fold again. The characters are outstanding, the props and the CGI are a step ahead of the previous series television shows that bear the Star Trek name and the writing is superb! Not sure where all the hate comes from but you can tell these little fanboys have come over in droves from the Star Trek forum boards. These whiners are a true example of what's wrong with our society today. This is a very good TV show. Check it out for yourselves and don't listen to what the rest of the sheep are saying.",30 August 2018
"Some interesting stuff in the early seasons, but Season Four is unwatchable. And I have no problem with LGBTQ+ characters or storylines - but WHY, oh why must those characters be so fragile and weepy and ""sensitive""? I have a number of gay/trans/non-binary pals and almost without exception, they are tough as nails, having survived everything that the cis world can throw at them.

In short, where are the villains, the misinformed, the apathetic, the angry monsters? This show is now so concerned with ""understanding"" and ""connection"" that it's lost any concern for dramatic storytelling.

(Perhaps, most cringeworthy is when the two teenage characters ""smile"" at each other - the saccharine falseness makes my teeth hurt.)",16 December 2021
"Loving Discovery,

But find it humorous that each episode has no fewer than 19 people with a title of ""Producer""...

PROBLEM SOLVED!!! I am also watching the series, specifically season 3, with CLOSED CAPTIONING turned ON!! I can now READ what all the WHISPERING is about!!!

The DOWNSIDE for me is the actors cast in season 3/4. Blu del Barrio and Ian Alexander bring nothing to the roles of Adira and Gray. It has nothing to do with them being ""non-binary"" or trans, they just unable to show presence or believably in what their characters are trying to portray. I have no CLUE what target audience the producers were trying to appease with the casting effort, but these two are not it. It has nothing to do with identification - Jesse James Keitel knocked the character out of the PARK on Strange New Worlds; those two just... can't act. Or emote. The Adira/Gray story line just sucked so much oxygen out of the seasons. The two are supposed to be significant others, yet whenever there is a major... MAJOR emotional plot point, they resolve it with forced smiles and, at best, ""bro"" hugs. The writers had no clue what to do with them. None. I am so glad they got rid of Gray and put Adira into a sub-supporting role. Let the character evolve.",27 September 2020
"Yeah, I'm a little disappointed ..! Mabye the wrigther and produceres are trying to hard, i don´t know . The acting is pretty good . In Denmark we have something called ""Hygge"" ( Cozy) .. Maybe you've heard about it . I dont feel it sorry . The warm glow of candlelight is hygge. Cosying up with a loved one for a movie - that's hygge, too. And there's nothing more hygge than sitting around with friends and family, discussing the big and small things in life . I see a tv show that´s stressed . Like driving to fast on the highway ,- you cant enjoy the beautiful landscape pass by ..

Sorry - I'm really trying to love this show . And i will keep following . Mabye in time i will learn how to apreasiate the show ..

This show is different ..",16 March 2019
"Sadly, this show continues to spiral into a black hole. Michael performs yet another miracle against yet another galactic peril. Screw science. Forget about shields and tractor beams, we need a tether. Ludicrous! Everything is predictable nonsense. Utter crap. Andromeda was a better show than Discovery. What a shame.",26 November 2021

Loved this series. It's a great reinvention of a classic. Watch it and make up your own mind.,24 September 2018
"I think they tried to recreate the feel of the original Star Trek, but they miss the mark. The scripts are so simplistic and predictable and the overly emotional tone make it difficult to stay engaged. And the way everything is tidily wrapped up makes it almost cartoonish. It's almost a parody of the original. The great diversity of the cast and the top notch costumes and special effects are the saving grace of the show.",21 June 2022
"For the first time in any Star Trek TV series this one gives you rounded characters, good plot lines and great special effects. Previous series have always offered very two-dimensional heroes and villains - they were either all-in good or all-in evil, Discovery accepts that no-one is actually like that and you can even understand the Klingon motivations.

Yes, I am sure that there are purists who will complain that the Klingons' appearance has (again) been changed - but both the movies and the TV series have already done that so why shouldn't a new TV series ?

Previously I have also felt that the technology was really whatever was current with a flashing light added, but here I felt that I was truly looking at something from the future (and I know that I'm probably not, but 'suspension of disbelief' much ?).

Without any reservations I would recommend watching the series - put aside your prejudices and the po-faced ""don't mess with my Star Trek"" attitude, and enjoy perhaps the best space sci-fi TV series in a decade (or more).",13 December 2017
"Both intrigued and confused, as a Trekkie I find myself raising an eyebrow more than once watching Discovery. But truth be told, I am still watching. On the one hand, this isn't really Star Trek. Then again, in some strange way, it really is. It starts off as dark, gritty sci-fi, trying to mimic the recent Chris Pine-led films with lots of lens flare. It's all war, and no 'discovery', which means it doesn't feel like Star Trek. But they do boldly go into extreme scenario's that challenge the way we see the universe. In that sense, it is very trekkie.

Still, even after a few seasons, the title of the show seems poorly chosen. I still struggle to find this worthy of the name Star Trek. It's a good show, don't get me wrong. But most of the time, it's premise is all-out warfare or 'destruction of the universe' stuff. And while this is part of the Star Trek canon as well, Discovery just doesn't have much discovery or science at all. It does show great new cool tech, that sparks the imagination. But the name-sake mission of the spaceship never seems to start. Often, it's uneven too. Characters are at odds on the bridge in a very un-Trekkie manner at one point. And then get all mushy and teary eyed at each other just minutes later. And then there is the fact that most Star Trek fans were hoping for a new era to explore, not an origin story so close in its timeline to the original series, even if it does involve fan-favorite Spock.

Yet the story lines are a very good reflection of our times; a world on the brink of war with xenophobia issues, strong women leads, energy challenges, 'woke' relationships, the breaking down of institutions... the lot. In that regard, it is quintessentially Star Trek: a true commentary on us human beings in the now through sci-fi storytelling about our development in the future. And it is done very well: great costumes, special effects, strong acting, convincing sets and good setups for big story arcs. And just like in the older series, you end up forgiving the story quirks and cliches at some point, simply because you're applauding the boldness of it all.

The execution however, is an extremely mixed bag. Season two is a real highlight for instance. I was glued to the screen. But the series overall has a major flaw that cannot be overlooked: it's melodramatic. And not just a little bit. There is this constant hum of violins in the background, ready to burst into musical tears at the slightest twitch. It is beyond annoying, because it's always there. The story has no silent moments. And although the music is well composed, it is decidedly uncool: it's mostly just violins and cello, instead of some experimental new directions that would fit the series' boldness. It also feels like a copy of the recent films. In a two hour movie I can forgive the violins swelling once or twice too many. But in a series, it becomes a constant, and it takes away my own emotional decisions. I'm not kidding here; the music is so persistent and so loud in its attempts to coerce tears from my eyes, I basically dried up completely.

I'm a forgiving reviewer most of the time. But even I find this stuff is hard to forgive: don't they hear their own melodrama in the edit? They probably do, but the problem is: they're likely aiming for it. Because the music is not the only thing that is melodramatic. So is the acting. Don't get me wrong, the cast is excellent. But the directing simply is not. Especially the way our lead role Michael Bernam is directed is just not okay. She's always smiling a little bit too strained, or getting teary eyed a little bit too quickly... it's exhausting. Again, I repeat, that's not the actress itself (she's great), but the director instructing the actress into the overly sentimental. And she's not the only one being pushed way too far. Everybody seems to be on the verge of adolescent crying most of the time, all because they're directed to this. Coming from the excellent directing in the past, with actors who all knew when to hold back, this again feels decidedly not as Star Trek.

In the end, it is an entertaining watch. Why? Because its bold. Sure, I'm just as disappointed as the next fan that they're not exploring a new era. I hope next time, they do. But as a stand alone series, I must admit, it shines very brightly in its new darker tone. And the more you see this as a stand alone series, the less annoyed you'll be at its very un-trekkie moves. I find myself giving it the benefit of the doubt every time. So should you probably.

But I do feel that for me personally, there will come a moment, when I'm done with all this new melodrama.",3 October 2017
"I had quite low expectations for the show and I was quite surprised! Let's start with the good which is superb acting, some pretty cool plot twists, a good action and decent visuals... People were mostly worried it would be a non Star Trek Story under Star Trek brand, but it is not... It is a very much Star Trek from what I've seen so far, but there comes some bad... I don't know how they came up with this Klingon Race redesign...The language is Klingon, but everything else feels like a different race altogether from looks to ship designs... I'd say I liked very few Bird of Prey designs in the past, but in this Star Trek prequel their designs are much more bland...",25 September 2017
"Why is there so much crying on this show? The central character starts off with a sort of dispassionate Vulcan stoicism and ends up crying at the drop of a hat. I don't think starship captains should be this emotional, Janeway wasn't, she was a leader.

"Really-seriously I simply cannot believe some of review bomber's trying to leave some quite brutal comments here? Star Trek Discovery does Not deserve all of these negatives. And I would like to remind many of these so-called diehard Trekkie fans of the totally diabolical reviews that were said about Star Trek Enterprise. Honestly, the people leaving bad reviews are just Not true fans. But they are incredibly delusional. When in fact, Discovery will inevitably be picked up for a third Season - obviously.

Star Trek Discovery is much more than just a reboot. It is absolutely incredible. Hands down. It is the very best Sci-Fi fantasy Tv show in the World, right now. Only The Expanse and Lost in Space come close.

Also.... Anyone comparing Discovery to The Orville is an idiot. Really? That 2nd Season of the Orville is just so badly written. It's awful.

Discovery is getting better and better.

I find it very weird that trolls and review bomber's have absolutely nothing better to do with their time. Than to review shows that they clearly have zero interest in, and quite clearly hate?

Star Trek Discovery is absolutely brilliant!!!",13 April 2019
"The stories are complex and even with a few surprising plot twists. But overly dramatic, rushed and woke to the point of silliness. This is not a classic Star Trek experience. If anything, it might have wider appeal, but will less charm and vision than the original series. Feels like Star Trek meets ER and terminator. Might plot the franchise on a new path to success. Though it does feel very generic and could be lost amongst the myriad of science fiction stories it tries to co-opt.",16 October 2020
"The first season was too confusing. The 2nd was much better and I had given it a ""9"" until I noticed that in every episode where someone says that Burnham needs to let that person die in order to save the universe and it has to be done immediately, she takes so much time crying and trying to find other solutions that I was yelling at her on the screen to give it up,",11 February 2020
"Season 3, episode 1 continues where the previous season ended, sort of. The Burnham story continues with new characters and planet added. Special effects dominate the entire series and continues.

Otherwise, the storyline is similar with shallow threads going everywhere.",23 October 2020

Season 3 REALLY kicks the agenda into overdrive under the guise of the Federation values.

"TLDR: If you like watching people break down and cry, scream and OVERact like an emotionally wrecked 15 year old literally HALF the time in EVERY episode... then this show is for you.

Cringe is the right word to describe the show. I am a long time star trek fan. Not hard core or ""there from the beginning"", but TNG was on when I was like 7 and I've watched TNG, Voyager, DS9 multiple times over and Enterprise once or twice.

The good parts are... its Star Trek. The FX are good but actually TOO polished and too over the top. But over the top is what describes the rest of the show.

The writing is WEAK. They pretty much cover every single writer's cliché for any and every situation. Like grade 7 English class caliber writing and the most predictable outcomes ever. The writing starts out weak and actually gets worse as the show goes on. Considerably worse... there is ONE single twist in the entire show that is actually decent. The rest very poorly done and very uninteresting.

Now the older school Star Treks were not known for their top tier writing or acting but they are also a product of their time. Television shows have been on par or even beyond movies in popularity lately. The production quality, acting and writing in shows like Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul...even the Expanse is well beyond what we saw in the 90's and 2000's... hell The Last Ship has much much better writing than this show.

But the main character is the definition of over-acting. Omg she is so annoying I had to stop watching the show.. I just hard stopped Season 3 episode 1. She cries.. like BALLS her eyes out in EVERY SINGLE EPISODE. I'm not kidding or exaggerating. There's sappy dumb goodbyes in every episode as well. I legit got a headache from rolling my eyes and didnt realize it at first... every single episode she screams AND cries, AND over reacts. I can't believe it. Like someone had to watch this and after 3 episodes be like ""uhm.... is she gona cry for 5 mins in every episode?"" ... yes. The answer is yes.

Its SO BORING!!!! Then when shes excited about something or serious.... its like high school drama class.... the acting is terrible. Not like Shatner hilarious terrible or Jonathan Frakes reacting to 90's effects terrible.. but actually BAD acting and BAD over acting. Not just the main char but shes by far the worst... the side characters too... The one girl I guess they want to get across she has ADHD or something cuz shes talks a mile a min and is crazy excitable. But not in the believable way... plus she never calms down. There is ZERO character development in three seasons.... i dont know how in 2022 filmmakers and writers dont understand that a char crying and shouting doesn't equal ""development"". The only character who's acting and character ACTUALLY progresses and is believable is Saru, but he doesnt get enough screen time or progression to save the show... not even close.

The directing is decent but not good enough to save it from its own writing which really goes nowhere.. it goes in circles a LOT. I mean A LOT. Watch DS9 or Voyager and it starts out a bit cringey too... but as it goes on despite the quirky and sometimes over acting from some key chars.. the overall story builds and the chars are likable. This show.... the story never builds. Its all just like events that fire off and youre like.. ""oh ok"". And then the chars do something but never actually experience any loss or learn anything. In fact, every char other than Saru plays out exactly like an entitled 17 year old at every step of the way. Its just unbelievable how bad it is.

I sat through 2 full seasons just now and had to shut it off in the first episode of the 3rd when the over acting happens literally.. within the first 2 mins and doesnt let up. Now I'm ranting to vent the frustration. So crappy they got a huge budget and rights to the IP and they go and toss it into a black hole.

What an epic failure. Imagine Picard or Janeway full on crying every single episode over nonsense. Like fully trained Starfleet officers of the highest rankings acting like emotionally cringey teens. I wish Q was real and could just rest the timeline to where this show was never thought of.",4 April 2022
"Well I wouldn't describe my self as a Trekkie but I have watched pretty much the whole franchise since I was a kid coming home from school to watch Captain Kirk and Mr Spock. Although this series is visually attractive it just hasn't got any minerals, I can forgive a bit of shoddy acting or a not to convincing alien but this seriously lacks any serious thought to how a ship of any nature might be run, it's so unconvincing it hurts. Imagine a group of spoiled schools girls dress up and pretend to run a starship, imagine that they skipped every science and maths lesson at school and are now standing there squabbling about who is going to fly the space ship, well this is what you are going to get.Feels like a very very weak social justice warrior version of star trek.",1 October 2017
"I look forward every week to this show. It's so exciting, gritty and rough. You read all these whiney reviews from legacy Trek fans complaining how it's not the same as previous Trek series - so what? Why does it have to be? At some point in the timeline, surely times were gritty, times were tough. This is this timeline and this is this story. I find that this series takes from the tone of the first 2 reboot movies, which I also loved.

What if Star Wars and Star Trek were combined? I'd like to see that show - and that's what Star Trek Discovery is. Bravo.",20 November 2017
"I do like all the ST series and films, so I was blown away and impressed by the new series take vamped up for 21st century Trek fan generation - fantastic characters, developments and design that definitely doesn't stray from the concept and storylines for the future. While the diversity of characters is great (which many seem fixated on as the premise of the revamp), the series offers so much more than just that: the plot development in its own right, the themes developing staying true to the concept, innovative development of story bites we've got in previous Star Trek series in the future, bearing in mind this is an earlier history on the timeline (Enterprise is the exception). The writers certainly honoured much of it with continuity considerations while adding some new elements. I love that it's modernised in line with latest entertainment, and I think this modernisation unfortunately is rejected by some Trek fans who hold onto the sentiment of nostalgia of previous times despite it being well designed within ST themes fused with an awesome revamp for today's generation.

Every week I looked forward to the next episode to date, some of the twists in the end I couldn't wait for the next episode!

It's produced a number of awesome captain (and potentially future captain) characters that are in my top list now.

Looking forward to seeing what else is revealed in the next seasons!",25 October 2019
"The script is simple and too focused in drama-related situations. The main character, for example, has at least one emotional issue in every episode which can be worse because Sonequa's drama face can become... tough to digest.

"So much haters here of the new show i thought i was dreaming. I'm born in the '60s so i grew up with the Original Series. Watched them again last year in blu-ray and mmhh it was so much better when i was 10 years old and filled about the wonders of the series. Each decade a new series and i all loved them from the first till the last. But every series starts with difficulty, with robotic acting, awkward moments and so on. Encounter at farpoint, the first appearance of the Ferengi and so on, seeing it again it feels unnaturally but season by season you're dragged into it, you love the characters and they become family... Discovery isn't a correct follow up of the series, a lot is more advanced than ever Enterprise was but... clear you're mind, enjoy the ride and follow the strong character of Michael Burnham. It has been a long time space looked sexy again and in Belgium we need to w8 1 day longer to enjoy it on Netflix. You can't imagine for a fan from day 1 how long 24hrs can be. Give it time, don't flush it at start and give the team that build the show time to make it great or we will spend 10 years more without any good sf show.

I was even more thrilled after watching season 2, The haters keeps giving 1 star because they're blind and mindless because really if you never saw Star Trek before than you should give this space opera at least a 6 or 7. And ep13-14 of season 2 could have been a big budget Star Trek Movie that good was it.",4 October 2017
"Around the same time that this series debuted, a Star Trek parody THE ORVILLE came out. It had all the humour (via Seth MacFarlane) but none of the gravity. DISCOVERY was the bleak opposite. It had all the gravity but none of the humour. At the time, I preferred THE ORVILLE and, although I felt the series started strong (see my initial review), I gradually lost interest in it. But, recently, I decided to take another swing at DISCOVERY and binged all its 4 seasons to date. Although the show tried to swing a little less dark in its later seasons, this time, I was able to connect with its story arcs, its characters and its quality of production. (I will always be won over by relationships and good working ensembles and I would say these are the strengths of this series). It was an enjoyable 3 and a half day binge. I give this series a 7 (good) out of 10. {SciFi Legacy}",17 January 2022
"Been a Trekker since '66 when the original series aired. Discovery is awful:

The Good: Sonequa Martin-Green, Michelle Yeoh, Jason Issacs, Anson Mount, Special effects.

Hairless Klingons, The Enterprise, even that recognizable unique high pitch sound (you will know what I mean when you hear it) and a very sexy Spock are only a few treats. Discovery gives us a fiercely strong and united crew you will learn to adore. Some scenes have you on the edge of your seat. Every episode has the quality of a big picture movie. I am in awe. Looking forward to Season 3! not giving full 10 stars because I believe there is always room to grow. Fall in Love with Star Trek all over again.",2 June 2019
"Fantastic! Amazing! Pick any positive superlative and you will be right. It is that good. I'll be honest. I had my doubts. But WOW! Blown away. I was just a boy when the original Star Trek aired and I loved it. And with the exception of Voyager, I have been pretty happy with all the incarnations. So much has already been done in the past in the sci-fi arena my expectations were admittedly high. Yet with each episode of the first season, this production has sailed over the bar with ease. I can't wait for season 2. Ignore the haters. They're all living in the past.",30 January 2018
I have enjoyed every previous Star Trek series and was looking forward to this when it came out. At the time i herard so many bad reviews that i actually put off watching it. I decided to watch it now and am half way thru season one and it is even worse than i imagined. The characters have no personalities whatsoever and the stories never delve beyond the worse aspects of adventure genre...when they do attempt to do a story it basically retcons the entire star trek universe with an unbelievably silly warp drive powered by mushrooms spores and a bigfoot like character.....yes it is that awful.,30 January 2022
"I have always enjoyed sharing science fiction and particularly Star Trek with my family. Not this series. This makes me very sad. I've never had to fast forward past problematic scenes with any other series.

I love the premise for this version and the characters in it, but since when does Star Trek get into semi porn and gore/terror? I thought I was doing a pretty good forwarding past the scary and Human/Klingon sex scenes... but one evening we were going to watch a new episode and my 11 year old son (the biggest fan of my kids) asked if we could put it off to another day because it was too close to his bedtime and he had nightmares after the last episode. I had been telling myself it was okay up to that bit of honesty on his part. The gore (surgical modification of a Human/Klingon) was really in-needed. The sex scenes between that same human and a Klingon woman were totally ridiculous. In previous series all of these things were just hinted at with a kiss etc, and that was plenty for the bountifully-imaginative audience.

Please make the next season something the whole family can share again!!!!",17 February 2018
"What is going on with all the haters? I thought it was awesome! I thought it was imperative to write a review about this. It's my first IMDb review too.

This is me after watching the first episode and I have to say that so far I am impressed. This is a much better approach at the Star Trek universe than all the 'Next Generation' monster or social issue of the week drivel.

I am reserving judgement about the rest of the episodes but the first one was well shot, well directed and well acted.

My only complaint and this is a minor one and possibly unavoidable is of all the technical mumbo jumbo jargon. I guess they're too much of a staple of the Star Trek experience and they couldn't be entirely removed.

Either way I am very optimistic about this. Nice one Bryan Fuller, don't trust the rest of the showrunner crew but I trust you.",30 September 2017
"It breaks all the norms of Star Trek. And apparently it breaks all the lore.

But it was emotional, well acted and unpredictable. It kept you on the edge of your seat and I loved it.

I spent the first few episodes complaining that it wasn't really Star Trek, and then I got over it and enjoyed it for what it was. An incredibly well written show.",1 March 2018
"This is not an old, 'family' Star Trek nor it is another dumb JJ Abrams' movie. This series is honest and brutal, definately more realistic. It deals with real emotions, real sense of loss and disappointment and some real choices that have real consequences. It offers some real twists and turns that I didn't see coming. There is also some real humour there and nostalgia. The series is modern, modelled after our contemporary society and way of thinking, culture and values - it cannot be an 'old' Star Trek, because the world has changed. The acting is superb, especially the lead heroine, the guy who plays her love-interest and (bravo!) the male captain (Lorca). The lead is believable, full flesh-and-blood woman who has a real past that has defined her and her life-choices. She is very brave, but deep in her heart she is also very sensitive and afraid to fall in love. Actually I found the series only higher than average till approx. 7-8 episode when it really improved radically and became really interesting. I would have given it 9 if not for the lame finale (how they defeated the Klingons).",13 December 2018
"Buff for spaceship opera. Just delivers me what I want.

Good but not hard to guess storyline - check. ( Is it just me or the fall of empire = commenwealth from andromeda and spore drive = wormhole technology from farscape)

Fine actors - micheal and saru.. Check Comic delight - tilly, super check Visual effects - supercheck.

And Michell yeah = massive check.... Cherry on top.

I love it. Waiting and wanting more...",18 December 2020
"Firstly - I'm really enjoying this program.

If only they'd made it as a stand alone program without the Star Trek affiliation.

The characters are developing. Loving the starship.

But it's not Star Trek. This timeline's all wrong and the Klingons just aren't.",19 October 2017
"Up until this showed up, it was considered that Star Trek: Enterprise was the worst of the Trek shows. It was something even fans of Voyager could count on. Not that Voyager was necessarily a bad show but in the lineup of Trek, it was near the bottom.

So when I heard a new Trek show was coming out on Netflix I was interested. Okay, they have a female captain. I don't care, Voyager had a female captain and Kate Mulgrew did a fine job. Okay they were going to explore modern issues in the show. Not a problem. Star Trek has always tackled modern issues through their lens. Remember the Klingons? They were the Russians and the Federation were the Americans. Remember that planet where they were half black and half white, literally bisected down the front? That was racism as some were seen as being inferior because their colors were reversed.

And then came the first problem, the image of the Klingons. WTF happened? You took an established people with history, culture and personality and turned them into Orks. Gone was the warrior spirit and pride and in their place was... something else that just didn't make any sense. I can actually forgive the change in character design because of how the Klingons changed throughout the series and this was in a sense an attempt to come back to who they were before. But they took that idea, stomped on it, ground it into the dirt and pretended like it never existed.

This just isn't Star Trek. It's a space opera with lens flares, shaky cam and an agenda to normalize certain ideas. It's using the name of Star Trek for it's own purposes and it sucks.

If there's one redeeming light it's the fact that I've never paid to see an episode. I'm not signing up for another streaming service especially when this is the kind of show I'm going to expect. No thank you.",28 October 2018
Well I am now on Episode 3 of Star Trek Discovery on Netflix and I am still loving it . I am not sure what all the Star Trek super fans are worried about maybe my mind is more open than theirs .I am enjoying the CGI still and I really to find the lead character really interesting and pretty cool as well.Each episode is pretty fast paced and all those navel gazers out there in Star Trek geekland must be crying into their extra larged up sodas while they munch on their double whammy super dooper burgers !!Longing for those ultra boring episodes of the old Star Trek .. I love the new one a lot .. Tim,1 October 2017
"S04E02. I'm done. Complete and utter nonsense. I gave it 2 stars because a lot of people put in a lot of hard work to produce this show and at least 2 of them probably feel really bad about the end result, but hey, it's a job. So I gave them each a star as a token participation trophy.

Seriously, I could write any nonsense down here and it would be better than the script.",12 December 2021
"The most telling thing is I just don't get around to watching it anymore.

Lower decks has a few episodes that have good ratings which shows the fanbase are capable of coming around to something vastly different to what they were into. It kind of feels like they're just throwing whatever they can at a wall and seeing what works. That seems fine, but if it's the plan why not axe the stuff that doesn't work? Maybe this works for a niche, I've never met anyone who was super into it.

I assume the tax credits make this work financially. Thanks Canadian taxpayers for the science fiction filler content to pad out the CBS streaming service!",11 November 2020
"I am pretty sure I can recognize a Brigade when I see one. All of the negative reviews are unfair, and a lot of them... a lot, didn't seem to have even watched the show. I am not sure why this show is being brigaded, but I liked it quite a lot- and I watched both episodes.

I really liked Michelle Yeoh as the captain; she grew on me rapidly. Fortunately, according to an article I read, she will be a regular on the show; I am happy about that.

Since the male captain doesn't make his appearance until the third episode, I will have to wait and see on that, but given how great the rest of the cast is, I am optimistic about him.

I was really pleasantly surprised by the Klingons. Again, having read the reviews here, I was expecting them to be comical, but they were dark and serious and mean, and the cinematography helped capture their evilness. I am at a loss to see how anyone could complain about the Klingons in this show.

Yes, this cast is taken from the short story of a freshman social justice warrior in a beginning writing class at a liberal university, but who cares. Star Trek has always broken ground in these areas, and I really felt like they pulled it off admirably and seamlessly here. I almost wouldn't have noticed if not for all the complaining about it in other reviews.

The original Star Trek had the first interracial kiss on TV, and I bet the people complaining about the diverse cast are the kids and grand kids of the people who threw a fit when that interracial kiss first happened.

Overall, the tone leans to the darker more serious side, which I like a lot. The cinematography and CGI are great. I expected the make-up and uniforms to be cheesy and comical from other reviews, but they are not at all; they are really well done, especially the Klingons.

I definitely recommend this show. My rating is really an 8.5, but I went with a 9 to balance out all the fake reviews from the hate brigade.",30 September 2017
"Ok... first two episodes were weird and poor I have to admit. Maybe they were a bit piloty not sure. And yes there are some plot holes but what version of ST hasn't got any? This is science fiction not science reality.

Not sure what the haters hated. If they hated it so much why keep watching and posting bad reviews? What was to hate? Best CGi and graphics of any ST series, brilliant characters and actors. The best Spock since the original? Debatable but I think so. The story arcs were great and tight (in the end).

Can't wait for season 3!",30 August 2020
"This IS ""Star Trek"" - BUT REMEMBER: Discovery takes place 10 years *before* The Original Series, and *absolutely* many aspects of the Federation - such as its fully fleshed-out values system, expected and accepted behavior and motives, etc. (and thus that of TOS onward) have *not* had the chance to more fully evolve in practice yet. That is why you see such great differences between the characters and story lines in this series on the one hand and all other ST series on the other hand... the differences are intentional, willfull, and otherwise deliberate. To *not* have done it this way would have amounted to turning the franchise into a very old and tired one; instead, this series effectively rejuvenates it by placing it within much more broad context.",6 January 2018
"Whenever fandoms hold onto the old ideas of what they like they revolt at inevitable change. The show is adult, has darker themes and motivations and is not the Pollyanna of space that Gene Roddenberry first put out.

Star Trek TNG was enimic, boring and lacking in real issues which is what the OS took real chances with in the 60s.

This show at least treads new ground, new themes and looks great.",22 December 2018
"Series one had some issues, primarily not being 'Star Trek' enough, and I, like many others, gave up about halfway through. However, the show's producers appear to have taken notice of the fans and made some significant changes for the better. Series two is a much more recognisable Star Trek universe and the addition of Anson Mount as Christopher Pike has injected an energy into the whole venture. I was particularly pleased to see the similarities to the original Chris Pike. They've also toned down the romantic relationships which is a welcome relief, and hopefully this will continue with the focus on storylines. Its starting to look much more promising and having just finished episode five series two, I'm now looking forward to the rest of the series. I would urge everyone not to give up, and those who already have should perhaps give it another go.",17 February 2019
"TL;DR S1 - 8/10 S2 - 6/10 S3 - 3/10 S4 - dunno, Paramount tore their toys away from Netflix

Watch season 1 for some amazing Klingon characterization and endless talk. They speak Klingon all the time. Ever felt ST had not enough Klingons? Knock yourself out with S1. I loved S1.

Then it goes downhill. First slow, then really picks up the pace. Some more mushroom references, prevalent personal drama, feelings, feelings galore, everyone has FEELINGS about something and they have this URGE to express these every time they're on screen. Teenage, throwaway level of story telling, sort of knee-deep interest from writers in what they actually write about. Ultimately boring.

And the worst of it, what is it with America and American TV industry today? I don't get it, the level of PC in this show (and so many of them in recent years) is SO in your face that it becomes unbearable to watch (try S3 of New Amsterdam aswell, it's sickening). I am not an American, I understand you have racial/gender/equality issues (which is quite frankly totally riduculous in itself, but it's not the place and time), but for f..s sake, how do you even go around your productive day trying not to insult anyone. Everyone and his dog is INSULTED these days. By anything. Being white is insulting. Being nice to someone of a different skin color is insulting. God forbid you look at someone from an angle. You try to satisfy everyone, but somehow, everyone is mad anyway. Guys, you really need to take a step back and get rid of that fixation because it's making US TV shows really poor with writers focusing on some ridiculous political correctness issues instead of an interesting story and character development! It's 2022, who gives a damn about their skin color or sex preferences these days?

The most culturally and ethnically diverse country in the world is so fixated on being ""polite"" that their movies and TV start to reflect it in a very bad way. Don't. Just don't.

Sorry for the rant, but actually, I am not sorry - this is the current state of most US TV shows, so it's not an out of place rant.",24 March 2022
"As a fan of Star Trek since the reruns in the early 70s I can hand on heart say that season 2 of Discovery is not only the best of the STU franchises - but probably one of the best made-for-TV science fiction shows - ever.

I don't say that lightly. After season ones troubled history it was never certain that season two could salvage the production, but not only did it achieve that, it broke thr space time continuum!

Ground breaking CGI, passionate acting, a rock solid and mind bending story and countless respectful tributes to the original Star Trek came together to make a truly breathtaking experience.

If Star Trek Discovery doesn't win a planet full of awards there is no justice. As for those leaving sub par reviews - boldly go and watch something less intellectually stimulating!!

Congratulations to the cast and crew - this aging Star Trek fan is honoured to have shared your vision.",21 April 2019
"I am a Star Trek fan from away back - since watching the premier of STOS on NBC in 1966. I have enjoyed all the series and movies since. Some have been below standard and others surpassed expectations.

The thing about Discovery is that it is only fair Sci-Fi and is definitely not Star Trek. I kept waiting for it to evolve into something I'd recognize but it never has. It suffers from ridiculous story lines attempting to impersonate creativity.

It's packed with dialogue - with every episode based on some threat to the entire universe. There's nothing like those adventures fans got used to over fifty years. And it's stepped all over a history developed throughout those other series.

Discovery seems to take itself too seriously with everyone involved trying so hard to surpass other versions that they miss the mark entirely. I just hope that Star Trek Strange New Worlds sets its heading correctly because Discovery is way off course.",27 November 2021
"First of all, what made Star Trek enjoyable, inspirational and captured the audience is the journey! With the Spore-Drive this show removed that element and has destroyed Star Trek forever. For example, it took 7seasons for Voyages to get back to Earth and they had limitless possibilities to stumble across during their return would take 70 years, not a split second of teleportation.

Second, what made Star Trek great was character development. Having a handful of characters that relate to the audience which are developed over time is an essential element in Star Trek. Having 10-12 unique characters develop is the way to do it. Discovery has no character and the three they've developed so far don't deserve to be on the show!

Third, If Tully is supposed to be the ""funny"" in the show, it was made for ages 11-13. Staments is my least favorite, he's creepy, weird and ugly in every single way, I could rant descriptively for a while on how much he's ruined Star Trek. Burnham was never ""main-character"" material. She was never even all that good or interesting on a sub-par show like The Walking Dead turned into after Season 3. I will never be interested in Saru or Detmer.

Fourth, Klingon have always been the least interesting adversaries. I was always content with limited Klingons on the show. Nobody wants to watch Closed-Caption for no reason. It doesn't add flavor to the show. Romulans would have been better but that would have required intelligence the writers clearly do not have. The only interesting adversaries is the Borg and I'm glad you haven't ruined them yet with this show. Star Trek Enterprise might actually be better then this... That should say it all!

Summary, this show is all flash and fluff and no rich substance or content. it's truly a reflection of Millennial capabilities. Another fans hopes and expectations crushed.",5 April 2019
"Contrary of what you might believe from the title and the rate, I'm 60 and a papa and grandpa too. I just did not got ossified as all the 1 star reviewers. Original Star Trek was great, I loved it. But times are a-changing, people, can't you get it? The original was moral, altruistic, positive and projecting such a idyllic future of mankind! Think of it, a United Earth! What has it to do with Real Earth today? What has happen in the mean time? USSR exploding in pieces, Yugoslavia shredded, Sudan, Iraq, Syria in shambles, Catalonia braking from Spain, Brexit and Scotland on the path of secession. People are more divided and full of hate inside the same nation, look at USA split in 2 tribes, radicalization of parties and political opinions, alt-right and alt-left replacing the traditional right & left. The allegory of the ST Discovery is brilliant in this respect: an alternate universe where Terrans are the mean guys. Mean, nasty murderers. In opposition to the ""real"" Universe where humans are so weak in containing the enemy that they rely on a captain with a serious deficit of character and a mutineer as their last chance of survival. Not without flaws: the ""black matters"" approach is an unnecessary concession, especially when the actress chosen for the main character is not rising to the task. Zoe Saldana was too expensive I guess or too busy with Avatar 2 and anyway would have been dissonant with the rest of the casting, which is mediocre. The homosexual couple is more in place, with unexpected credibility added by the fact that the scientist was in the real life the object of the scandalous behavior of Kevin Spacey. The story is good though an deserves the time to watch it unfolding. Michael just found out that the man she loves is the mortal enemy submitted to an atrocious plastic surgery to transform him from Klingon and implant him a false personality. Brilliant, the Manchurian Candidate in an original interpretation!",11 February 2018
"Have to say I'm not a Star Trek fan at all, I enjoy them but I'm not a rabid cultist like some are. Have to say compared to some of the series (apart from next gen and DS9) this is much better than most especially the latest episode number 3 which I found actually very good. Don't know why some people hate this new series because it isn't like the old ones as it seems a little more ""grown up"" or grittier is probably a better word. Yes she needs to lose the self pity now but overall I'm happy with it.",3 October 2017
"The overall story arc is very satisfying and remarkably complex, but takes 2 entire seasons to unfold. Yes, it's all about Spock's sister ""Michael""... with Spock's own backstory as the subplot. Yes it's excessively melodramatic, but hey. - it is serialised space drama. However, if you can live through the interpersonal drama and some frustrating moments within individual episodes the overall story arc is truly impressive. By the time the strings are tied together at the end of the second season the grand vision of the larger story arc is revealed. This is remarkably complex. It also explains why the writers made some of their plot decisions that have caused frustration for some viewers - this was how they enabled the larger, complex story arc. If you can allow the writers a little flexibility and not nitpick details of the Star Trek universe the overall story arc is very satisfying. I would have been more satisfied with less interpersonal melodrama and less time on explosions and battle/bridge crisis scenes.",6 January 2020
"Firstly, WOW I am shocked reading some of the bad reviews. I dare say that these people are die hard trekies, that have the PJ's, the lunchbox, and have never left home.

I personally find the show entertaining to watch, all be it a bit confused as to the time lines, this was set 10 years before Kirk and how ever many years before Star Trek Voyager etc and yet the technology seems more modern that it did in other shows.

The show is kind of politically correct which is always a bad thing, as it is brain washing people into thinking that what they are allowing now such as gay characters etc is normal. After 50 odd years to suddenly bring same gender relationships in my eyes is wrong, especially when Children may watch this.

Glad to see Star Trek back anyway on our screens, already picked up for season 03 so hopefully we might have a long run with this show.

The Orville for me, just does not cut it, and sadly no other TV shows on that comes into the Sci Fi genre.

Hopefully one day, they might bring Stargate back.",28 February 2019
"Better than season one,i dont get this people who said is not a star trek. Stop being stupid and enjoy the show,we will see where will it get us. We now have Pike and Spock before he met Kirk.",4 March 2019
"I've been a Trekkie for a while. This review is written with other Sci Fi in mind as well, which is why I give it an average grade. That said, I've seen every episode of every Trek series at least twice, so it is hard not to judge against earlier content.

First the good: The show continues to be visually stunning. As a Trek fan, there are times, even in season 3, where episodes from past shows are referenced and characters or objects are reconstituted in some amazing ways that feel are authentic to the original intent of the character or franchise more broadly. Despite the serialized format of the show, there are a few times where you could look at two episodes or three almost as small movies in themselves. At these times, the show becomes as great as any trek before it. This show thrives when it includes two part or a trilogies of episodes. The writing in these shows is much tighter, and they feel more Trek like.

The show is visually stunning which is great for new audiences.

The character played by Michelle Yeoh is also well written, and Yeoh delivers her fabulously. The acting is very strong all around, as is the directing. Jonathan Frakes does a particularly good job among the directors.

The not so good...

Across all seasons, the writing contains plot holes and character development that makes little sense. In the first two seasons the main character suffers from this. In season three, she is consistent with the character we have seen from the middle of season one on, but still makes no sense with her backstory. The actress is talented though and really shines in season three particularly in season three episodes 9 and 10. I just wish the writers would make her grow more. The way the crew reacts to her also makes little sense.

In general, the writing in season one is better than in season two, and three is the best to date.

The show is largely missing the political commentary and hopeful feeling that the franchise usually includes. There are obvious attempts to capture this feeling and political commentary, but inconsistent writing and static characters get in the way.

Bottom line: If I watch the show to be distracted from the world around me. If I think of it as an adventure show set in the future, it is okay. If I want to leave with a hopeful feeling and light intellectual stimulation that Trek usually supplies, the show largely falls flat despite a few high points.",16 May 2019
"After having tried and tried again liking this iteration of Star Trek I have finally had to conclude that it quite simple doesn't deserve to be called Star Trek. This show is just such an exhausting collection of uninteristing, unsympathetic and unrelatable characters, immature writing, childish hand-to-hand combat, clumsy effect work, insanely and inappropiately stressful cinematography and just no respect whatsoever concerning what came before that I perceive watching the show frankly as a punishment. I am also currently re-watching ST-TNG and the worst episode of that show practically towers above the best episode of ST-Discovery. TNG had plausibility, a message, proper writing and acting and a fitting soundtrack none of which is present in Discovery I am afraid. I have tried and tried again to find the fault for this perception within myself but the rewatching of TNG as well as the classic TOS movies leaves me no choice but to conclude that this new version of Star Trek is aimed at another target audiende: people who need one-liners to overcome otherwise meaningful dialogues, repetitive physical action instead of complex dilemmas and a cast of characters so insanely diverse and politically correctly chosen that an average viewer might feel like the minority now. Discovery seems hellbent to become another vehicle of the woke movement and this suggests to me that Star Trek needed that in the first place which it didn't. Star Trek has always been the spearhead of television diversity but there is a point where it's not plausible anymore and Discovery is way beyond that point. Everything feels artificial and forced in that show. In summary, this feels nothing like the Star Trek I love and grew up with and I refuse to be told that all these changes had to be made to the brand because there was something wrong with it. Just look at The Orville which proves that a classic Star Trek - style storytelling and production approach is still in demand. Concluding by the failure of Star Trek - Enterprise nearly two decades ago that the brand needs massive change neglects that Enterprise failed more because of a franchise oversaturation/fatigue effect then because of it's improper and outdated concept. I would gladly take almost any ST-ENT episode over the apoplectically inert ST-discovery any day of the week!

I am not at all against evolution of the Star Trek brand but what Discovery does is not Star Trek, it is a completely forgettable fantasy-comedy with the name Star Trek put on of it. While it's successor show Star Trek - Picard might not be quite perfect as well the writers on that show at least tried and partially succeded in delivering a meaningful and coherent plot with proper acting and a feeling grounded in the canon of the previous shows and I can only hope that the upcoming ST-Strange New Worlds will also be a more classical approach to the topic of Star Trek. ST-Discovery honestly is a disgrace for the brand and should, and I'm sorry to say this, never have been conceived. After over 30 years of being a ST fan I am saddened at how dumbed down the franchise has become at least in this iteration and it infuriates me that it keeps continuing. I feel embarassed that this Sci-Fi misfire currently carries the torch for the best TV franchise ever conceived!",5 December 2021
"It is an excellent show with great potential, first officer Michael burnham played by Sonequa Martin-Green is great sets a great tone for this new star trek franchise. I have watched all star trek series' and this one is different and I think it is a fresh look at classic franchise.",25 September 2017
"Giving some good general impressions here. I've been a Star Trek fan for about ten years now. I love Sci-Fi. I have watched all of them starting with Next Generations. The best Star Trek films have a unified style. Star Trek Discovery just meanders all over the place.

Every episode plays out like a self contained little story that goes in some places it looks like they are taking the series some other direction. Not like a plot twist, but like the show runner keeps changing.

The characters in this one do not behave like usual Star Trek characters. They waver between to angry to stupid. They have no depth or sides to their two dimensional personalities.",20 April 2018
"Discovery has the most consistently bad episodes week after week. I don't know why this wasn't cancelled after season 3. Other Star Trek shows, Enterprise and TOS, were cancelled while still making quality content. Discovery never really had quality Star Trek content outside of some of season 2. It has been an insult to Star Trek and the episode's rating shows how the fans really think of STD.",10 March 2022
"I am a huge Star Trek-Fan and with me all started with the Original Series (TOS). The Next Generation was great and I even liked Voyager. I just didn't like Enterprise at first, as many did, cause it didn't look like a Star Trek Series. Later i decided to watch it and i had to admit, i was wrong! Enterprise was a great series and it had some of the best Trek-episodes of all time. Now I know I will not do the same with this series and ignore it, just because it looks different. yes, it looks better then the TOS-Series from the sixties, even though it plays before that time, but come on... nobody wanted it that old school trashy. it is a very well done update and it looks just fantastic! and the first time it seems that Star Trek has a big budget. a dream comes true! The CGI is amazing, Klingons got their own world and well done architecture, though it looks to much like Gothic on earth and they look a little bit more than vampires, but, why not? I am quite sure they will have an explanation why they look different (i heard something about genetic experiences). they look mysterious and dangerous and just because we have seen just a group of Klingons, that doesn't mean that all of them are evil. Klingons and the federation were gone through evolutions, why don't show that? Maybe both have changed a lot after this or during this series. the 2 main actresses will be great in the future, though Michelle Yeoh hasn't found her own interpretation yet and had some smaller problems. The hologram was really not necessary, the critics are right with that, but i can live with it. Would have been better to communicate oldschool, but that doesn't ruin the whole show, though it really reminds of Star Wars. the other Star Wars hint was quite funny. To start the show in the desert, with humans in hoodies and then showing the Star Trek symbol has amused me. Settings are great and so on... so whats the problem right now? the plot! it started very slow and the cliffhanger could have been much better, especially when the series is going to Netflix and CBS-All Access. I am not that much interested to buy it, right now, but i am also not declining the series. it will be a big budget (yay!) Trek-series and i will watch it, for sure! but maybe just when its on free TV or on Netflix at a friend; and calm down haters, you will be able to see it. it just takes time. and Yes, its darker than the optimistic old series, but doesn't it fit into our time this way?! Star Trek has always been a mirror of the time it was made and that was always one of the reasons why it was interesting. We live in a dark and pessimistic world right now, so Star Trek has to show that. And it would be a surprise if the federation and the galaxy has always been in peace and just diplomatic. i like this decision, though it isn't said that it will stay that dark. that was just the pilot! i would have preferred a series in the timeline after TNG/DS9 and Voyager. but its okay for me. the only bad decision was that they show just 1 episode on free TV. They should have shown 2 or 3 episodes, so we would be more interested whats coming. 45mins were quite short and they haven't told that much in that time. I am happy that Star Trek is back, even though its darker now. Budget and quality is there. I hope it has a good story. the pilot wasn't able to answer that question. Don't rate a book by its cover! A pilot cannot give all the explanations some of you want and you cannot love every character from the beginning. Every show needs its time, Star Trek is no exception. so-called fans: don't kill it before it even started. give it a chance (a real one!)",26 September 2017
"It's not what I expected. If you're here looking for the TOS or TNG experience, you're going to be disappointed. Instead look at this as a standalone.

The Star Wars with Star Trek universe is a bad analogy. This is without a doubt Star Trek. However it plays outside the boundaries of the Star Trek we are used to. It will be flashy, it will look awe-inspiring. The acting ALL AROUND is pretty good. Do I like the characters? I certainly liked the Captain for one. I'm not sure how I feel about Michael. She definitely reminds me of a mix between Ryker and Nerys; she's overconfident and is jumping at the chance to prove herself while at the same time may resort to extreme measures to protect people she cares about.

Unlike the exploration or the enforcement of morals, here we see a rather trigger-happy reaction. It's to be expected. It's how the Vulcan's dealt with them. The whole point here is that you act accordingly to the culture you are making contact with. If you offend their culture, they might very well resort to war. To the Klingons of this title, the statement ""We come in peace"" is just poison. Like witches word. This sentiment is reflected in MANY interpretations of Star Trek, both canon and fanfic. Even Axanar took that approach and that was a fan project/side scam.

The fact stands if you want what old school Star Trek has to offer, you should watch Orville. Orville is the perfect embodiment in spirit of old Star Trek. But this new Star Trek IS amazing and good.

You have to review the title from an objective standpoint where NEWVIEWERS completely new to Star Trek can watch and enjoy as well. I see a lot of people writing reviews because it didn't live up to what they had anticipated or was different from what they had expected which is pretty biased/lame/childish. The first two episodes were good enough to be movies and were way better than JJ Trek. You might identify this more with JJ Trek because of how the graphics look but make no mistake this isn't some just mindless flash and action. There's some serious dialogue in the script that makes this all too familiar with Star Trek's stance on approaching social issues. Also there aren't that many GOOD sci-fi's out. This definitely will be among the better ones airing currently. I might like Orville better but I will still watch this to get my Star Trek/sci fi fix. It's either that and Dark Matter and I love Dark Matter but there's too much ridiculousness there.",28 September 2017
"It started out a little slow the first few episodes, but I'm rapidly growing very fond of every aspect of this show. Good characters, good production.

Nothing is what it used to be. Nothing is what it seems, the captain doesn't seem very dependable and ultimately nobody is safe. In that aspect this show is very fresh and not as politically correct as the old star trek series we used to have.

My only problem so far is that Michael is rising through the ranks a little too fast for my tastes. But hopefully we'll see more of the dark and gritty side of life on a Fededation vessel.

So far so good.",1 November 2017
Nice twists in story. The next best series after enterprise according to me. Good actors. Absolutely worth seeing and incredibly nice technique on the effects.,3 October 2019
"I have always been a big fan and I have to admit that I feared the worst after watching the first episode. The acting looked stiff and not very natural. I liked the look of the new set though, and I was happy to see that the new production crew had made an effort to modernize the concept. I liked the visual aspect a lot.

So.. the first episode was bad but.. the second episode was much much better. I think the new crew was just a bit nervous and I think the series will only get better as the story will unfold. The end of the second episode was quite interesting and I think that three months from now people will just love this new approach.

Please try to keep an open mind and try to understand that it is half a century ago that Star Trek was created. You can't expect younger generations to approach Star Trek the same as Trekkies that have been a fan from the start once did.It is time to move baldy forward into the unknown and leave the old Star Trek behind.

I think it will be great. Give it time and it will grow and flourish !",27 September 2017
"Michael Burnam - WHY she always, i mean ALWAYS, in every episode !!!, CRIES ??!!?? In 2 season almost EVERY scene with her was so ""dramatic"" and she always cries, so after couple of episodes you have really enough of her !! Hope she won't come back in next seasons !!!",30 April 2019
"This is a very good version of Trek. Ignore the haters. Special effects are great story is good by in large better the Trek OG stories Yes the Klingons due look horrible but that aside it's very good. Pike is a awesome captain give him his due. Apparently most need to rewatch Trek OG. Yes it was a amazing show for it's time, that being said it does not age well and Shatner is my favorite captain.",11 January 2020
"Here's one of my biggest gripes about Discovery. Remember back at the beginning of the series, they promised us this was going to be the show that bridges between the series Enterprise right up to the original Star Trek. They were going to fill in the gaps, especially about the Federation/Klingon war. That was a very ambitious project, and one I was looking forward to watching. But the Klingon war was handled horribly. They changed the Klingons into this ridiculous group of religious zealots who dressed like dauphins from the 13th century. And then, halfway through the season, they jettisoned this larger arc to instead focus on the Mirror universe. Fine, I love the Mirror universe when it's done well, and this might have made a good arc for the second or third season. They should have just continued with the Klingon war, and gotten into it in depth. But they chose to push it aside and make it peripheral, even forgotten, until the end of the season when they tacked it onto the end of the Mirror universe story and conveniently ended the war. Plot was tossed aside. Timeline history in the Star Trek universe was treated as inconsequential. They could have made the Klingon war the key focus for the entire series, and it could have been really cool. Remember that the Dominion war in Deep Space Nine lasted at least four seasons. ST:D has no ambition to carve itself out as part of Star Trek canon. It just treats historical events within the Star Trek timeline as backdrop for these mediocre characters to constantly show their feelings. And this was proven when they were so cavalier as to time jump the ship and its characters into the far future when it became more convenient to do this, rather than hold the show to canon. This show does not care about the Star Trek universe or timeline, it only cares about the gender politics. When the show is over and done with, there will be even greater backlash, to the point where we will see fan generated stories, or possibly even official Star Trek movies or series, whose point will be to correct the problems that this series has created. You think the Wesley Crusher backlash was bad? Wait till you see the Gray Tal backlash. (or ""Grate All"" as many will call the character)",29 January 2022
"It started with a determination to be more like the world as a whole, not White America with a few extras in lesser roles.

It admirably keeps up the process.

Is realistic about how hard it would be to unify Vulcans and Romulans.

And I am amused rather than angered by all the character who apparently watch it each weak just to say how little they like it.

Gratifying they seem to have nothing better to do

Sad they are unable to move on from outdated prejudices.",28 November 2020
"Beautiful production, with loving details from Star Trek history.

Unfortunately, the show effectively has a single protagonist and Star Trek has always been about the crew and how they come together. Far, far, too much time is spent on how the characters are feeling, vs actually doing. And finally, the music and the drama try to persuade you that these are highly intelligent people that are dealing with incredibly difficult problems, but this is simply not born out by narratives themselves.

I don't know if this show can be saved, and that's a tradgedy goven the beautiful work of the artists who have constructed this world. Perhaps if they killed off Burnham, and then didn't have time to feel that bad about it, but I don't see that happening.

I really think they're doing their best here, and some of the work is truly wonderful, but without better writing they're dead in the water.",15 April 2019
Everyone including the computer is going through personal angst. Gender fluidity abounds and storyline (when not about personal history) are a mish mash of predictable and rejigged older Star Trek episodes. Season 4 ep 6 is particularly vomit inducing.,24 December 2021
What happened here. This is a kind of romantic SyFy. Please save Star Trek. Totally wasted of time.,17 February 2019
"I don't get all the very negative reviews. This is TV folks. It's just an hour of what sometimes is entertainment based in sci-fi. It's not trying to be a remake of all the other Star Treks ever made. It's a new version, which does have flaws, just as all the other STs did.

Let''s not forget that the first viewers of Star Trek:TNG complained like crazy that it was a miserable show compared to original Star Trek, and they would prefer to just stay watching the old episodes of ST. Of course, ST:TNG turned pretty successful. I believe Discovery has enough going on to remain viable.

Some episodes play around with interesting concepts about time, space, new gadgets, etc. The acting overall probably isn't about to win any Emmy awards, but sometimes there are good bits by Michelle Yeoh and others, which I find very entertaining. I'm perfectly happy to watch what happens next, and hope this show isn't prematurely cancelled, as the network did with the original ST.",18 December 2020
"It is worth noting that the criticisms of the plots and scripting are mostly those with poor spelling and punctuation, possibly geek fans who want to sound like serious, mature critics by not automatically fawning over it just because it's Star Trek. This drama is hard-going, a bit too unremitting at times, with few of the lighter moments of the original series. (Admittedly, that got a bit farcical, even cringeworthy at times.) The production values and special effects are impressive (notwithstanding the amateur critics who somehow thought them mediocre). The acting is generally very good and believable. The plot lines and dialogue are worthy of what Roddenberry would have liked to do in the early days. Possibly the silliest thing about it all is the mycelial drive. Warp drive is currently a fantasy but at least seems credible. The mycelial drive isn't. The choice of end theme for the last episode of season 1 was a nice touch.",20 December 2018
"To be honest I never was a super huge Star Trek fan, my journey with space TV shows started with Babylon 5 which in my opinion is way above and beyond of most Star Trek Shows, maybe except DS9 which is a clone of Babylon5 and yet I have seen all of the Star Trek films, Next Generation, Voyager, DS9 and Enterprise... I really wonder what happened to the screenwriters of Star treks from 80s- 00's , seems like all of that creativity and talent has disappeared with them and the only thing that is left is some art of John Eaves... So where does Discovery stand in this? The problem is it is not about Discovery, it's an action show with weak but long story arcs unlike Orville where they follow the old Trek pathways ... For me the Discovery stands somewhere in that spot where Voyager would have 2 episode arcs with action and boosted budget, imagine a trek show built only out of those, this is what Discovery is, except it has 2 story arcs for two seasons... In the end it's worth mentioning that both shows have plenty of gay characters... What 21st century needs is for Russians to make their own version of Star Trek and Battlestar with a ton of hot chicks and proper CGI, to remind USA what it lost by gaining liberal values...",15 February 2019
"If you enjoy character shells crying and talking about their feelings nonstop while a diverse female Captain Space Jesus without flaws or character saves the Universe and destroys every timeline of Star Trek - go ahead.

You can also tell which ratings on IMBD were written by Shills or production crew members and friends. They are either not real fans of Star Trek or just got asked or paid to push the score.",5 December 2021
After seeing only two episodes I must say that the new Star Trek TV show looks promising. It's much darker then the old shows and the special effect are amazing. I bet they put a lot of money in it. Maybe the acting is a little bit wooden or crappy but can you remember the first season of Star Trek TNG? That was terrible and the first episode was a big mess. It's also a relief to see the klingons speak in their own language instead of using some klingon words and falling back into English like in the old shows. Now after two episodes we have a big cliffhanger and I have no doubt that it can compete with the old ones.,28 September 2017
"Star Trek fan and viewer since the beginning. This is the worst. The universe needs saving, the ship is about to go down and hundreds lost, lives are at stake and only moments remain until disaster. But nothing can be decided and little can be done until the handful of primary characters have examined all the emotional baggage they carry around. Not one episode but every episode.

You could rationalize and imagine making the -far stretch- ideas in previous ST as ""yeah, that might be possible"". Not in Discovery. Some themes are so detached that you really wonder if the writers are actually high.

Wife and I are near the end of season 2. I doubt we will finish it.",26 January 2022
"This series is unremittingly dark, dismal, and humorless. The first several series were not always sophisticated, but they had engaging characters, humor and whimsey, occasionally very good drama, and were filled with basic decency. The last two series seemed to offer only angst-as-meaning, shoot-'em up action, and dim, grim, plots.",9 March 2021
The Star Trek has to be the best ever! It won't let you down you feel like your watching a well made trek movie that doesn't end! You must watch it!,12 March 2018
"The thing that is so fun about this and Picard is the special effects. We obviously have grown in our ability for video special effects, and both Discovery and Picard reflect that. There is a definite tie to Star Trek which is nice also. The music is good as is the cast. I'm enjoying this series.",3 April 2020
"I wanted to precede my initial review with this update, because I persisted with watching the series. And frankly, I am glad that I did because by episode 2 of series 2 it begins to gain the 'this is what Star Trek should be' theme! It took a significant character shift but they did it! Perhaps they listened to the critical reviews, I should check the credits to see if they fired the original writers, because by the end of episode 2 of series 2, I am now hooked! So my advice is simple: SKIP the entire tail end of series 1, it is just awful, jump from the middle of series 1 to the series 2 and you will not be disappointed.

Sorry. The acting is great, the characters are pretty good. But the story lines, well that is the problem, they are so complicated and the story line is so 'bloody' awful that what started of with great promise has gone so far down hill that I actually find myself wanting to do something else, rather than watch it.

Don't get me wrong, the special effects are amazing, the sets are convincing and the cinematography is second to none, but ALL of that is wasted when you have to tolerate a terrible and I mean terrible; twisting turning, going basically nowhere, storyline that makes you feel sick to the stomach.. What a waste.

Synopsis: The actors are pretty convincing and the special effects are amazing but it is a shame that they have to tarnish the Star Trek name with this. The story writers should be taken to a dark place somewhere in the middle of nowhere and left (given their inability to produce a coherent story, chances are they'll stay lost forever - hopefully).",27 March 2019
The negative reviews are from closed minded people that perhaps don't like change. That being said... the series goes places never thought of and has a lot more to offer a wider more inclusive audience. I'm a huge have of the Star Trek genre and Star Trek Discovery is by far the best... so far...,9 February 2018
"I agree with everything they say. I am devastated. Season 3 was slightly better than 1 & 2 possibly because the dreadful Michael character is toned down ever so slightly.

Maybe she listened to the salvageable Terran Georgiou character when she said: ""God Michael! Know when to shut the hell up!""

Terran Phillipa's quote on first meeting Book when he said she was not Detmer or Tilly also pleases me: ""I'd rather kill myself"".

The Christopher Pike spin off could be promising. Oh, and Admiral Cornwall was 'good Star Trek', but of course she got killed off, presumably because she wasn't crying, hugging and giving long soliloquies all the time.... Oh and appeared to be 'straight'.",21 January 2022
"If I only watched what got decent reviews on IMDB, I wouldn't watch anything. Ever. It's astonishing to read how the reviewers of Discovery try to pile the hate-on-hate to the point of making it a competition to see who can use the most words to say absolutely nothing.

The character Michael is the way she is because of her Vulcan upbringing - which, if you know anything about the series, is a pretty severe way of life. Traditionally any Vulcan character in the ST universe in solo mode is a know-it-all (who is usually right) with little to no tolerance of human emotion. Juxtapose that with a human brought up in that environment (with Sarek as a father, no less) and hence ypu have Michael. Being played perfectly by Sonequia Martin Green (from Walking Dead).

I'm only a few eps into season 1 -- and am utterly fascinated by how brutal and physically different the Klingons are. But nobody seems to be talking about that - just how BORED they are with it and what a disservice to the franchise ... Blah blah blah. I'm surprised nobody's complained about the amount of reading they have to do (Klingon translations)!

My point is this: watch it. Decide for yourself. Try to go into it with an open mind. It's entertainment. Let it entertain you.",17 April 2020
"Season 1 starts off fun, adventurous. But season 2 dwindles down into the Michael Burnham crying show as she has bad emotional dialogue with each of her three mothers constantly. It's painful, and it's really bad. I'll always treasure the good time I had in season 1, but after that, it's unbearable.",23 April 2020
"This season has a lot of filler dialogue to meet the 43 min minimum. I found that if you fast forward through all the unimportant conversations, there's actually a story there. Probably about 5 episodes worth of content.",18 March 2022
"I read these reviews with amusement, they were the same for Star Trek Enterprise at the time which was cancelled ditto Star Trek Voyager. Looking back folk are now bleating, ah what a shame, it was just coming into its own blah blah. Give it a time to bed in, stop comparing it to something that was produced decades ago. It is what it is.",23 October 2017
Well the 3rd season is slow indeed but I am still watching. Even if I care only for captain georgiou and micheal.,14 November 2020
"I love Star Trek so I couldn't wait to watch this series. After the first two episodes I couldn't help but ask what the hell was I watching? The storyline was barely advancing and the Klingons speak in actual Klingon which slows the episodes even further.

It's important to remember this series is taking place before the Kirk era. One thing I always resented from Star Trek is that they were living in this Utopia of human civilization: The Prime Directive, no salaries, no poverty, everyone having the opportunity to work in their ""ideal"" job... humans were always so ""righteous"" whereas every other civilization or race encountered had all the problems. This series is NOT this utopia. And it's nice to see that struggle as the characters and the Federation evolves.

Yes, slow to start and brutal are the contrasts to other Star Trek series. But after episode 4, I was totally hooked. The depth of the characters, the politics, the amazing special effects and I even began to appreciate the Klingons. Do not expect the super friendly Picard or the Kumbaya singing amongst the crew.

This show is an excellent Sci-fi series using the Star Trek franchise and the story line is solid. Even if you're not a Star Trek fan you might greatly enjoy this production for its sci-fi value.",10 July 2018
"So this is pretty good scifi, but so many other agendas. They 20% of the show for promoting African Americans. They take at least 30% of the show in season 3 for trans gen promotion. Seriously, star trek has been about sci Fi not thes alternate agendas. While not offensive, I don't have a problem philosophically, it's just too much and I've been tempted meany times it just turn it off. You don't need to force feed me trans equilization agenda nor a race equalization agenda which are flagrant here. Just make it about the sci Fi themes please. The medical staff gay issue promotion are there too, but really not the dominant theme at this point. They're not making it las this season with this offshoot agenda(s).",8 July 2022
"I have watched 3 seasons of this show hoping it would grow into something good, but it has not. It is a political expression of everything wrong with the world today.

"It is a very short review since I don't have much time and don't want to explain the details of the serie. I talk mainly about the second saison the first was not that bad and focused more on short drama scene and action. The main problem with this serie is most of the scenes are ridiculous at a point you can just laught or find it totally absurd. Well ok you can deal with it and say to yourself: ""well... ok it is an absurd comedy!"" but 2 minutes later and your comedy is transformed to a boring drama., Long drama scene they stretch at a point you clearly understand you are not watching a comedy but a poorly made SF drama or worste.. a poorly made SF comedy!!! They need to focus on one or the other because that is really anoying at a point you just want to do something else then watching that.

Acting is great but long useless drama scene don't give any chance for people to appreciate the final result. :D",22 April 2019
"Season 1-2 was pretty good and I enjoyed the show, now season 3 and 4 I'm lost.

Why get so politically correct? Season 4 it's like watching HR give a seminar on all parties must agree and check peoples feelings.....fyi, I have my doubts running a galaxy would work that way so playing the political correct cards is just trash tv.

Painful to watch, the constant check on feelings stuff is sad and sickening. Pausing a battle to check each other's feelings?

Anyways, totally foolish now.",6 December 2021
"Seriously.get.a.grip The world has turned into a cover version. It is one big tribute festival.

This is killing creativity, barring new minds and ideas and of course training a generation of writers and directors to only be studio hacks as opposed to creative mind.

Every film is a sequel or spin off. Every film will come with prequels and its own reboot. Everything must be spun off for TV and ... oh.. what am I saying... who cares? Let the film studios choke on their regularly scheduled Marvel releases. JJ Abrams is laughing at the sucker.

As for Star Trek Discovery: good luck monetizing the Chinese market. it is boring and bland and needs to make the rebel Klingons so outlandishly non-cannon because nothing else is left to say. It has all been done before. Good luck guys with the Star Trek TV reboot of 2024 and the next six Abrams directed/produced stories. Off to not go see Star Wars 8...",10 October 2017
I am loving this reboot of the series. Great storyline which is dark and absorbing. Twists and turns that I didn't see coming and I usually work out storylines way too quickly! Glad to see a second series is planned. As it doesn't feature the Enterprise its good to see that they are free to take the stories wherever they want to without it impacting the old or new timelines for the Enterprise. Great show!!,6 February 2018
"I cannot understand why people are giving it bad reviews are they idiots who just want to leave bad reviews? I like many others accepted the new startreks new Klingon's look, and to be fair they have actually changed a lot throughout startrek. The original Trekkie's will remember the Klingon's saying and their actions such as the screaming on the warriors deaths, that happens in this series. The story is fantastic, fits in well in the startrek universe. Set 10 years before the enterprise based on a science vessel, the story can be dark but exciting. It's got fantastic characters,people moan about the lighting...turn the contrast up on your TV... Idiots. The effects are very good. It's a very good series so far, don't be fooled by all the stupid pointless reviews. If you actually watch it you will realise it's very good and I hope it gets made in to a long series. It has a lot of potential.",4 October 2017
"Great intriguing series that really builds on the Star Trek story. The only thing is, does there really have to be so much crying or nearly crying, it occurs in every episode! It's hard to believe that a starship could operate with so many sentimental, fragile officers that need to have a cry. Oh well, still a good series to watch though.",26 November 2020
"After sifting through a big pile of negative reviews, it was time to find out firsthand what ST Discovery is all about. A good place to start is Season 1 Episode 1...

Though it's not TOS, TNG or VOY, I found each episode sufficiently interesting to keep me curious about what transpires in the successive episode. Personally, I can't say as much about DS9 or ST Enterprise.

Yes, it's definitely NOT what Trekkies like about Roddenberry's ST universe. The Klingons resemble reptiles more than humans and do appear weird to a genuine Trekkie. Why the creators of STD decided to make these ""phony"" looking Klingons speak in ""Klingon"" is beyond me!! I heard more ""Klingonese"" phrases in just the pilot episode than in the entire seven seasons of TNG.....

Nevertheless, I found myself following closely the actions of the main characters. The Chinese female captain (played by Michelle Yeoh) was particularly warm and friendly, especially with her first officer Michael Burnham. A female officer with a male name is most unusual. If nothing else, it DOES make her stand out from the rest....and maybe that's why she picked this name, who knows?

Yes, most reviewers have harshly judged the character of Michael Burnham, as being too cold etc. Yet in view of her upbringing, it's understandable. Just watch a handful of episodes to comprehend her more deeply, prior to passing judgment. It's all too easy to criticize Michael Burnham, if you don't understand her background...

IF you strive to watch ST Discovery with an open mind, you might discover that it IS worth watching....even though it's NOT of the same caliber as TOS or TNG or VOY. Ultimately, as the old adage goes: ""Beauty is in the Eyes of the Beholder"". If I could watch ST Discovery episodes and find them enjoyable, maybe you might also....",31 January 2019
"Well I read a lot of the reviews here before I watched and as so many are negative they almost put me off watching at all but my son urged me to watch it and make my own judgement I am very glad I did. I have been a Trekkie since the late 60s and I have enjoyed every incarnation of the franchise, this one being no exception. I have now watched 4 episodes and I love it as much as any other Trek, people hated Enterprise but I loved that too and was saddened by its early termination. Yep the Klingons are different, but remember the original series Klingons, so what, great I love them, I have always loved Klingons , so much so that the band I play and sing in occasionally appear in full Klingon costume, and I found the new look very interesting and an enhancement of the Klingon culture. The story line is captivating and the main protagonist Michael Burnham is very watchable. and I can see other characters like Sylvia Tilly, Saru and Paul Stamets becoming loved members of yet another Trek family as in all past shows. Like my son (who was brought up on Trek) I urge you to watch this and let it in to the wonderful and diverse world that is Star Trek.",11 October 2017
"An interesting take in the Star Trek universe. I'd say season 1 was a 6/7 for me and season 2 a solid 8. My favourite characters are Saru and Pike but I'm loving this version of Spock as well. Michael gets a lot of hate, if you don't like the character, actress or plot then do your mental health a favour, stop watching and forget about it. No show is perfect and yes sometimes things don't make sense, people act really really stupid but just switch off and enjoy the ride as the Universe is under no obligation to make sense to you....",6 October 2020
Somehow this turned into a giant pile of.. soap opera for teenagers BS (if this even exists). Soo much drama and unnecessary smiles and pleasantries and very little and very rushed action scenes. I started skipping scenes and after a while I just stopped watching after 3 or 4 episodes. I could not handle it anymore. Total disaster!,24 March 2022
During the first season I was like: WHAT is going on. The second season got me hooked right away and totally loving the characters and everything,19 April 2019
"I am not a hardcore ST fan, but I have seen all the series and the movies. Good entertainment, Discovery is quite interesting, as it explores the era before Kirk. Special effects are good, but not outstanding. The story is good but not very engaging. The acting is great, apart from the main character. Too much emotion for a battle-hardened Star Fleet commander who was raised by Vulcans, even for a human, plus she can't even express her character's emotions in a persuasive manner. Political correctness is somewhat forced upon the viewer, making the series seem more like propaganda sometimes. The Klingon make up is simply hilarious, the actors can even open their mouth in a natural way. If you are a hard core ST fan you will be disappointed. If you just like sci-fi then you will get some enjoyment out of it, but dont expect to be mind blown.",11 July 2019
"Thoughtful, intelligent, pragmatic; is how you would describe nearly every federation officer in the 1990s shows. However, not a single character in Discovery could be described as such. Not a single character in Discovery is likeable or relatable.

1990s Star Trek was a show about hope. Hope in that the human race would come together, solve war, poverty and ignorance through education and science and then make it humanity's sole mission to better one's self (which in turn betters humanity). Star Trek would take an idea, present it from multiple points of view, let the viewer make up their own mind about it and then the show would end and they'd be on to the next thing, possibly revisiting an old issue from a different angle at a later date.

Discovery is anti-trek. It's actually somehow incredibly narcissistic and doesn't lend itself well to the streaming format. They take a topic, beat you over the head with it for a whole season (or more) and then you realize that you just watched a dozen episodes and absolutely nothing happens. You conclude that had you watched the first and last episode of the season, you'd have missed nothing important.

If you don't somehow feel like you've been taken hostage after watching a few episodes, maybe you'll enjoy it?

3/10 because the special effects and some of the music are very good.",25 January 2023
"Review of seasons 1-4

Discovery can be hit and miss. Season 2 was the best so far. Loved the addition of Pike and Spock to the show. I can definitely see why they got their own.

While the season arcs can be a bit irritating sometimes, in my opinion Discovery is much better than Picard. It definitely isn't a 2-3 star show. I agree that Michael can be trying as a character, but there are lots of others to balance her out, and she has gotten better over time. Saru in particular is a great contrast.

I appreciate that the show has gotten back to the exploration themes toward the end of season four. That's what has always made Star Trek for me. Looking forward to season 5 and seeing where Starfleet ventures next!",28 December 2022
"I live Startrek I have noticed 7 episodes in that sexuality as now been added. One of the leading characters a woman is called ""Michael"" And I have just found out that the Clinton's are based on anti Trump sentiment. And yes the producers have stated that fact.

It use to be entertaining not the propaganda tool of the left or should I say far left.

Hollywood stop virtue signalling and clear your own deprived house get that in order before you start ruining a great franchise.

Otherwise the actors are great good performances and great all round visuals",7 November 2017
"Season 2 started slow but is ending with a bang. This is not like Star Trek use to be but I am enjoying this show. All those complaining about the end of Star Trek obviously have little faith in the enduring legacy of Star Trek. I watch this and guess what , I still watch all of the other series and still enjoy them as I have when I first saw the show in 1966. Apparently reviews are now a platform for haters to bombard us with their views that are not based on anything about the actual show. U Tube is full of these people and their followers . An example is a review damning the new Picard series , a show still in development and yet is already criticised by these people! Captain Marvel has received the same treatment and because it's making a lot of money they blame the going public as blind followers who don't know crap! I've been a comic book fan and sci fi fan most of my 56 years and I for one am sick of being told I am not a true fan if I don't follow their ideals! If you are some one who takes any review on blind faith you are not being true to yourself ! How about make your own judgement instead of just blindly following what you see as popular opinion, don't be afraid to go against it!",7 April 2019
Season 1 is good. Sharp decline in season 2. And 3 .... well...barely watchable and only in small portions can it be digested. Every 5 minutes there is an emo-moment with the violins in full swing.

"I'm a life long trekkie and I love this new series. Star Trek TNG came out 30 years ago, it's time for a fresh new interpretation of the franchise and this is it. They have not strayed from the history and lore of the Trek universe, which I appreciate. Also, there have been some scenes that included a bit of science and logic jargon that we all love from some of the previous series.",26 September 2017
"First, for you that still are mad over that this show moved from Netflix to Paramount+ don't worry and be happy. You probably don't want to see it anymore because season 4 is really bad. Netflix made Star Trek fans a favour to drop it.

I'm a big Sci-Fi fan and tries to see everything with a space ship in it so offcourse I've seen everything called Star Trek.

Now when I seen the first seven episodes of season 4 I have a question to the writers and directors. - why did you do this to us, do you hate the fans?

I don't know how to explain this season but it's some kind of hbtq educational show trying to learn us about tolerance aimed at teens under 13. The thing is that it is so slow and boring so target audiens wont see it anyway.

I can just warn you. If you don't like it from the beginning don't bother - it's getting worse. If you somehow like it (you must be a fan of Grey and Adira), well go on.

I'm rating it as high as 4 because the first seasons at Netflix was better.

Sad to say it, but it's time to cancel Star Trek Discovery.",20 January 2022
"...i realy enjoyed. And yes it is Star Trek, it is Star Trek Discovery and not Enterprise, First Generation or Voyager.",10 June 2019
Awesome. It's a new level. I love the new characters,10 February 2019
"I started watching Star Trek shows when I was 18 in 1966. I have watched every episode of every Trek production. This one is beyond measure my favorite. I cannot pick a favorite character in this show because they all are. I am invested in and attached to every single one, even the baddies if you can call them that.

I read some of the low rated reviews and seem to find that if you liked immature and macho male leads as the Captain then this show was not for you. If you liked superficial, video game type action then this show was not for you. If you resented actors who did not fit into the Barbie and Ken mold or were not strictly in the beautiful heterosexual mold then this show was not for you.

I can tell you that my least favorite, almost hated Star Trek Series was ""Enterprise"" If you loved that series then you might not care for this one. They are possibly exact opposites. I am re-watching that series now hoping to be kinder to it. While I am not as passionately against it as I was and am now able to appreciate some of the story lines I spend way too much of the show saying ""JHC I can deliver a line better than that!"" The timing of delivery on that show is horrific with NO comic relief. With Enterprise I feel no attachment to a single character except for the doctor. There is absolutely no tension or suspense. I can watch it while playing solitaire or a crossword puzzle and not miss a single thing. With Discovery I am on the edge of my seat and some times must get up and walk around because the suspense is just too much. With Discovery I love the writing, the wit, the delivery, the visuals - everything about it. I never get tired of the opening. The show is simply beautiful, smart and well delivered.

The only complaint I can find to offer about the show is that in a couple of places I found myself saying, ""My god man! Hurry up!!! You don't have time to be talking!"" Of course you only say such things out loud or to yourself when you are totally pulled into the show. I guess then that isn't really a complaint. I wholeheartedly love this show.",11 August 2019
"I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews. I found the original Star Trek to be hokey and derivative. This is much, much better.",8 October 2020
"Special effects are a 10. The sets are amazing and describe in depth a new future for Star Trek. The storyline breathes new life in a tired genre. Actors are believable and add validation to the story. Unfortunately, the Starship Discovery is full of constant self centered emotional outbursts and an unrelenting need to validate its own existence. The crew is whiny and week and only happy when celebrating each other in goofy ways. Reminds me of Camelot. A silly place.",31 December 2021
Cant believe how terrible it is.over confusing to emotional way to much going on.don't care how old captain Kirk is please bring him back...vimmer frame too!!,18 January 2021
"It's fun to watch, though traditional trekkies will definitely hate it.

I did not understand why exactly they put it before the events of the original series, as it seemed like there was no advantage in doing so and the ship is vastly more advanced than the Enterprise of the original series. It becomes apparent in season 2, almost like they put it in that time frame for Season 2. Seems less Star Trek like and more just Sci-Fi with some Start Trek characters.

The big issue with putting it in the time frame they did is that it puts it in danger of messing with already long-established characters. And by the way, who has been doing the make up? Seems like every Vulcan and Romulan in this show and Picard have crooked eyebrows. Their right one is always raised.",8 April 2020
"I enjoyed ST Discovery at FIRST. Then I got sucked into The Walking Dead and other shows and never went back. I'm here, writing my this, because of all The Super Bowl ads. Here it goes;

1. Well first off I wasn't completely sold on the lead actor. She is convincing but sometimes wayyyy too over the top and I mean come on...this is Star Trek. It's not a space drama. There isn't a lot of super emotional acting. I always noticed this about Star Trek. It's why people like it. I wasn't blown away by Jean Luc either but he also didn't annoy me. He did his job and was able to propel the storyline with some toughness. Star Trek always had a lighter side, in a way, it was easy to watch like a comedy. Her acting her is just too much. It's above average but it's not Star Trek acting.

2. The storyline was solid at first but I started to get lost as the show went on. Rewinding constantly annoyed me and if I'm correct, there were very few recaps at the beginning of each episode. This could just be a symptom ofy losing interest but I tried extra hard to follow the story than just gave up and tried to push through even though I was lost because it was too much work to go back. This lead to my loss of interest.

3. It's really a 7.5 that's really what this show feels like. It's on par with the Dr. Who w Matt Smith which is awesome but so confusing sometimes I can't give it any higher of a rating. So STD is solid but there has to be some adjustments. Why? This is Star Trek that's why. One of the best sci-fi shows of all time and the creators first job is to respect that. The bar is higher now than in the past. The Mandalorian proved that it's possible to keep the bar high even though times are changing and that there are no modern excuses.

That being said I have a bad taste in my mouth when I watch ST Discovery. Many of my friends and family hate it and I can easily see why...this really isn't a Star Trek show. There is too much drama and the writing is always about an evil villain. People loved TNG because it was about a TEAM WORKING TOGETHER. That can't be emphasized enough. The enemy was rarely a supervillain and the plot had a sense of a slow indie movie more than that of a Marvel Comics movie!! Get it!! Not everything should be like the annoying MCU!! God help us!!! Star Strek and Star Wars are NOT MARVEL!! Anyway, my antidote is as follows. All that producers of Star Trek need to do is make Star Trek DARKER. That's it. They always make it kinda too happy and make the new characters too nice. When I mean DARKER, I mean more suspenseful a la Hitchcock. Seriously. All the great Star Treks had a Hitchockian edge. The originals came out closer to that era after all! To support my point I must say I noticed ally Star Trek loving friends that can't stand Discovery also seem to love Breaking Bad for example. Breaking Bad is not a Marvel movie. Get it? The great Treks are more like Breaking Bad or a Hitchcock movie than they are ike Marvel. Hitchcock with aliens on a spaceship. That's the solution.",8 February 2021
"Quick, the tension is mounting and... stop to have a conversation about friendship or bottled water. It gets annoying. Where's the urgency? Heck, most of the crew would try to wave down a borg drone to try and 'emo' angst the darn thing into being peaceful and caring.

Ugghh. It's what we have so we continue watching.",21 March 2022
"Seriously? Naysayers who don't see that this is ""Star Trek"" brought up to speed for modern audiences. All of the classical elements are on full display here. I am excited for how this series will grow and unfold with insights & explorations of our future possibilities! The airwaves/ inspiration pipeline have been vacant for too long! If you love ""Trek"", watch it, reality will follow!",25 September 2017
"Season 1 is quite good. S2 ok. S3 goes downhill quickly and is basically terrible. S1 is quite complex, and the pot is intriguing. Very entertaining. S2 continues well enough, and becomes even more complex. Really interesting for the first half, it suffers from its own complexity. S3 is amazing bad. Starts out ok. But everything gets worse and worse. I know ST is supposed to be a bit cheesy. But in S3 the plot becomes childish and absurd. The acting gets much worse (mostly because of the terrible script), the directing and production also gets worse and worse. All in all, the show is great, as long as you stop watching toward the end of S2.",4 January 2021
"There's way too much drama. Way too few action scenes. The funny bits are not funny. Emotional scenes are boring. The leading characters are praised by everyone in every single episodes and they act like they dont deserve it.

I have to skip the unnecessary dialogues and overly dramatic scenes just to be able to watch it. This series doesnt represent star trek.",1 January 2022
"They turned Star Trek into a soap opera drama. This was supposed to be sci-fi, not a romantic drama. I hope the new series with Jean-Luc Picard will be right.",4 March 2019
"I wasn't sure what to expect from this new Star Trek, another prequel story suggested that perhaps they were afraid of telling new stories, with new technology and more importantly, new ideas. I'm delighted to say that although this is not like any Trek before, that it's thoroughly enjoyable, it's darker, characters will die (not just random red-shirts) and in the first four episodes aired so far we've had betrayal, loss, conflict (both inter-species in the form of the Human/Klingon war) and of the personal kind. This is not a Trek series set in Roddenberry's idealistic fantasy world were everyone on the crew of the Discovery are best friends, far from it...

The characters here are complex, and within these conflicts the show still finds time for humour, as well as some great scenes were characters go head to head. I'm already fully invested in the show, there are some really great ideas here and I genuinely can't wait to see where they take us on this ride, because on the USS Discovery, it could literally be anywhere ;)",14 October 2017
"Seriously, I don't know what they are watching or if they need a ""stickectomy"" but Star Trek: Disc is awesome. I imagine it was how it was always supposed to be; the story lines are great (some really good twists and turns in there), the graphics are amazing, the cast is brilliant!

I'm a huge fan of Star Trek (even that film we don't like to talk about) and I love it, I guess some people just don't like progression!",14 February 2018
"Discovery is an excellent show. The characters have depth and are easy to connect with. The ship is absolutely beautiful and has serious wow factor. The visuals are stunning. The look of the Klingons is different and a little jarring at first, but it's easy to overlook with how exceptional the rest of the show is. Discovery pays homage to Star Trek better than any of the other Star Trek shows. There are Trekkie easter eggs everywhere you look. The format is different from the other shows as it has a season long story arc and isn't an episodic show. Don't be swayed by the keyboard commandos crying and typing away from their mother's basements. All of the supposed inconsistencies and continuity errors are explained or visually represented throughout seasons 1 and 2. It's truly a great show!",18 July 2020
From the opening expose of Klingon..reminiscent of the 1st ST film..this series had me riveted. The production quality..the extremely imaginative and well constructed story lines.. and the culmination of the full story arc.. which made me go back and watch it all over again.. all these factors plus the characters and great acting has me chomping at the bit for series 2.,8 August 2018
"I agree with the many negative reviews claiming that this is not ""the real thing"". I was initially very disappointed with Discovery but once I stopped insisting it had to be what I expected, I started really liking it. So if you want good old fashioned Star Trek then this might not be for you. It IS a bit too woke for my taste but not so much that it destroys the experience.

Update after watching season 3: It just got worse! Season 3 is too much drama and not much Star Trek. Disappointing to say the least.",21 November 2020
"So it's not too bad as a show, elements of Trek of course, but way behind TNG, DS9 and Voyager for me. But if you are a fan, the shocking decision to pull the release outside of North America 2 days awe needs to be punished in the ratings. So This is all I can do. I won't troll with swearing and abuse, but I will down vote the entire show now as a result.",18 November 2021
"I love Sci fi and was looking forward to this so was exceptionally annoyed when in the first episode there was no subtitles used In every scene that the Klingons were talking which was a large part I mean seriously what is the point if you can't understand a word that is said! I even tried downloading English subtitles with the hope it would solve that issue but alas all that transpired was a note saying speaking in Klingon!,,,, ffs what use is that! The irony is the subtitles were fine when translating English! This problem continues in every episode rendering the understanding of what's going on to zilch to the point I have lost all interest",28 October 2020
"Well, at least butt hurt 'true' Star Wars fans are no longer alone in complaining about getting more of the thing they love because it's taken a different direction. As someone who has watched previous ST shows and found them, coupled with standard TV budget special effects, sitting between mildly interesting and boring as s@#t. This new iteration is a breath of fresh air if you don't self identify as being a 'true trekky' and you are looking for something a little different in your TV shows. Visuals superb, plot point nicely done, acting 9/10, set designs, cracking. The only downside to this whole thing is the whining 'true' fans who have dismissed this show after two episodes. congratulations, you are all now on par with 'true' Star Wars fans. Well done. Take a bow.",26 September 2017
"All the hate this show generates are for those stuck in the past and can't cope with change and evolution. We've had a black lead before, and a female lead before, but now a black female is pushing it too far.... a gay couple is also too much for Trekkies to handle... so sad. The writing is brilliant. The way the series took a hard fork halfway through the first season was expertly paced and very well thought out. The new and familiar characters brought in for the second season were welcome additions and I've loved the way the crew have grown in stature throughout the series to date. The third season has also been great so far - 4 eps in and loving the fresh perspective it is being to the Star Trek table - it's the best sci fi on tv only comparable with the expanse but I still take this as the front runner. It's the show I look forward to watching each week. It's the show, when asked, I say is my favourite show on tv. I hope it gets the long run, season after season, that it deserves, much like it's predecessors (ignoring Enterprise). I'm excited where they can take this show..... please continue to blow my mind and expand my imagination with each episode and ignore all the hate. Michael Burnam - Thank you for your service",24 November 2020
"The production is first class, the acting, costumes, special effects and story are first class. CBS cannot be faulted on this production of ST. The fans must subscribe and view STD and provide reviews to ensure STD is not cancelled and we have to wait for 10+ years before someone else creates another ST. STD is pushing the boundaries here, black lead (finally) - never understood why hollywood didn't have black/asian leads before; people dont care about race or gender so long as you can act! (Glen: Walking Dead - amazing). Now, I see that the latest season has 2 black leads (finally) - typical of ST to push boundaries and lead the way; breaking the hollywood mould (I site: first black/ white kiss televised by original ST shatner (I know not 100% real kiss, but still first)). I applaud you STD and wish you all the success in the world, as I do not want to wait for another 10 years for your unwarranted replacement. Much love. xxx",17 October 2020
Can't believe I'm still watching this. It's not Star Trek for sure. Just waiting for next season of The Expanse I guess.,26 November 2020
Amazing! I've been waiting for a modern TV show like this to be available.,26 January 2019
"Some of the so called Trek fans rating this one star are just making fools of themselves and bringing shame to the ideals of Roddenberry who imagined a future where people are open minded and believe in equality unlike most of the negative reviewers on here who if they really have watched it cannot in any universe justify such low ratings.

To give you an objective opinion I would say that anyone who likes sci-fi and has never had any interest in Trek would enjoy this a lot it ticks a lot of boxes. If you have no real interest in sci-fi it still has a fair amount of on screen drama and character interaction to entertain you but its set in space on a star ship so if you turn up expecting a crime mystery or romance you will be disappointed obviously.

If you are a Trek fan your enjoyment will ultimately come down to how open minded you are. If you are unable to accept they will not make a TV show with 1960s CGI and 1960s clothing then best you not watch this. On the other hand if you want to see a very well presented new Trek series in terms of modern CGI and good acting with an interesting story exploring the conflict with the Klingon Empire then you will enjoy it as i did.

On a personal note and my only real negative is I didn't think the Klingon's were that good; there was just something quite wooden and slow about them especially their speech. I know its meant to be deliberate but it can get a little jarringly slow at times. I liked the whole back story and ethos they are developing but its just their wooden movement and talking that lets them down. They are speaking real Klingon so could just be actors struggling with the language...

If i didn't already have Netflix I would get it just to watch this show",28 September 2017
"Season Three has the exact same sort arc for every episode: main character disobeys a direct order from someone in command because she feels her cause is of a higher moral cause and ALWAYS turns out perfectly and she gets away with it. Reality would be court martialed, dishonorably discharged, and likely imprisoned. ""I am woman, hear me roar"" is getting old. We get it, women can do anything a man can do...or at least that's what the writers think....but seriously stop jamming down our throats. Just tell a compelling story with good acting and good action like season one. Nothing more is necessary.",4 May 2023
"So sad to see a modern well shot series ruined by such bad writing and production, I mean you really have to be bad to mess this up, the camera work, special effects & the majority of the actors are great, but the weird plots, endless crying, hugging, whispering and the insane obsession of having Michael Burnham in every shot , makes it so uncomfortable to watch. I would love to know what the actors think, surely they must be saying to themselves ""seriously"" every time they get an episode script. Looking at the 1-2 star reviews here I'm not the only one. I know there was infighting after the first season towards the writing team and 2 producers were sacked and some wannabe called Alex Kurtzman took over ,looks like the original producers were right to criticise the writing team as it's got steadily worse & worse. How any media company can sit down and fund this load of dross is beyond me. The poor actors .",19 January 2021
"Please ignore the 1-star-reviews! This is a clearly NOT a 1star and also no 5star show. Season2 is among the best stuff seen in the past years.

Only explanation I have for all those overly negative reviews that it's a coordinated attempt to discredit this series, maybe a bunch of frustrated Trekkie nerds that have been watching ds9 17 times wearing costumes in front of the TV.

The characters are memorable, witty, much more than ds9 or TNG, even the action is OK (which was really a serious weak point if all previous ST series).

It's the first Star Trek spin off that captures the spirit of the original series, especially from the point on where Pike appears on the scene.

Please watch it - you want be disappointed!",7 April 2020
"As the title suggests I am not a Trekkie but I have enjoyed the legend that has been Star Trek since I was a child on many different platforms. (Games, movies etc. I am 35 years old btw)

I understand the frustration many of the fans with this series. Apparently this series messed up with the cosmology infuriating many die hard fans but I simply cannot ignore the beautiful writing, character development. Finding sci-fi titles to my liking has been torture. (Hard to come by titles like ""The Expanse"" and ""Firefly"")

I am enjoying Star Trek: Discovery massively. I think the writing and the dialogues are brilliants. Yes there are some discrepancies like Klingons punching people without breaking their rip cages as you might expect here and there but they are overlookable for my taste. I know it is really hard for die hard fans to see this series as a standalone title changing the Star Treak formula and appreciate but this is a very good sci-fi.

Doug Jones and Jason Isaacs are brilliant. I also enjoyed the rest of the acting as well. Give it a chance and see for yourself if it is your cup of tea.

But giving it a 1 star rating is very unfair to the writers and people who have imagined this piece of art.",28 December 2018
"1 was ok, 2 was better, and now the 3rd season is amazing! Finally more action than explosions and shootings. More depth than any other Star Trek series.",27 November 2020
"I've watched all the Star Treks, including reuruns of the original series when I was a kid. Then when I was in university, the new Star Trek series began and they were good, with my favourite being Deep Space Nine.

Discovery is just so much better than all the other series in so many ways, it's like a high end movie every single week!

The writing is great, the visuals are the best on TV, and the integration of old and new is incredible!

Near perfection! 9/10",25 July 2020
"Batman, Superman, Spiderman, Sci-Fi in general evolved and finally Star Trek did too! I'm not a ""Trekkie"" but I first saw ST at least 32 years ago. Always watched it, never cared too much for it. Trekkies will probably hate this show.. It's never boring, CGI is great, a lot of action, even SW-like action scenes with multiple space craft shooting at each other. I love the old SW movies and lost all hope after watching the last film. I always thought ST was OK, no more, no less. Now I like ST better than SW!! Never thought I'd say that. There is one episode resembling the old Kirk/Picard era where they go to a planet inhabited by beings made up entirely of energy. I immediately remembered why I always thought ST was a little boring and, yeah so was this episode.

I think, in this case, change is a good thing. ST Discovery is dark, raw and exciting. The characters are refreshing. They have more personality; I've learned more about them in a few episodes then I've learned about the whole Janeway, Picard crew. Not based upon their life stories, but their actions and the choices they make. They feel more ""real"" to me, less stiff than most characters from previous series. Also space travel looks more realistic somehow. I know Trekkies will not agree. I'm a Sci-Fi fan and like I said, never cared so much for ST, but I'm hooked! I can't wait to find out what happens next. The last episode to date was the best ST episode I've ever seen!",13 November 2017
"At the beginning I had high expectations on this one. After the first few episodes I started getting cautious, somehow disappointed and starting to feel that so much on line trolling might be onto some valid points. By the end of the first season I thought there was hope for this. And then came season 2, and it proved me that it was a worthy wait. I really like the characters, the story, the pacing, the visual effects, and I'm genuinely waiting for each weekly episode. The most troubling plot points were somehow better integrated to the whole series, or discreetly managed to be almost left into some distant background. I love Saru and Georgiou, and a Pike series would be something awesome to watch.",9 March 2019
"I am not going completely dump on ""NuTrek"" and Kurtzman. But, they really can, and should do better.

I've been rewatching through TNG, DS9, and VOY, and rewatched season 1 of Picard and all 4 seasons of Discovery. And... Discovery feels like such a shallow facsimile. Yeah, they have a big budget, but they try... too... hard.. The comment that people make about everyone always crying on Discovery isn't because there is anything wrong with crying. I have no problem with it, it's that it is never earned.

Looking back, one thing I never fully appreciated about even TNG, was that while the story wasn't serialized, the characters were. Things happened to characters over the course of a season, so that when a big event occured - you the viewer cared and there was weight to the change. DS9 absolutely mastered this, Odo and Kira paid off because they spent time mastering it. Jadzia's death was tragic, you felt it. By comparison, most relationships on Discovery feel hollow.

I just can't bring myself to like it no matter how hard I try. You can look almost anywhere else for better writing in Sci-fi, and in the start trek universe. They have good ideas here and there, but execution is awful.

All I have to say is DS9 has aged insanely well, (with a few exceptions) I know Ronald Moore is tied up, but surely they can bring back some talent and make an a true effort to bring back some of that magic.",25 February 2022
"I'm a big fan of all Trek, and I was a bit skeptical when I heard that a show was coming out, but I wasn't going to miss out on it. I was really blown away, and fell in love with the characters and most of the story (I've never much liked Mirror Universe, but they did an excellent job). It's unfortunate some wouldn't give it a chance, or just hate it for being new... or genuinely don't like it, that's ok too. But it's so much fun when you love it! It's great to have new Trek. Apparently it did not make as much money as expected, and there is a difference in opinion on whether this show was a hit or not. The biggest complaint I see come up in any forum is CBS - their app - and their exclusivity. Yes, times have changed, and so has the way we view TV - but it just seems like common sense that if this show had been more accessible to a larger audience, at least that's one complaint we could have eliminated and it could have made a big difference. I cancelled the app after sufficient re-watches with a scathing and detailed exit review, and I'll renew it again when the show comes back on out of necessity. Also they did a poor job of providing new fans with any decent or timely form of screen accurate accessories. My complaint is largely with CBS, oddly not the show. I love the cast, the uniforms (and have one to prove it!), and even adjusted to the technology and Klingon upgrade... which I now see the value in. In the end, the adjustments were worth every second watched and loved. The preview for the next season looks amazing, exciting, and maybe they squeezed in a bit more comic relief... looking forward to it!",18 September 2018
"Season 1 started badly and finished well. Season 2 consistently good. Season 3 is a see-saw. Hoping season 4 even things out.

I'm wondering if this series is going to be like the original movies -- odd-numbered bad or mediocre, even-numbered superior? Time will tell.",10 December 2021
"I liked the first series. The program had clearly been given a big budget as can be seen through the impressive special effects. The storyline was well thought through, and I liked the variety of characters.

Season two was not so good. I got the feeling that the writers didn't know where they were taking the show.

Season three was worse. Most episodes were quite frankly boring. The writers were now making it up as they went along.

Season four is a joke! Episode six is one of the worst episodes I have ever seen. The computer having a mental breakdown! We've given up with it. The show will surely be cancelled. Such as shame.",3 January 2022
"All those bad reviews, which I respect their right to express them, prove the majority of those sifi fans are in for lightheaded cruise and can't handle futuristic science. Heck they might even failed their science courses at school. Go watch Mandalorian, if depth cause you headache. The writers involved in that show are so smart and visionary. The only other show on that level is the Expanse",28 November 2020
"Please, please ignore all the hate. It's mostly homophobic, with extra racist and a side sexist for good measure, apparently.

How do you take seriously a rating and subsequent review when they're saying, ""...another gay couple. God knows we need another one."" (1 Star rating) and ""it is so truly woke awful it's unforgivable..."" ""...appeals to a minority of a minority..."" (2 star ratings). I wondered why s4 episode ratings have plummeted, to 1s and 2s no less, and then I read the reviews. Many are blatantly reacting to the ethnic, gender, and sexuality diverse characters. Some are being a little more subtle. When a review says, ""worst sci-fi show ever made"" (1 star rating), the reviewer must have been struck a chord somehow. I've concluded these ratings are purely emotional, an offense based on a deep prejudice. I just don't understand what has become of us.

That said, I love where Star Trek Discovery continues to go, through season four and hopefully beyond. One of the most inspiring, ground and glass ceiling breaking shows on television today. It's an excellent sci-fi story with dynamic character played by talented actors.

I may be biased as a TOS Trekkie since TNG was airing in my 'tween years or... maybe you may be biased if you're not. But, I also love other shows so, Trek or not, I love this show.",18 February 2022
"I haven't read all the reviews, but most people (negative reviews) appeared to want an updated copy of the original. Whats the point, we still have the original.

I'm nearly at the end of the first season, and its great fun. As they've introduced the multiverse so early in its life, unless I have missed something, who says this Star Trek is set in the original Star Trek universe. There are an infinite universe's with an infinite combinations, some subtle, others, like the Teran universe, more major. Personally I don't think it is set in the same universe as the original, as the technology is so more advanced.

But whatever universe Discovery is set in, I shall continue to enjoy the fun.",29 March 2018
"Just finished watching Fargo season 3. In comparison Star Trek's script is plain lazy. No creativity, no vision. Average run of the mill TV show. It's not bad, but it's not good either. I'm in the middle of second season and it's getting more and more boring.",21 February 2021
"Just accept that Star Trek has always had episodes of alternate realities and timelines. The original series explored this. The special effects are great & the early episodes of season two show an emotional depth and story lines that I believe Roddenberry would have approved. The so-called purists have to rewatch the original Trek which clearly espoused many different realities and possible timelines - boldly go people and appreciate the multiverse. Watch 'The Orville' - another Trek multiverse in disguise. Appreciate it for what it is, not what it isn't. Live Long Love & Prosper.",26 February 2019
"As a hardcore Trekkie there's nothing better than seeking out strange new worlds, but in Discovery I can't help thinking that there's a little to much hugging, kissing and crying and not enough of the Star Trek magic. Not every line in the script has to be a theatrical speech, a little less drama and a bit more adventure and this would be an easy 10/10. Just saying.",14 November 2020
"No point trying to rehash how every aspect if this show is garbage. I dont have to because anyone who has seen it by now already knows. I wouldnt have cared if it was some random pukey show like batwoman or the 4400 remake.. but come on, this is (was) star trek!! Now it's nothing but Woke Trek or Agenda Trek, and feeding it to you using a firehose. Season 1, despite many flaws, was decent. Went in the toilet after that. Big money show not worth a can of beans due to pathetic writing, directing, and characters. What a waste.",29 November 2021
"I don't get all the 1 star reviews and moaning about how this isn't Star Trek. Season 2 of this show had probably some of the strongest acting and writing of any sci fi show out there. S3 takes place the furthest we've seen in the cannon, how people are complaining that this show is not about exploration is beyond me. Really good show, please watch s2 and you will not be disappointed",18 October 2020
"It's excellent, fresh and different. Not perfect, the mycellium drive bugs me a little, but certainly no worse than the first seasons of TNG and DS9. But I gotta say, increasingly, my favourite thing about Disco is how much the fan boys hate it, how it's popular with a huge raft of star trek fans that don't care about gender politics or wokeness but just want to see people like them on screen, not a bit part but as main characters, but front and centre.",19 February 2020
"... they took it far far away from Star Trek spirit to the point that season 4 is barely watchable and makes a complete mockery of the series. And I'm not even a huge Star Trek fan... They should rebrand to ""High-schoolers that look old, in space"".",4 January 2022
"I just started watching the show two weeks ago and went through the entire season in 14 days. Every Episode got better. People complaining that it isn't Star Trek are wrong, it is... very much so. Some people just wants all of the dazzle and pop in 3 seconds and this show won't give you that. But if you watch the entire season collectively like I did, the progression is well put together and the story line is amazing. The Star Trek universe does fit in with this show and the show goes into explanation into things that I have always been curious about in the Star Trek universe.

For the people that decided to give up after 2 or 3 episodes, come back and watch it and allow the story to unfold. You will be pleasantly surprised.",13 February 2018
"This Start Trek version is so much more intelligent than the old series, those series look very childish to me now. Very mature themes, more realistic, good acting (with the exception of captain Georgiou) and a great and diverse cast (just like normal society which is called politically correct by some, that is normal except maybe for the US ;-)). Recommended for real SF lovers!

Not for Trump public ......",20 February 2019
Wasn't sure what to expect. Is surprisingly good although it feels like an alternative universe. Visuals are great with some good acting.,22 December 2017
"I have been watching Star Trek from the Captain Kirk days and I've seen all the spinoffs and movies - - I love this show. I love Michael B. Truthfully I would have given Discovery an 8 or 9 depending on the episode, but with all the haters, I had to up my ratings game. Sad sad sad small people who have nothing better to do with their time than to drag a fantastic show, I'm guessing due to a Black Lead. But in spite of this you see it's very Fresh on Rotten Tomato and the overall rating is decent at 7.4. If there was any truth in this space it would have been higher. Anyway, I can't wait for season 3. Have no idea where things are headed, but I miss young Spock already. Live long and prosper Michael.",30 January 2020
"Some of the story lines are special effects are excellent. However, they are trying to turn Star Trek into a moral sappy story with political underpinnings. Please, less sappiness and more action.",18 March 2022
"I am still trying to come to terms with the horrendous hubris of altering the Klingons to some ridiculous abhorrent insult to all star trek fans. The lack of a new story per episode has also added to the general anxiety and constant need to change technology without any consideration for canon. At least with Star Wars new series, they have kept in keeping with the look and feel. This seems to have been created to appeal to an audience that doesn't like Star Trek. I am living in hope that the Captain Pike spin off will keep true to the Original Star Trek and forget this frankly this terrible nightmare of a series. It has lost the Star Trek Mojo. Thank goodness for Picard.",21 January 2022
"I have enjoyed almost all the various Star Trek series that have been on TV since the beginning (maybe except ST Enterprise). Each series had it's own distinct overarching story, and in my opinion, Discovery is developing very nicely. It's not like the other Treks, despite incorporating certain characters and story lines from earlier models. Perhaps not winning any awards yet, but I'd like to see where this one is going. It's enjoyable enough to watch on it's own terms. Hope they continue for at least several seasons - give it a little time to develop and grow, instead of being ""ratings driven"".",24 January 2019
"When I saw that they made a new Star Trek show , I was like okay. First off CBS Access or what ever is having you pay to see this worthless show?

2nd as many have stated Those are not the Klingons that Kirk and crew encountered. More the Next Gen ones. They explained it that the Klingons were growing their hair out. That still don't explain the Klingons 3rd the acting is like watching paint dry. BORING.

4th As someone stated here this show is mostly all about Burnham.

5th I borrowed the 3 seasons from my library. FREE!

6 Season 3 really stunk I ended up fast forwarding through a lot of the drivel.

7 It was time for Philippa Georgiou timeline to end.

8 Who is Carl? Lol I heard that there is a 4th season of the show ,plus Picard and lower decks and now one with Captain Pike. CBS is only green lighting these shows cause it about money I can see why Bryan Fuller left shortly once the show started.

Wouldn't it be nice to see Q or Tribbles or a planet like in the episode Piece of the action.",6 September 2021
What a corny show the acting is terrible the plot it's horrible it's boring it's cheesy my gosh do something better I hope this upcoming strange new worlds goes back to the way it used to be. The serialization let's just have an episodic Series where we can finalize this crap I am so sick of looking at these people on the show they act like idiots there so horrible at acting.,17 February 2022
Yes it's a bit too much crying. But in all its the best Star Trek ever. I never liked it before. Now I do. Obviously the opposite of all the other reviews. For me now understandable.,10 November 2020
This series represents the best version of Star Trek. They go through multiple adventures and each one is unique in its own way. I have only seen season 1 and after watching the season 2 I will update this review accordingly.,9 May 2019
"Once again the ""Hollywood"" peeps have taken a high quality show and ruined it with left-wing politics. Everything written below was BEFORE the hard Left hand turn into crap....

This is the best Star Trek since ""next generation""! I look forward to it every week. I love space and 'Discovery' offers us some glimpses into what may be out there. The second half, of this first season which starts in January, appears to take us on a trip to never before explored space.... AND THAT ROCKS!!!

The Star Trek ""purists"" that think every episode should be about human drama should stick with day time soap operas. Take me to the UNEXPLORED, show me the UNSEEN, RETHINK, REINVENT, LET THERE BE NO Boundaries!!!...including boundaries placed by ""purists"" from the original series...TEAR DOWN THOSE WALLS!!....THINK BEYOND!!!

Graphics, Acting, Stories, are all great. If you love space, you will LOVE this show!",14 November 2017
"I didn't really expect much when I heard that Star Trek Discovery was being made by CBS. I figured it would be dumbed down for the audiences.

However, I admit being dead wrong. This series is great and has improved with each episode. CBS has a great cast and the scripts are intertwined from one episode to the next.

A pity this show is only rated 7.3 on IMDb, it looks like the sci-fi hating trolls have invaded Star Trek Discovery.

Sic-Fi is a tough niche to tackle when it comes to series. But Discovery along with ' The Expanse ' are the two best sci-fi series that have been produced in a long time.",3 November 2017
"No need to elaborate on why I dislike STD so much since everyone else has already expressed my primary sentiments. I'm so disappointed I canceled my CBS All Access subscription. One half season was all I could stand. Please, someone, anyone, give us good new, real (intelligent, well-written, canon-respectful and cohesive) Star Trek!! STD isn't it by a long shot. CBS is clueless... The three stars are exclusively for the special effects.",30 December 2017
"... I miss the individual stories. Burnham is not played well and as she is sort of the main character, this is the show's biggest fault. She lacks the charisma of a leader and come over more like a cute high school girl that has great ideas but is just still a greenhorn ... that get lucky more than she deserves. That is a big mistake, as that is not how the real world works, and with that, Discovery breaks with the valuable ""teaching moments"" that Star Trek was and which made it a special show.",24 November 2021
"Watched 4 Seasons and they have gradually tightened the cast somewhat but its basically not traditional Star Trek. Its soap opera with some sci-fi. Want to see gay characters openly sharing their tribulations as a great portion of the content, then this is your show. Want to see how women now dominate the Trek universe in the future and are the leaders in that world then this is your show. Want to see a Picard or Kirk type character in this universe, well (other than Capt. Pike two extra stars for him), they don't exist simply because you would need to employ writers that understand straight men and Kurtzman is unlikely to do that in this show. If you are a straight young adolescent then it will be impossible to relate to this show.

If you want traditional Trek watch Orville or Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.",21 July 2022
"To those whining about the sex in this series, you must have forgotten how Captain Kirk and Commander Riker was sleeping with all kinds of alien women, throughout the galaxy. And as far as the violence, again, you forget how Kirk was always fighting with an alien, one time even creating a gun to kill an lizard alien. This series is set 10 years before Kirk becomes captain of the Enterprise, when they're at war. So this idea that sometimes you need to commit violence in order to acheive peace, is true. To prove my point, it took violence to defeat the Nazi's to achieve peace, didn't it?",16 February 2019
"Someone commented that those giving this show 6 or above only complain about the Haters.

I'm old enough to have seen the original series first time round. I loved every minute of it and still do Kirk, Spock and McCoy were written and acted perfectly. Pine, Quinto and Urban do a good job in the recent film series.

I remember the buzz when TNG started - a Klingon on the Enterprise! and the worse thing was the change in wording from ""no man has gone before"" to ""no one..."" if IMDB had been around when TNG started it would have been slated.

Deep Space Nine was a departure from the episodic nature if the original and in the main TNG. It seemed to me a reaction the the less idyllic and in my opinion better Babylon 5 ( except the last season ) which was a story ark.

Voyager was OK until 7 of 9 inflamed many teenage boys ( a lots of grown men too )

Finally we have Enterprise with Scott Bakula at the helm. I have a dislike of Bakula from Quantum Leap. Really this was a series too far and should be erased from everyone's memory

So Star Trek Discovery! There are lots of inconsistencies considering it is set before the original ST. But and it's a big BUT don't watch the series thinking you are going to be watching an exact copy - we have iTunes, Amazon and Netflix for that; William Shatner will always be James Tiberius Kirk and Simon Pegg won't be Scotty.

We have two Star Trek like series available at the moment ST Discovery and the superior The Orville. Treat them as they stand you will be far happier.

Also may I make a suggestion - do what I do watch a couple of episodes and if I don't like it don't watch it you will find your blood pressure drops",7 June 2018
"Story lines are very weak, with massive holes, at times the jumps just don't make sense, or the decisions are completely stupid, that no rational person would take that course of action

Burnham is by far and away the weakest lead actor in any Star Trek series

The show lacks feeling, it's very hard to identify with the plot lines, or the actors, I've tried so hard to enjoy or even just like this show, as I'm a real Trekkie fan, enjoyed all the previous series.",20 March 2022
I really enjoyed the first two seasons. Full of surprises and excitement. I love the characters and how the develop. The personal stories add to the richness of the experience. Love Tillie and Spock is tragically sensitive - burying his pain and feelings so deeply he believes they aren't there. The only complaint I have is how they drag out sensitive moments between two people usually including Michael while life and death scenarios explode around them and time is incredibly short. Wasting time and allowing more damage to be done while they emote.,2 January 2020
"The best Trek yet. Worth a watch will keep review spoiler free. I can see that they are looking to appeal to the more broad audience and are definitely going with a more Space Opera feel like BSG or SW. If you are a traditional hard sci fi trekky I can see how this might put you off. That being said, I prefer the story over the science and feel this is a great start to a new series.

If you are offended by women in leadership roles, homosexuality, and violence this may not be for you. Discovery is definitely more raw and gritty than any other Trek series.

Pros Visuials- stunningly beautiful, definitely going for more a an Abrahams vibe and I like that style. Some of these episodes are darker, bloddier, swear words, etc... so be aware of that for younger audiences, but its not over the top. The ""liberal left"" agenda is there, but not in your face. (I lean Right BTW). The too topics are LGBT and Feminism/SIW (strong independent woman). I feel its way better done than what another franchise Star Wars did with the Last Jedi. One big story, rather than episodic. Mulitple Holy $h!t moments, twist, amazing visuals. new technology and cocepts. More battles, less science. Great Story, focus on Klingon War. Sort of ties in with The Original Series.

Great characters with internal conflict, dont want to give away the twist. Burnham is a strong independent women, much better than the other leading female characters in other Sci Fi series *couch* Rey *cough*. A human with vulcan tendancies, that is conflicted with her emotions Ash and his arc with the Klingons. (just waiting for him to get his shotgun and chainsaw hand though j/k) Lorcha- Wow, easily my favorite captain. This is how I see military leaders lead. I personally have found some of the other captians too democratic in their command, that isnt how a military organizatoin works. Plus, Jason Isaacs is great in pretty much everything he does and I have met him in real life, hes a cool guy. Suru- interesting new alien concept, comptent. Paul- brave, compassionate, but possibly over loyal to a fault. Phillipa- another SIW (and i am fine with that), mentor to burnham, great arc as well, dont want to spoil. Cadet Kelly- probably my least favorite, tries to be an over achiver in a kind of way, reminds me of Nom a bit from DS9

The other characters are minor and I felt not fleshed out as much, but the show is still fresh. I imagine we will see more. These include Dr. Hugh, the cyborg and pilot women.

Cons As mentioned Klingons look odd. But i suspect this will change in the future with the Klingon Augument Virus being unleashed at some point.

CBS maks me pay for the app for 1 show. Though in hindsight its definitely worth it.

Honestly thats my only real gripe. I think the hard core Trek fan base is just upset at so much change all at once, much like the new Star Wars films have done. However, IMO, Discovery has portrayed these changes far better than SW.",17 February 2018
"Its not great (yet) but it is still getting it foothold. I have a feeling that it will settle in and find its place. Don't write it off too soon. Something is building, looming, that you will miss if you give up on it now. stick in there, it's coming, its just taking it/s time to do it.",11 February 2018
"This new iteration of Star Trek in Discovery, started off strong - and just got better episode after episode. It really does show imagination and superb writing along with spot on casting to bring us this new insight into the Star Trek Universe.

Society is ever evolving, and so it stands to reason that how things are presented to us needs to evolve, so that it feels relevant, and not simply trying to repeat the past with storylines that worked then.

Had to let a bittersweet laugh out reading the reviews by the prehistoric neanderthals who whined like scorned sissies about the fact that Star Trek dared to venture into themes like homosexuality and human emotions connected with different sexualities.

'They' come up with tripe like ""What would Roddenberry have thought about this..would be turning in his grave..""

*NO* He was a person of vision, who went against the grain and tried to encompass all parts of humanity into the original series. Having a black woman who was a main part of the bridge crew, all different nationalities representing the rest - he believed in equality, NOT stupdity. In his day however, he would never have been able to sell the notion of introducing varying sexualities into the main storyline, but without doubt were he alive today..?

He would be proud both of the show's capacity to develop with the times, whilst also retaining the true spirit of Star Trek, and what it means to be a part of a Federation who accept all people without prejudice, bigotry, ignorance..or homophobia !!

The tone of this show is certainly the darkest in many respects, yet manages always to come back to the founding principles of Star Fleet and the Federation as a whole. They really did invest a lot of time and passion into bringing the Star Trek universe forward in a way which has relevance in today's world, whilst not forgetting to take us on a rollercoaster of a ride throughout.

Added to the terrific scripts and performances, we now have the added little luxury of seeing everything in fairly terrific HDR...I said 'fairly' because whilst good, it's not the forerunner in this one regard..but that is a point of pedantry now ;-)

I hope this show gets to run for a good long time to come, because on present form it really does deserve to be allowd the chance to spread it's wings.

Shame about the homophobes and other assorted fools who have to mark it down because of their own limited and small minded biases. Exactly the sort of people Roddenberry fought against when bringing us Star Trek in the first place !!

Live Long & Prosper Discovery !!",15 February 2018
"This is a perfectly enjoyable reimagining of the Star Trek universe. Yes, I get why some people don't like it, but it's a new story and requires suspension of disbelief just like all of the other versions that came before.",28 October 2020
"Why, why, why? This is supposed to be earlier in the timeline, but the technology is more advanced than what came later. Utterly ridiculous to have a ship that can jump locations rather than travel using warp drive. The Klingons looked completely different. What was the point of changing everything. Give this series a different name and move it out of the Star Trek universe. It has nothing in common with any of the original series. YUCK is the best word to describe this show.",3 March 2021
"Great cast, great stories and story arcs, great CGI. Awesome references to the original series and set up of things to come. Why would people want to hark back to squeaky wooden sets where you can hear the studio toilet flush. This is Sci Fi - not protecting listed buildings.",22 April 2019
"When Discovery premiered I held off because I didn't want to subscribe to another streaming service for a single show. But I subscribed for the sake of Picard, and figured I might as well catch up on Discovery as well. It's a bit of a mixed bag for me, but getting better as it goes. I must admit some of the canon violations bother me. I wish they'd set the show further along in the timeline, rather than making it a prequel. But some of the characters are growing on me. And it's nice to see them trying something new.",27 January 2020
"I decided to try this out because I am fan of both Sonequa Martin-Green and Jason Isaacs as actors.

The first episode started off well and I was impressed with the special effects and sets. Yes, it is different from the original in terms of the setting and grittiness. That's both a plus and a negative at times - like the change to the kligons (which looks cool but makes no sense).

But........then the first episode is ruined by the attempted mutiny and ridiculous prisoner storyline, which kind of sets the expectations for the show. Also, this story arcs was completely unnecessary and forgotten by episode three.

The stories in the following episodes are NOT compelling. These ""officers"" have no military bearing, constantly bicker, cry and whine constantly. It doesn't have to be the army, but it shouldn't be like siblings arguing all the time - there is a reason I left home! It's like the stereotypical millennials in space. Every order is debated and complained about, or there is the required virtue signaling. There are also too many flashbacks, Vulcan mind melds, and scenes of pointless drama and dialogue between characters. It makes it both boring and somewhat obnoxious.

Also, I find naming a female character Michael is somewhat distracting and ridiculous. It is emblematic of the bad writing, story arcs and terrible dialogue.

I left it on while working as background noise and didn't really miss anything. I think I'll save myself the time and skip any future seasons.",7 May 2023
"I'm a Star Trek gan. This show is quite different from the previous ones. But, still, it's great. Great actors. Great stories. Lavish sceneries. Fabulous special effects.",23 January 2021
"I don't understand the reason for the intense hatred here. The show was very intelligent and involved serious speculative science as the basis for many of the episode ideas. The almost mystical approach of using a biological panspermia which is networked across all dimensions as the means of travelling instantaneously is bold and powerful. The Klingons have become real, and their militaristic demeanors are examined more realistically than ever before.

Besides all that, the images we see on the screen are visceral, moving, and simply beautiful.

I would take this show over all the other lame dross that everyone seems so eager to preserve, with Roddenberry's vision unviolated. To hell with that!! Viva Star Trek Discovery!",3 April 2018
"There is a lot of controversy and unmerited criticism floating around Star Trek:Discovery. Yet again, a spin-off meets with opposition from quarters rigidly entrenched in the mini-philosophy of the original series, complacent and self-sufficient and lacking the required flexibility of mind and imagination only a true trekkie can exhibit with honesty. Thankfully, the script writers have taken over the thread from previous iterations and have developed one truly immersing trekkie experience, red threaded with the principles of the Federation and blended with the type of human behaviour extrapolations we have already been accustomed to throughout the franchise. Superbly acted, eye-popping special effects and ever-keeping-you-guessing story lines, the usual high calibre cinematic experience showing reverence to the public, of both virgin trekkers as well as already dedicated fans, by offering an exhilarating visual feast and deeply satisfying. 10/10",28 December 2019
"Edit:

This needed to be said that season 4 is much more like the Star Trek we know and love. Its almost as if the writers finally got around to watching DS9 and TNG after 3 seasons. Now if they just shortened the inter-personal filler during conflict scenes, we would have a great show.

Original review:

There are trekkies which believed that Star Trek was perfect the way it was represented before in TOS and TNG, and there are trekkies who knew that Star Trek needed to change and evolve if it had any hope of reinventing itself for a modern audience.

The ones who believe the former will probably not like this show, but they aren't being realistic. For Star Trek to have a future it needed to change and explore new social issues and ideas. However, the major complaint for many is how far the new material strays off the canon.

Unfortunately Discovery strayed off canon by a large margin in season 1. It was if the show was written by people who had never watched an episode of DS9 or Enterprise, people who didn't know the history, the timelines and the principles of Starfleet. And even the flashy new CGI and decent performances couldn't save it.

This continued into season 2 as well, but by the end of the season 2 something changed.

I don't know whether or not they decided to change up Burnhams character to make her more likeable, whether they decided to move back more into the sciency as opposed to dramatic personal relations or whether or not they started listening to writers who knew their trek history and lore, but things started to gel. It may have been the fact that in a new unexplored time, they could create their own story and build upon the existing worldbuilding, instead of trying to slot into an existing time zone which already had existing lore - especially if they didn't have much knowledge of it in the first place.

But what it has done is eventually they have arrived at a pretty good series. Whilst season 1 and 2 were failed writing experiments, it gave time for the crew to settle into their roles, and by season 3 you can start to become sympathetic to characters which we previously didn't care much about.

There are still issues with canon, but now they are seemingly inconsequential. Hope it continues into season 4 and beyond.

Season 1: 7/10 Season 2: 7/10 Season 3: 9/10.",17 December 2020
"I first came across this series as an extra feature on a disc for another CBS series - just the first episode as a promo. I was not taken with it. It seemed so slow, and without an aim, that I sort of lost interest partway through. Then, I guess, the relationship (mother/daughter?) between Georgiou and Burnham caught my attention and I bought the first series. After a really clunky start the series got into gear. In the next few episodes we developed a team, a family - just what a long running TV series needs.

I have to say for me that this is the best title sequence of all the Star Trek series, surpassing DS9. The theme music has been superior on all series, but the Leonardo-style graphics really caught my imagination and the music was well blended in to reflect the earlier incarnations.

I have a couple of issues!

Sylvia Tilly: Really! No offence meant to anyone called ""Tilly"", but for someone who was going to become a major character, couldn't the writers have found a last name that is not the diminutive of Matilda?

Sloppy writing: at the first conference: ""the war has waged on"" ? Really? Someone wages war, war does not wage itself. Something more suitable would have been ""the war has continued on"", or given the meaning maybe, ""the war has struggled on"" but the writers (and their sub-writing staff) couldn't be bothered to work out the right words for what they wanted to say.",5 October 2021
"Star Trek Discovery is an epic evolution...which is what Star Trek IS all about.

Think about it: When Star Trek originally came out, it was all about innovation and pushing the envelop; it was cutting edge for the time. Discovery is the first Star Trek series in a while that has started to push that envelope again.

Ignore the negative reviews. They are mostly written by people that are too stuck in the past. Notice that the naysayers complain it isn't like the previous series.

It has been high time for Star Trek to evolve. Enterprise (and the new trilogy of movies) started that new direction and it was fantastic.

It has been 20 years since DS9, almost 30 years since TNG, and over 50 years since the original series. While I love those shows and they were culturally relevant at the time, they are not as relevant now, and similarly, new Star Trek series' need to reflect the changes in society and cinema technology.

Do these complainers think a show isn't supposed to evolve in a period of half a century? Come on now.

Society evolves, and science fiction has to as well.

In my opinion, Star Trek Discovery is downright epic. Watch it for yourself and draw your own conclusions.",30 October 2020
"TV-MA - Star Trek with ""F"" words? That was very disappointing. It may be that references to God have been left out of the franchise, but having watched all Star Trek movies and series, am sure that episode 5 is the first ""F"" word. Hollywood seems to consistently ignore Article 134 of the UCMJ: Swearing is now and has been for what seems like forever, not just offensive, but also an offense. On another track, if this is supposed to be ten years before Capt Kirk, the tech is way too advanced to really fit: nice graphics, but unbelievably not ten years before.",16 October 2017
"I liked seasons 1-2 but it has gone downhill thereafter. 3 was just ok, but 4 is unwatchable! They got way from makes Star Trek great and now spend the majority of every episode in lengthy, drawn-out conversations that are whiny and self absorbed. I don't know it they lost writers or if the writer have lost their way, but I'm sick of endless hours watching the characters exploring internal angst. There in 10 minutes of story in each hour-long season 4 episode.",20 February 2022
"Some of these people reviewing this series are clearly retarded. It's like they want a remake of something that's been re-made a thousand times. Star Trek Discovery is SUPERB!! HOW IS THE ACTING WOODEN? Sonequa Martin-Green is a class act, Jason Isaacs is perfect for his role, all I can think of is you're watching it whilst playing Minecraft on your phones or something.

DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE CLUELESS IDIOTS GIVING IT ONE STAR! It's one of the best Sci-fi's I've seen in ages. The plot is very clear, the acting is exactly as it should be, and it shows the original plenty of respect, WITHOUT copying what's already been done.",27 October 2017
"I watch this show because I love Star Trek and this series is actually better than ""Enterprise"" in my opinion, but that's about it. None of the characters are interesting or relatable, except for Saru. Saru is pretty much the only reason I still watch it. They brought in Spock and now they are trying to save the Galaxy. So I guess that's a little interesting too. *shrugs* The Orville is actually more interesting and a better show. I look forward to watching that and forgetting about STD a lot of the time.",10 March 2019
"If you're a star trek fan, this show is not for you. Actually, it not for anyone and I wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy. Bad acting with even worst writing. Effect are poorly done and could have been much better. The plot is so convoluted and the script really takes you out of it.",23 May 2021
"It's a great show! Take it for what it is and enjoy it! Just because every tiny aspect doesn't fit into their perfect little idealistic Star Trek world doesn't mean it isn't good. There's no good reason why Gene Roddenberry wouldn't like this show.

"This is my second review of Star Trek Discovery and I hate to break it to the 1,2 and 3 star reviews but this is Star Trek.The production is outstanding,the writing and character development are actually improving and yes it is the Star trek universe dragged kicking and screaming into the twentieth century.It is so frustrating to see low star reviews of this excellent series.Keep that up,it'll be cancelled and you'll moan about the lack of Star Trek on TV. I've actually watched all of Star trek in the last eighteen months,Deep Space Nine and Voyagers finales are both absolutely terrible,no offense to the cast and crew but they have not aged well at all (the series not the actors). Discovery's production exceeds practically all of the original movies up to and including the most recent ones.Last point,returning to plot and writing Star Trek beyond has a terrible plot,no comparison to Discovery yet I still wouldn't rate it less than 6.",22 January 2018
"I have no clue why all the trekkie groupies are raging. This show is excellent. Shows an inhumane side of what it means to be at war. And the tough decisions in it. Some plot twists could've been better.

Sure it might not be exactly vanilla Star Trek, but still. its the best Star Trek i've ever seen.",10 February 2018
"I grew up on 'Star Trek', and I've been thrilled by every series which has ensued. The first two series of 'Discovery' were equally as thrilling, and though I have enjoyed series 3&4 somewhat, I feel it unnecessarily tries too hard to make various points such as gender identity and sexuality. One of the many reasons I have enjoyed 'Star Trek' throughout the years, is the inclusion and embrace of all races, creeds, genders, abilities, disabilities etc, incorporated into riveting storylines, and done so effortlessly.

I refer to an episode in (season 5 I believe) of 'The Next Generation' titled 'The Outcast' which addresses gender identity, and is very well presented.

Any genuine 'Star Trek' fans such as myself, do not need to be convinced of anybody's worth or right to be, despite our/their differences, 'Star Trek' IS a celebration of our similarities and differences, with the added bonus of intelligent storylines.

I look forward to series 5, and in the meantime, live long and prosper 🖖🏻",13 July 2022
This show is the best! The story is awesome! The writing is fantastic and the visuals are top notch! Every week has me more excited to hear as the next episode. These episodes are an hour long and feel like 10 minutes! I just can't say enough! Star Trek is back and better than ever! If the hater cat see that then they need to get their eyes checked!,7 March 2019
I really enjoyed the tv series as had good battles. Hard sci fi and the budget seemed appropriately good The second season seemed very discombobulated though and the overall plot was very weak and a bit silly,26 September 2019
"First of all, I grew up with Star Trek and I watched it religiously every Sunday evening. Many years later, after watching Discovery series I have to say that this is better than the original. The cinematography is stunning, from camera angles to special effects. Lastly, the characters development is masterfully done. I have also enjoyed the Klingon language and I found them as a species done in a very believable way. The intro is done to an artistic level and you can tell how much detail went into this show.

I have to say that this show is on the same level with Battlestar Galactica and I look forward to what comes next. I can highly recommend it to any SF fans!",30 September 2017
"I am a fan of all Star Trek series. My impression of this series is I kinda feel like there is too much emotions brushing. Too emo for my taste. It could have been better without those too much emo lines, dragging the whole story along for characters but rather focus on strong leadership, logical thinking and twists like most of the Star Trek series in the past. I would still watch the upcoming new season but I just hope they would get back and live up to the standard stories of the past so fans like me would definitely feel like home when watching this. The actors are pretty awesome. I am sure they delivered the best they can.",13 February 2023
"Well, as majority here I was not happy at all with first 2 episodes. No need to repeat here what others already wrote. So, I decided to watch e3 yet, and if no improvement - adios. And it is really better. Fur instance title now fits - so far it was: so-so Star Trek, War against Klingons. It even starts to have some sense. I think that acting is fine, and leading actress is likable - well except stupid name choice. Indeed, there is too much female for some military spaceship (no, I'm not sexist, just realistic). They trying something new, but it's hardly better in most of cases. And, yes, technology is way too advanced for TOS prequel. I don't see why it can't happen many years later. Rating: 5 . Episodes 1-2 max 2. And after episode 4 : even worse than e1-2. Story, script, even editing are poor. That rescue mission and defeating of Klingons was presented so lame. Hopefully will be no season 2.",4 October 2017
"Pros Well developed characters Big themes Serious tone Well performed and dramatic Good make up and effects

Cons

Too serious, needs humor and to ground itself. Needs more ""discovering"" new life and new civilizations for trekkers, and less appealing to Star Wars action fans.

It's a good show and I enjoy it. I just want to see more Star Trek nerdy stuff and less cool actiony big theme ""end of the universe destruction"" stuff. I do like however, the reimagining of the Klingons. Took the spirit of the race and made it feel real, instead of the bad, corny, Christopher Lloyd style that makes them seem idiotic. Don't get me wrong I liked the performances, but the make up for me was a tad unintimidating.

Good show but don't forget what who and what you are.",5 January 2019
"For those who hated season 1, I highly recommended giving it another shot this season. The new show-runners have corrected many of the complaints that those who didn't like season 1 had. The Klingons look much more like they should, they show has gone back to the exploration side of the Trek world, they've fixed several of the continuity errors, & the new arc about the Red Angel is very interesting & keeping the pace of the show going. It has become must-watch TV in my household. Is it TOS or even TNG? No, it isn't. Yes, it's doing doing some new things not done before in a Trek Series, but so what? If you want a rehash of what you've seen before, go watch re-runs! If you want a show that has something interesting to offer & new to say, while still capturing the feel of Trek, give season 2 a try! It is much better than season 1, & from a visual perspective it has been mind-blowing. I've been floored by how every episode has felt more like a feature movie than a television series. (And btw, no I do not work for CBS, as I'm sure some haters will say while refuse to give it another chance. I'm simply a stay-at-home dad who is a big ST fan & appreciates having new Trek to watch & gave the show a chance to find its footing, which season 2, IMO, has definitely done.)",1 March 2019
I was very critical of this show at first but the story is excellent and if you give it a chance it explains most of the reasons for anything that seems odd.,8 February 2019
"Season 1 and 2 were amazing! They were not like the old Star Trek tv series and break the mold but were amazing to look at and full of excitement!

However, things took a huge downturn in Season 3. The biggest issue is that it turned into a SJW's wet dream that promoted left wing American ideals (I'm not American myself).

There were 0 straight white male characters on Discovery in Season 3. Think about that for a second. The only straight white male characters in the entire season were the bad guys and they had very little screen time. We got a character that was called ""they/them"" (ridiculous), gay characters, black characters, and mostly females ran Discovery (and one alien). It was so overboard it became unwatchable as the plot itself was also very weak.

I went from a huge fan in the first 2 seasons to actually hating the show in the 3rd and forced myself to watch all of it.

My rating of S1 and S2 is 9 stars My rating of S3 is 5 stars

Average rating is 7 stars.",10 September 2021
"Being a trekkie I find it hard to write anything negative regarding the started franchise, that being said I will give you my honest take on this series. The over dramatic acting that the character Micheal Burnham portrays who is the main character is too much to take at times, the over emotional reactions and her literally crying in every episode does nothing for the show and is one of my biggest annoyances in the show. Fortunately the other characters in the show make up for it with their amazing performances and believable character portrayals that each of them bring to the table. One of my top characters in the show is Dr. Stamets, the actor who plays him has done such an amazing job he's not only created a connection with the audience but also a depth to the character that has matured since to first season to be who he is today. Then we need to go to the actress who plays Philippa Giorgio, the ultimate badass and was the villian to which the audience ultimately ends up cheering for. I cannot believe that she was written out of the show and pretty sad about that I noticed that Jonathan Fracks (stng) had directed the 3rd season 12e which was notably awesome so hopefully he'll be directing more to come. He brings the a bit of the undertones of the next generation and of him knowing roddenberry and working with him personally brings some of that with him that Discovery was maybe missing.",3 January 2021
"And I wrote that it's an abomination :) And you know what guys - I had too much time on my hands and gave it a second shot. In two days I watched it all, starting from the beginning (last time I didn't manage to go past ep. 3) and by the last one I was looking for info on season 2.

I'm a hard-core Star Trek (all of them) fan. And I remember when I was about to watch Voyager and then The Original and finally Enterprise series for the first time - I had so many ""buts"" - in the first case that the captain was a woman in the second that it was so vintage and the last one was just mweh. And now - all the series are a background noise in my home, almost every day and I have all Star Treks on the loop, like over and over again - whatever I do :)

So when the disgust of the new Klingons (why? I still don't understand WHY???) and tons of special effects washed away from my system, I was ready to watch. And I found almost everything I love in the previous STs - friendship, compassion, funny moments. Obviously - they are shown in a different manner. But hey - so many haters, still hate Captain Kathryn Janeway or the whole Enterprise crew! It took time to get used to the new ones - in my case longer than I expected and with a hiccup or two on the way.

But I'm ready for the new season - especially that I saw glimpses of ""normal"" or ""almost normal"" Klingons - the ones I love :)",24 October 2018
"Purist score: 4 The utterly uncharacteristic noirish setting, a command bridge that not only appears to be 10 times the size of the Enterprise NCC-1701 but at least 10 years more advanced than the original series flagship, (rather than ten years behind it as advertised), other various forms of technology unfamiliar to the time line, and a disquieting pervasive lack of emotion, human and otherwise, (where's the damn doctor?), pull my purist score down to barely acceptable.

Entertainment score: 7 An engaging, even if somewhat restrained, 2 episode premiere that manages to avoid predictability definitely piquing interest in future episodes, and whether or not the cost of admission is too high.The series is obviously settling in for a long run, (15 episodes in 2 chapters). The premiere episodes make you wanna see more. But fans have waited 12 years for another small screen version, waiting another year for the DVD, or Netflix USA to catch up, might be more palatable than gambling another $6 bucks a month on a big fat maybe.

Actors: 7 I blame that low score on the directors and producers. A capable cast. But? Is everybody supposed to act like Vulcans? You call that a doctor? He looks about 15 years old. What there is of him to see. The big screen reboot didn't even try to pull that off. Dammit Jim! Somebody's gotta act like there's a human heart beating underneath all that tightly pressed figure hugging political correctness. Even the Klingons sound wooden. Somebody needs to channel them some Worf. Seriously.

Writing: Net score 4. 7 minus 3 for dialogue the likes of which haven't been heard since Star Trek: The Motion Picture. I mean...puhlease. Barely even a grin. A pun. The first ten minutes is as good as it ever gets. That needs work.

Adds up to an average of 5.5 that I'll round up to 6 for potential. Definitely has potential. But this fan isn't going to cough up another $6 bucks a month to line CBS' pockets. I'll wait it out.",25 September 2017
"Why must Michael whisper all the time? I'm willing to suspend disbelief long enough to accept the anachronisms, the contradictions with the other series, even the inconsistency within the motives and actions of the characters, but WHY MUST MICHAEL ALWAY WHISPER? I know from watching TWD that Martin-Green is not much of an actor. Does she think that's what acting ""serious"" or ""dramatic"" looks like? Who's directing this? It's very annoying.",27 November 2020
"Going into this series I was sceptical. As a huge fan of TNG VOY DS9 and the rest, previews looked like this was heading into territory of the ST films which I enjoyed but did not think were great Trek.

The first few eps did not do much to remedy this bad first impression. Everything about DIS screamed star wars in ST universe. Action! War! Space battles! Lens flares! Basically everything the ST films were notorious for (good or bad).

However, having come up at episode 10 I must say this series turned itself around majorely. Theres still a focus on the war and action elements to a degree, but they also managed to slip in good old ST conundrums and made it feel a bit more smart and less action focused. Without spoiling too much, theres a bit of borrowing for TOS lore and also other ST tried and true tropes, but is exuted well.

I feel this series has really grown into its own. While its not as pure ST as some may like, in the later eps especially it has moved to a sweet spot of interesting scifi ideas and also action/adventure. The characters are good, the writing is smart and fun, and of course the sets and costumes ate gorgeous (though still not sure if I agree with the klingon design).

Recommended for both ST fans and the rest of rv viewers!",12 January 2018
"The moment I got to know that the episodes are out. I totally freaked out..screaming with excitement. I couldn't wait to start watching. Finished the 2 episodes and checked the ratings to see others were as excited as I was.. and boy was I disappointed.

1) STOP COMPARING- I love all the star trek versions. You don't have to compare all of them. They are all awesome. I hate comparing sequels. If they removed the name star trek and showed it to you.. I am sure the ratings would be different.

2) STOP GIVING SHITTY RATINGS - This for people who are rating it below 5. This series definitely does not deserve a 1. The minimum rating I can think of is probably 5 or 6. The 'purists' need to stop cribbing. You are rating it 1 because it is too futuristic? I mean come on!

After a long time, a star trek series came out....PLEASE don't make them cancel it because of your crazy high expectations! Stay in this universe... Live long and prosper!",26 September 2017
"I've picked it on Netflix because of curiosity, what can be nowadays done with this campy format... Is there any way to revive this cold dead idea for space opera? In my eyes Star Trek for years was just mix of fantasy/sci-fi with Dallas or... More A-Team in outer space, something made to last as 3-act for 900 episodes all played around same idea - victims of failed make-up artist chat for 45 minutes standing in room filled with flashy buttons, consoles, all against a large screen or maybe huge window with HUD - intended to impose spaceship bridge. Sometimes this room shakes or alarm is turned on to add some action and show that it takes place in outer space. I was also fascinated by idea that all aliens around universe speak english even those contacted for first time ever, most of them are humanoids or to be frank just actors with rubber masks and foolish outfits. I am not sure which seasons were worst? Those from 60's where campy, those from 80 felt just cheap, i think series from 90s overkill's em all with weak CGI which pushed boundaries of bad TV series beyond borders of known universe.

And now we got this reboot. And is it what I expected? Another cr*p made in a ""Star Gate"" manner? (Star Gate should have its own place in Wikipedia as synonymous of bad TV franchise.) Verdict is: absolutely NO.

Discovery is quite decent Netflix filler. It might not amaze people who do not like scfi, cgi and heroes chating about hyperspace and time paradoxes but it's as I sad quite decent position for those who do have fun watching space battles.

Since cinematic reboot Star Trek series got grip and tends to go in right directions. It still have some flaws of original but I would risk to say that producers, art directors and designers made far better choices than people who make new Star Wars series. Funny thing, as a kid I always thought of myself as guy with hype for original Lucas Trilogy, I hated Star Trek with its saturated candy suits, shiny spacecrafts, flat and boring screenplays. Now I can honestly say it's played in far much better way than SW. One important disclaimer when it comes to Discovery.

Important notice to people who wrote episode 07 of S01, its really ""Magic to make sanest mad go mad"". Seriously? They let go Intergalactic con man and thieft who assaulted Star Fleets finest ship, and killed its capitan over 50 times? Not only they let him go they give him warm farewell with his girlfriend. Same time main heroine is called mutinier and murderer because of her failed try to save universe. Word of advice, please don't treat viewers as complete fools.

As for the rest - for now it's best series up to date.",7 April 2019
"Unlike most of the past star treks, discovery follows a season long plot line instead of being episodic in nature like in the past. I think this is the direction that the new shows should be going for, as nobody really wants to watch a show that goes episode by episode. They want to become invested in the characters and the storyline.",14 December 2021
"Star Trek has always been a ""ride for the mind"". It has left us with a lot of WOW moments in our lives. Discovery is no different on that matter. The 6 stars I give go for the storylines, the effects and the suspense. The 4 stars they did not get is because just like so much of this ""Snowflake"" Generation and the adaption of throwing PC crap down our throats, that is the top priority when they put out shows in this era and this one is full of it. It is hard to look past all of that while you are trying to watch the heroes battle their way through and on to the next episode. I do think a lot of people in the world are becoming more and more desensitized to it everyday. It would help if we could just get there a little faster so that they can earn back those 4 stars.

UPDATE: After watching Season 4, overall, the action is great, the effects are great, but the writing is so boring. This show spends more time being touchy feely than I like. It is good to have it, but the way the show is constructed, you can pretty much watch the timeframe and know that all of the mushy stuff comes at the same times. I do like the show, but I think it is more because it is a part of the Star Trek World.

UPDATE: Watching the current season, it seems there is a shot of action/drama and a little less ""My Feelings Need To Be Heard"" I really like the fact that some of the crew are getting to step up and be more involved in the stories and not just back drop. Getting better.",9 January 2021
"As a life-long trekkie I was genuinely entertained by S1-3 and very impressed by the writers' ability to squeeze new, original (and sometimes better) ideas from a franchise that's already 50 years old. The vast, multi-layered story arcs were intriguing and it was refreshing to see Star Trek literally 'boldly going' in a brave new direction. Even the overly gothic (and somewhat disturbing) Klingon material, the knife in the guts scene and the underwhelming finale to S3 were forgivable. But Star Trek: Discovery is now The Michael Burnham Show (with Star Trek). Whatever experienced hands of guidance were once on the reins have let go, the immature have been put in charge and S4 has a cheap, plastic feel as a result. Starfleet is a fictional organisation but it still has standards which are now being ignored - could you honestly imagine Picard handling a diplomatic mission the way Burnham did in S4 E1? Do you remember Riker scolding La Forge for not standing to attention when delivering an official report? Compare this with Tilly flapping her hands and giggling when she's got a good idea - then everyone talking about their feelings and crying. Maybe the underlying mission to use this beloved franchise as a vehicle for yet more woke politics has finally been accomplished and the writers simply can't be bothered anymore. Whatever has happened, it's a shame that STD and the franchise itself has ended up like this - but as any trekkie will remind you, 'All good things...'",27 November 2021
"Good Lord. There are a lot of people saying they can't continue to watch this show and how it is garbage.

It is flawed. Particularly Season 1. They have made mistakes in the story and how it unfolds. Michael (why a male name for a female character) is Spock's adopted sister. Why do that? Just so that it ties in TOS? Mistake. Burnham is what American's call a ""Mary Sue"". Yes, at times that is correct. Mistake by the writers. How would Tilly ever at on Starship? A deeply irritating character. Mistake by the writers. Don't get me started on the Klingons.

However, there is Season 2. There is Capt. Christopher Pike written and portrayed brilliantly. There is the development of Saru and a few of the other characters. The universe still seems to revolve around Michael Burnham to a degree but less than in Season 1 and she is less of a ""Mary Sue"", and as such, becomes a better character. Did I mention Capt. Pike by the way? We have less stupid Spore Drive and more Star Trekking in Season 2 and with changes at the helm I have hopes for even more improvements in the next season.",25 November 2019
"Why ruin another show! It started okay and the first Season was okay, the second season was...well okay but now we have people that are move interested in sprouting their ideological fascist ideas. It is garbage and I can't watch it. Sack the show runners and start again...Please!",13 March 2022
"I'm noticing a majority of the 1 star hate ratings are from sep/oct after only a few episodes. How can you rate an entirely new series so soon? If you wrote a review prior to watching more that the opening few episodes your rating is negated. That applies to 10 star as well. Anyway, having given the show a chance to get on its feet I am thoroughly enjoying it. If it destroys Trek canon for you, fine, rename it in your mind. The visuals are beautiful. The design is fresh. The acting very well done. The music is full of original trek quotes. And the story intriguing so far. The reviews ranting on and on about 'why did we never hear about the spore drive', etc.... Do you really think writers and producers at this level are not aware of that? You didn't even give the show a chance to explain itself. This is solid TV Sci-Fi (which is in short supply - The Expanse and Altered Carbon being our saviors right now) and could be a fun watch for any fan of the genre if only you could get some quality Xanax. No, I don't think it's perfect, nor was I paid by CBS to write a positive review. One issue I do have is the spoken Klingon language. It's so desperate for uniqueness, yet is sounds like they are choking on their own tongues in slow motion. But the Klingon design.... we have seen many faces over the years and I think the show does a great job blending the many looks into something new yet familiar. I am definitely looking forward to where the story heads next.",13 March 2018

I am a sci-fi author, and the writing and look of this series rocks!!",8 March 2019
"The season 2 story arc was incredible and by the end it paid off big style. Everything about this season was spot on and the snooze-fest of season 1 was consigned to history. If you are a fan of the original, where season 2 ends up will leave you ultra-satisfied.....",4 May 2019
Every episode the main characters are talking too much in seek of empathy and this is irritating.,16 June 2021

"As a long time fan of Star Trek I find this show enjoyable. It's very engaging though has its flaws like anything else.

--------------------- Pros: They didn't turn it into a straight-up action show like the recent feature films which I was very happy about.

We get to see familiar characters (Pike/Spock/etc) alongside a few interesting new ones (mainly Saru though. He is a great character)

Cons: Many of the characters are difficult to like. In several of the original shows I liked almost every single character. In this one most characters are just bland with a few that stand out. Luckily there is a decent story happening that makes this no so difficult to ignore.

In my experience the best part of the original series, and many of the follow-up series', is the change to see them dedicate whole episodes to explore new worlds and base a whole story around that. In this one we see them more interacting in space with most of the story happening solely among the ship.

-------------------- My favorite episode so far has been Season 2 Episode 2 ""New Eden"". This felt a lot like New Generation. I very much wish more of the show fell in line with this episode.",23 February 2022
Note to all who produce this version of Star Trek: please please stop. It is probably too late yo keep from destroying the legacy and concept of Star Trek; but please stop anyway. It is painful.,9 January 2022
First two episodes are rough then it gets amazing bthe second season was so badass. Such a great show.,8 March 2020
"Season 3 and 4 are too far fetched with some annoying characters and conclusions to the story.

Shame because first 2 seasons are really good.

I feel Star trek strange new worlds is far superior and if anything feels more like the The original ST and ST next generation.

Don't think I will watch a season 5 of discovery because too many characters have become annoying, especially the Captain Michael.",3 July 2022
"I'll start with the pros because there isn't many. The updated look of The Enterprise under Captain Pike is great. One of the best looking ships. Captain Pike is the only Character that works.

The cons. I COULD say everything else and be done with it but I'll give a basic overview.

Characters are not even forgettable, you literally do not know most of their names for the first season, they make an attempt in season 2 but are never mentioned again, and barely said in season 3 with the sole exception of the main 5. Most of them are bland background characters on the bridge and the main 5 are all over the place, especially in season 3 where there is a lot of weird emotional ranges. Has an odd tendency to focus around the female characters, which isn't bad, but because you don't know who they are, what they like and hobbies etc... It's just a relegation of the lesser known men in the series. Season 3 the main character seems to be this all powerful person even dictacting to an Admiral on what is to be done... All while he treats her like some kind of legendary person. But in essence she has a tantrum to get her way and the man obviously folds. The admiral is played by a great actor but I feel I can see regret in is acting choice there.

Now compare that to literally every other Trek, they spend time with each character, allowing you to know them including flaws which define them. I can tell you every name from the original series to Enterprise and stuff about them. In Discovery I can name 3 and I can give you traits like he's gay, she's a mess etc and that is it.

Story is a joke, some of the laziest writing I have every seen. Each episodes plot is contrite, focusing around a thin overarching series plot with each series getting worse. They have written themselves into history, before Kirk with tech that is far more advanced. Destroyed the Klingons, they look attrocious and their culture a mess. Made a mockery of Vulcans. And in season 2 they had this dumb plot with an angel that resulted in writing themselves out of history to preserve the time line... Season 3 is set in the future but honestly it's such a dumb plot with a tantruming alien ruining traveling because plot. They cry, the tantrum, they cry and they constantly disobay orders or ignore the chain of command because they are treated like legends.

Enterprise is a prequel, enterprise was written really well as a prequel, every story had ramifications no matter how big or small and treated the existing cannon with care. Like the Borg showing up, the Klingons losing their ridges, how star fleet was formed. Even addition of new species like the Denoblians(or However it's spelled) and Xindi was handled with care and felt like apart of normal trek.

Overall I don't think any of the modern trek is worth it, Picard and the animated trash who's name I forgot. I don't like what they have done to a beloved series and I don't like how it's some bastardised version of other sci-fi shows where all the worst aspects are put into a blender. The expanse and obviously the Orville are vastly better shows that are more trek than modern Star Trek.",25 October 2021
"Liking how its really unexpected. I read some of the 1 star reviews and its funny how people put their hate into watching this show cause they want everything to stay in the same manner as the previous series. You must not like the latest Star Wars The Last Jedi movie either. Everything doesn't have to suit your expectations but if you can't appreciate a different story or method of showing it then just say you don't like it and move on.

I get the flow of this series has a lot to do with war and betrayal and I haven't read what the writers and directors plans are to take this series but it does have a good direction of showing these events in the history of Star Trek. It may not be as inspiring as the other series but if you haven't seen the news before, war is a thing on Earth so maybe from different points of views in this fictional story of actual battle fields toward peace and discovery, you can be inspired to make better choices!",30 January 2018
I always like Star Trek Discover and gave it a 7 or 8 but now 2 episodes into season 3 its a 10(10).,23 October 2020
"It's a change from past treks. Its darker grittier feel than past Treks and has found inspiration in the Expanse and Battlestar Galactica. I understand the disappointment of diehard Trekkies. I know that feeling of being betrayed by your favorite show or artist, but I also understand the need for growth. I appreciate different visions that come with new directors, reboots and so on. If you are a Trekkie who can go into the show with an open mind I think you will have yourself an enjoyable time watching it. If you are looking for fundamental Trek you may be disappointed. I binged the first season in one sitting.",20 February 2019
"One of the appeals of old sci fi is that it portrayed a future where space travel and alien races were simply part of life. Sci fi of the past decade or so uses strange lighting (why don't ships of the future have enough lights on the decks?), weird camera angles, overly bold colors, and distorted prismatic lens effects. Discovery is another step into this disturbing trend. This is true everywhere, but especially in the Klingon scenes. It needs less comic book gimics and more thoughtful staging.

There is also a great deal of violence and thumping soundtracks. Yes, old sci fi has fighting but the story came first and exploring space is more of an adventure and scientific endeavor than making sure every episode has a few action scenes. I have to concentrate intensely to track the storyline because everything else is overdone and gets in the way.

Season 1 was a chore to watch. Season 2 has more engaging storylines. I'm hoping that this trend continues because sci fi is supposed to reveal human truths more than the latest CGI explosions.",1 June 2020
"Actually its way better than the Chris Pine Startrek movies too, and of course Enterprise. The plot is cutting edge dark, as the Feds just started their war with the Klingons. And so far the episodes are well written, and acted. The galaxy has depth, unlike the Chris pine movies where the Galaxy is about the size of a small solar system, in Discovery's universe the Galaxy is a large and dark abyss as it should be. The improved look is a good thing. Its OK to improve the look of the known Alien races. Star Trek:TMP did it first with the new Klingons back in 1979. So its time to vamp up the appearance as make-up technologies improve. Besides, no Alien race should look too human to be believable. I only wish they made the Vulcans look more Alien because they still look like Chinese people who got their ears caught in a rice-picker (remember that line in city on the edge of tomorrow?)

The potential problem this series could have are anachronistic. Since the past history of star-trek has been chronicled in every detail. Discovery is cutting it a little too close with deviations. Inter ship lock-ons and transports were tricky in the original star-trek, you know materializing in bulk heads and all that. But discovery does it like they are in Picard's era and not 10 years prior to Kirk. They never use a transporter room, ugh don't do that anymore! Aliens: don't invent new Aliens! That killed ST Enterprise. At that Epoc there were only the 20 or so....Gorn, Andorean, Orion pirates, Klingon, Vulcan, Romulan, tellarites, tholian etc. Actually some of those were not known in Discovery's day. The galaxy is not that crowded Alpha quadrant yet. But they might get back on track if the writers of Discovery get put in place and stick to the technologies and races that are only allowed in that epoch. here's hoping. I enjoy the series, looking to see where it takes me next.

Edit: So I watched it to season's end, and it is way off the mark as far as Star Trek Lore goes. I can accept that because i really enjoyed the story and looking forward to next season. The only disappointment was that they wrapped up the losing federation/klingon war story saga too fast. I thought it was going to be in the next season, the federation on its last legs getting pummeled by the Klingons. But nope, wrapped it up in one episode, Plot over. next!",9 November 2017
"As an old Trekkie I've seen the good the bad and the ugly ;) I started this series knowing nothing about it. Within 10 minutes I was hooked, and binged the entire series! It is absolutely stunning! From the screenplay to Directing, the new costumes, hair and make up, sets, CGI...the depth of each character is wonderful, they are all unlikely and very believable and you feel connected to them all. The actors are all absolutely wonderful, and their performances are outstanding. I really take my hat off to everyone who had a hand in creating this new Star Trek. And good luck next movie trying to top this! Thanks for giving us some great entertainment.",1 October 2020
"I'm all for equal representation, but by season 3, this show has become a ""feelings fest"" with weak story and just a cursory glossing over the action. Such a missed opportunity. I'm all for strong female characters, but this show makes it seem like men are 1/3 of the population or less. This is an alternate universe where only women can be in charge. I truly do not get why this has a 7.3 rating currently...it is not deserved anymore.",2 December 2021
"This is one of the best star trek Series Ever So much different stories and the technology just gets better and better in so many ways it's to long to explain

The key Actors are Just brilliant at what they do and I can't wait for more season's to come And I'm sure it will be a huge mystery

We need to se at least 10 seasons and more

None of this short season Stuff and ending a show just as it gets Great

The best change in the Technologies,,,,, is the best part and all the Species and Language's they speak

And the new Ships and future Star ships and people that will Have to face

I hope it will do a lot of seasons cos these days people love The stars and all the what if's

Bring on many more different and weird seasons so we can Enjoy

We love all the character's as each season has just gotten so much better that the last Can't wait for the next 5 to 10 Season's if Possible

The way the ship changes shape is so cool and new that It's a huge turn on

Even the instant Transport all over the ship And the heads up Display is Excellent as.",3 December 2022
"This may be a different take in the same universe, this is difficult for those who are used to things staying the same. It can feel to them ascnon genuine or like mixing marvel and dc characters in a single movie or series. This however is seperate from the quality of this show. It is like all other star treks, except a couple, and is ahead of its time. Everything is top notch, acting, writing, special effects, editing, directing, cinematography....etc etc. Try to leave pre conceived notions at home and this will be a hell of a treat.",29 October 2020
"This is just another pointless woke signalling drama series they just stuck a Star Trek badge on, made up mostly of people whispering to each other and crying on each others shoulders to the point even the ship starts whining to the crew...

Considering the series constantly want to show how woke it is, the characters are little more than boring and generally narrow minded stereotypes with nothing forward thinking or remotely risky in their portrayal.

Star Trek wise it just rides rough shod over Star Trek history adding in technology that didn't exist at that point and shoe horning in 'important' people into history while constantly name checking classic Star Trek history to remind you that you are meant to be watching Star Trek. With it being unintentionally ironic that a series that has no place in the Star Trek franchise and is doomed to be forgotten has a premise where all trace of the events and it's characters are written out of history.

Hopefully with the release of Strange New Worlds which is actually Star Trek, they will chuck this series along with the atrocity that only serves to sully the great name Picard in the bin and focus on Strange New Worlds instead.",14 September 2022
This series is by far the best one ever! It describes pre-Kirk well. As well as the issues of the early Federation. Great spins and great action sequences. 4 seasons so far. Let's hope for more.,20 November 2021
"Love it. This is what Star Trek is about - change it up, try new things, give the audience something new. This series doesn't follow a ship, it follows the main character. Everything she does has consequences, like all of us. The 'bad guys' just don't want to be assimilated and their culture subsumed by what they see as invaders - what could be more topical? The first episode might be a little clunky but with what they're trying to accomplish, I'll give them that one. This is not your mother's sci-fi - but I'll put latinum on the fact that Lucille Ball would have fought for its place on any network. I'm just lucky I get it on Netflix - with the option of klingon subtitles!",17 October 2017

"To start off, Star Trek is a Space Opera, not an action movie; some episodes were action packed and had continuity (between episodes) but not as long as I watched so far and certainly not more than 2 from the start. The traditional Star Trek Space Opera format is to have 2 stories at the same time, usually 1 more emotional involving the starfleet crew and 1 more stimulating, whether action or a conflict (including interpersonal) or fun (ie: holodeck entertainment), sometimes involving starfleet sometimes not (ie: Klingons episodes (Worf is there but I don't see him as an ambassador for the federation)). This is a--serious--departure from the other Star Trek series, even ones which I didn't like that much to start off with.

This series has very nice visuals, especially the protagonists at the beginning of this series, but that doesn't make up from the difference which I brought forth (in the previous paragraph) and I'm assuming it would be significantly less impressive in subsequent series viewing. The beginning of this series would be a nice action (mini-)serie (the mini if it changes later on) but I'm not looking for that, I'm looking for a Space Opera, the wagon train to the stars, not an 8-horse war wagon to the stars.",30 October 2017
"Each episode feels like a continuing full-length motion picture. The production value is high, and acting is excellent.. BUT production companies/networks taking YEARS between seasons is ridiculous. I watched the first two seasons of Game of Thrones, then finally decided I'd wait until the series was over to watch the whole thing. Plus, the way things go anymore, you might want to do this simply so a company doesn't simply ""pull the plug"" and leave you hanging as a viewer. No wrap.. no end. Just over. I really like Discovery, but my just wait until Paramount wraps the series up completely before I continue watching it. The way the production is going, we could wind-up being in season 9 and all the actors in their 60's! (I feel bad for the actors. This can't be a great way for actors to be cast. Not sure WHAT some of them do between seasons.)",31 December 2023
"I'll start by saying that anyone who thinks there are not enough white people on the set, or a problem with all shapes and sizes of beings, or a problem with different orientations and sexualities being represented on screen, needs to go back to their cave and contemplate their miserable lives. You don't deserve to share our oxygen.

With regards to the actual show, i very much enjoyed the 1st 3 seasons. The originality was surprising but more than welcome in a series with source material that's already been beaten to death with reruns. The casting director has done a fantastic job finding actors capable of a wider array of emotions than are normally seen in a TV show, and the writers have brilliantly given the actors all they could handle.

Having said that...season 4 is a big disappointment so far. I couldn't stand Deep Space 9 because it was nothing but talk, psycho babble, personal relationships and boring drama. I'm sure the budgeting director for this season is ecstatic, because 25 minutes of 1 on 1 scenes talking about emotions don't cost much, however I'm falling asleep. Haven't watched the whole season yet, so I'm hoping it picks up again.",6 February 2022
"When there's a significant disparity between critic's reviews and audience reviews like there are with this show, especially for a sci fi series or movie, it's almost always because incels have a problem with a female lead or didn't understand something or are just generally morons and have decided to hijack the reviews so producers will change future installments like they mistakenly did with The Rise of Skywalker. This is a great series. Ignore the incels. They're idiots.",1 February 2020
"I've now seen the first four episodes of Stark Trek Discovery, and it is a brilliant piece of work. It would have gotten at least an 8, maybe 9 out of 10 if it wasn't for the fact that it was called Star Trek. It just doesn't have the liberal core that would make it a proper Star Trek, but then again maybe it does - Michael shows promise.

The show that I saw looks to have had its roots in Star Wars (a space war), Alien/Jaws (no spoilers but kind of obvious), and Lord Of the rings (The Klingons do look and sound like the Orcs from Jackson's film). There are also a whole lot of other things that link to other films. So not entirely original, but its all been wonderfully put together to make a classic.

Will I be watching episode 5 - yes!",13 October 2017
"To all my fellow trekkies and sci fi lovers...i'm sorry. I'm sorry this series even exists. It's horrible. The writing, the Mary Sue Michael Burnham, the obvious social justice box checking, and the overall feminization of men is sickening.

I'm sure the blue checkmarks on twitter, the .00001% of americans that can't figure out what bathroom to use and the kids with two dads love this series. For the rest of us not so much.

Forget this series even exists, if you paid a subscription to watch this cancel it. Maybe when networks start losing money they will start asking the right questions and stop with this low brow social engineering drivel.

Go watch The Expanse, reruns of Babylon 5...watch paint dry, all of these would be better than suffering through this series.",5 November 2021
"Just finished watched season 2 which was absolutely fantastic. So , so , so much better than season 1 . The last episode had feature film quality , suspense, action , twists, and lump in the throat moments. Absolutely can't wait for Season 3 to see what adventures happen next for Discovery. Plus they've got a fantastic opportunity to follow the continuing adventures of the Enterprise ... Great stuff.",8 March 2020
This show is by far one of the best in the star trek series. It's refreshing. A new take and extremely well done. People just like to hate I guess. That's silly. I enjoy it. I hope they continue to do more.,17 February 2020
"This review is based on the first two episodes: It's clear that Disney Star Wars is affecting this show. Might be for JJ? Who cares, at least is different from the original show, more on the line with the recent movies. Colors, design in general, costumes are interesting, a bit less the space skirmishes; overall a good product. Not for real star trek fans, maybe useful to grab new fans from SW audience. Nothing truly original, but at least with some passion in it.

It's a Sci-Fi deep space adventure with logic, plans, action and emotions. A thriller sci-fi?",28 September 2017
"When leftism destroys franchises, with obvious racial and sex quotas - just looks at the series 'Dark Matter'. The trend of female-led super vanity women being the Macgyvers of space. Just don and use male- created technology, and a woman can do the same as a man. The writers don't care for the long following fans (who they think as a blob of white males), and are after the minorities and women viewers. Look for more dialogue in the series pertaining to 'race and culture are not the same', etc. The Klingons also look more African in language tone, costume patterns and face appearance. I do find amusing the indispensability of women - who are also the lead troublemakers in most TV-movies - quite eye roll worthy.",25 September 2017

"Remember the episode where Reginald Barclay tries to save Voyager and has to stand up to his superiors. The first two seasons seem like a Reginald Barkley who keeps wanting to use his genius, but is interrupted by some idiot superiors. And then in season 3, unfortunately, he is arrested and replaced by an outdated artificial intelligence that has only been trained with gender theories and third-rate gay musicals. CBS should stop the experiment with OpenAI GPT-3!

"Take it for what it is. A great looking science fiction show, which takes a familiar brand and puts a different spin on it. It's full of thrills, action, laughs, and above all, it doesn't take itself too serious, which sadly cannot be said about a lot of the fanboys. Sit back, relax, put everything you thought you knew about Star Trek to one side, and enjoy. It's fiction after all, no need to get butthurt.",17 February 2019
"An absolutely wonderful reboot, laying out the imagined future history of the universe after ""Enterprise"", and before the NCC-1701 Enterprise kids born in the 1960s first saw, with Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and Scotty! While it is much grittier than previous franchise members, playing during the Federation vs. Klingon War, the series is still back to Roddenberry optimism in a roundabout way, as it plays on themes of hope and redemption against all odds. Discovery also lost the technobabble that was so intrusive after the original series, which I think is one more major reason, why the following series have a hard time to this day compared to ""TOS"". The Berman series also very often suffered badly from a soap opera feel, that took me quite some time getting used to. Discovery is back to full drama without any ""soapy"" feel, and yet does great character development, which is a difficult balance to strike. Altogether, a truly stellar comeback of a phenomenon I thought had died a long and quiet death. Star Trek is alive! I only wish they wouldn't hide it on CBS' subscription streaming channel, instead broadcasting on regular TV.",23 November 2019
I love the show and in season 2 the characters are so likable.The haters should stop because Gene Rodenberry didn't like extremists that's for sure.,18 February 2019
"Pretty intriguing plot lines, that are well connected and keep you guessing what will happen. When the scripts deal with interpersonal relationships, however, it's pretty awkward ie forced. The Klingon love was the only believable connection.

I could do without all the whispering and the crying - who talks like that? Ninety percent of the dialogue, especially between a certain mom and sister, is in whisper with hugs every other take. Tf are you whispering for??

There is one character that reminds me of Jar Jar Binks cuz she never shuts up, and is clearly there for comic relief. She's actually not so bad. But maybe that's because of lack of screen time.

All the captains are pretty lame. There isn't a single captain I'm like, ""Yea, what a powerful leader!"" I get Michael is supposed to be the star of the show, but come on. Discovery formula: a. Something bad happens. b. Captain makes decision c. Michael says no. d. Captain says okay, you right.

I almost got turned off completely to the show at that one part where Michael convinces a certain character not to annihilate a certain thing. And even though that certain character had ALL the bargaining power, was untouchable, had no reason to relent, and had achieved checkmate, that character was still like, ""Okay, you win Michael! Darn, I give up."" Like how???

Captain Pike is way too weak for my taste, How did he ever become a captain? He doesn't make any decisions, his crew does. He constantly needs saving. ALL THE TIME. Pike's Number One angers me with her disrespect. Who talks to their Captain in such a snarky, casual way, like she couldn't care less who he is? Captain Pike's Number One acts like his superior, and all of that kinda shut me down to the show all together.

If I want to see crying, I'll watch the Flash, and if I want I want to see weak characters without conviction I'll watch Star Wars.",6 March 2020
"So I watched 2 episodes, and so far, it's OK. Good enough to keep at it.

Obvious first downside for me? It took less than 3 minutes of episode one to shove feminism, empowered minority women, and trans-gendered innuendo at us full bore. It is also extremely focused on feelings, and goes into great length, each and every little thought and feeling every character has, at every damn moment.

At least that's how it seemed.

Long drawn out dramatic sequences, and probably a third of the run time wasted by drowning us in drama.

What the hell kind of Klingons are those?? It's barely Star Trek. Barely. I don't know where they are going with this, but I sure hope it gets less dramatic, and more Star Trek-ish.

And now for the good parts. The parts are acted well, despite the melodrama in every scene. It is written well, and the story is good enough to keep you interested....again, despite the overabundance of drama.

I will keep watching, and hopefully it gets better.",27 September 2017
"So far loving it, totally hooked, and hanging for the next episode. Season 2 has convinced me that this is still very much the Trek I know and love. I'm 48 and have watched every episode of Star Trek ever made many times over. I'm delighted they have brought the franchise back to the small screen and really looking forward to seeing the return of Picard. Don't understand all the negative reviews. All the old Trek is still awesome, but very dated. If they rerun all the old Kirk episodes on prime time, I really don't think it would gain much traction. My daughter is really loving Discovery which I'm thrilled about, so I guess they are successfully entertaining the Next Generation, as well as some of the old Trekkies like me... I just don't understand what not to like about this and all the negative remarks, hands down it's the best sci fi that's out for me in a very long time.",15 February 2019
Not as horrid as some make it out to be. I'm an old school Trekker I grew up watching TOS in the 70s. This could be worse as in NO Trek at all on TV as it. has been for 12 1/2 years. I watched every Star Trek series when it was originally aired except TOS little young for that. I think the Movies they made recently are much more of a horror show than this series is. Yes the Klingon makeup is a bit overkill and the scripts need polishing but it beats rehashing TOS on the big screen with Red Matter ...barf. Complaints about tech are silly back in the 1960s 80s etc they could only do so much . We live in an era of Micro Tech now should we pretend we don't when making this series? Better to pretend TOS or TNG looked better than it did at the time. Discovery while not great does offer a door into the Star Trek Universe again and maybe with some input from the fans it can be great.,6 February 2018
Seasons 1 and 2 showed promise. Season 3 began sliding into internal emotional battles as well as the ridiculous premise that a 900+ year old ship and crew is now the Federation's sole salvation. That's like saying a ship from the 12th Century would save the US Navy if today. Season 4 had quickly become one huge hug and cry fest. There's at most five minutes per episode of action and 40+ minutes of self reflectionism.,18 January 2022
"Amazing! I really enjoyed this. Although, I'm a optimist. I went into this wanting to like it. The only thing I could possibly be miffed with is some of the dialogue felt rushed. I could care less about the ""purists"" contention. It's definitely ""new"" and ""updated"" and the purists won't like technical or continuity changes. Here's the best part about being upset. You can always cross your arms in defiance and go watch the old ones. The rest of us will continue to enjoy the time money someone else has finally put into Star Trek!! Or you can raise some money and go make your own old school ""tribute"" style Star Trek show ;-) In the end I think the majority of people want ""new"", not more of the ""Same Old, Same Old"". I for one will subscribe and continue to watch!!!",25 September 2017
"If you have seen every Star Trek series, and you have a standard you got used to, i tell you a secret: you can lower the bar and enjoy this one or you can put it high and dont. It reminds me to the Suicide Squad, because it was a light, fun, action, comicbook comedy, but because it came out after the whole Superman Batman thing and the Batman trilogy, erveryone thought it must be a serious die hard movie and they held it to a very high standard. Dont make the same mistake. Yes, it is different, yes it has a lot of things in it what you will recognize as today's social justice warrior leftist agendas, but which star trek was not having references of their day and age? I am at the end of the 3rd season and i have to tell you i really started to like the crew. Picard on the other hand left me with little joy, but it is a different story for another day :D",31 January 2021
"This started as a great Star Trek show. New characters, interesting plot etc. Really LOVED it for the first and maybe second season.

Then it hit a wall. Terrible plot, cheesy character development and awfull acting. Tje lead has ONE face expression, tormented, hurt, questioning face. Whatever she says is said in the same, one-dimensional, half whispering tone.

The only development the other characters have is their sexual/gender orientation.

The overall season plot could be shown in 2-3 episodes, not 13.

I've gone from loving her and the show to fast forwaring 50-60% of every episode.

This is not Star Trek, this is Days of our hipster-all-inclusive Lives in space.

"I have absolutely love Star Trek Discover. I went back to the first season and realised the Klingon aspect was actually quite boring. When they weren't on screen i enjoyed everything else.

"It is time to say why I like Star Trek: Discovery. Like any Star Trek series that came before it, it took some time to get used to. At first, I was leery of the more serial format, but I read the novels, so I kept an open mind going into this. I am OK with the choice of the lead character, since it was the main plot. Unfortunately, the alternating captains overshadowed the background bridge crew, rendering them almost invisible. The uniqueness of Discovery's spore drive cemented its place in the 23rd century. The return to the Terran universe was totally unexpected for me. The state of the Federatiion revealed in Season 3, have never been seen in any of the series. The arrival to the 32nd century also brought to light to some more of Discovery's crew. Finally, halfway through season 3, the stories being told felt like a return to the type of stories that better reflect present day situations. I am finally hooked.",12 January 2021
"Skip season 1 if you care about existing canon, or pretend it is in a spinoff universe like the JJ films. Season 2 is okay, less canon breaking, still a bit too much star wars not enough star trek.

"This show is an absolute dumpster fire. While the first two seasons were full of bad writing, terrible acting, and idiotic plot lines, they were somewhat watchable. Season 3 & 4 , on the other hand, have been made up of one utterly disastrous episode after another. Culminating in a season finale that is nothing but a political endorsement of one Stacey Abrams. From the non-stop woke ideology, to every character crying in EVERY episode....this is an abomination made for the people that have purple hair, pronouns in their profiles and get offended by pancake syrup.",18 March 2022

"This reminds me a little of Voyager in that its first episode is a little clumsy, but I'm happy to report that the cast and crew of Discovery grew into their roles quickly. This is definitely not my least favorite Trek series, but not favorite either.

Star Trek was always a bit cheesy and I think Disco has maintained that element. That's probably not easy in this series because it's a little more graphic and realistic than the others - this is probably not a Trek series meant for kids under about 12, some might argue for even older. So, Its target audience is a little older than even the Ent audience was; it's more graphic than Ent. However, if you're looking for super heavy full-grown adult stories, you probably won't find them in star Trek. There is still an appeal to some kids which continues to be true, just as it was true for everything Star Trek from the beginning. Also, don't listen to Star Wars fanboys who come here and talk about ""canon,"" because Star Trek hasn't cared about canon for like 30 years, it's a concept that is not a thing with Star Trek and actually it isn't really a thing for Star Wars any more either.

Lastly, it is also great to see that Star Trek is still an American TV leader for inclusion and diversity.",1 October 2021
"This isn't about the ship, it's about a volatile child whose personality changes so drastically its absurd. It's episodes are riddled with endless, boring speeches. None are rousing or even well writen. Especially the 3rd and 4th season, the emphasis on the weakest character ruins the show.",2 December 2021
I just finishe watching both season. I'd give the first season a 6 or 7 it started with. The Klingons that looked alot different that all previous permutations The spore drive was a little hard to believe. The Terran Empire was interesting. The finish of the war with the Klingons was ok but a little to easy. I liked Gorgieo the remainder of Season 2 was very good I give it an 8+.,12 February 2020
My thanks for continuing the star trek usage of diversity. Not many have strong females leads and its long overdue. Enjoy some of the plot and costume design is phenomenal....especially the gold leather on the alter universe. Have been a trekkie since the 60s.,22 November 2018
"I was all but ready to write this show off, especially after reading some the negative reviews, but as I've watched each episode I have grown to like it. My initial rating of 6.5 for the first episode has been boosted to an overall 9 for the series this far.

So why the upgrade? Well, even though the first episode is a disappointment for a lifelong admirer of Star Trek I determined to give it a chance, to see just how bad it could get. To my utter surprise, the show develops excellently. From Episode 3 the focus shifts to Captain Lorca, who is definitely not the typical Star Fleet skipper. A soldier at heart, he is a man who wants to get things done and doesn't care, one jot, for anyone else, including his Star Fleet superiors. The other Star Fleet characters eventually develop a familiar nature and the only group who tend to be a problem are the Klingons. Indeed, the additional villains seem to echo regular Start Trek fayre. The Harry Mudd episode was familiar territory and worked particularly well.

If I'm being harsh I'd say they are a totally new race and the writers portray them as far too ""Klingony""; aggressive, unsubtle, nutters. We know there is far more to them than the one dimensional stereotype we see here. They'd be better if they were a little less alien, especially in their language. There is no need for them to speak in Klingon when they are the only ones listening. Their scenes are a bit over the top and drag on a little too much. That said, they do get better as the shows progress but many old viewers will be disappointed. I didn't use them as an excuse to mark the show down as taken as a new race they are perfectly fine as potential enemies.

Finally, the show is not for kids. I was 8 or 9 when I watched the first series back in the 70's and there was never any complaint from my parents. This show has a liberal smattering of expletives and suggestive sexual scenes that many parents will not want under 13's watching. It does make it a more grown up affair which isn't a bad thing in my view.

I'd recommend treating Episodes 1 & 2 as background to plough through, rather than episodes to make you hungry for more. The production and SFX are great throughout so even the early duffers are watchable, if not inspiring. If you think of the show as slightly askew of the Star Trek canon, with references to The Original Series that are no longer relevant (such as the Communicator), but overall an enjoyable Sci-Fi outing, you won't be disappointed.",7 November 2017
This is the Star Trek I always envisioned as I watched the different interpretations since the early 70's. No camp in this version and just the right amount of dirt. Closer to Aliens than anything ever before. Darker and much tighter plots. I guess what I like the most is the detail. Klingons finally look and act as evil as I always wanted. It's almost creepy!!! I hope movies are born of Discovery.,10 February 2018
"I was pretty wary in the first season. The klingons were a bit overkill, in my opinion. There were some good episodes that reminded me of the old star trek, but it wasn't until season 2 that they really hit gold. They introduced spock and captain pike, which saved the show. They were able to seamlessly weave the new narrative into the original series. I can't really explain how without ruining it, but it was a really fun ride.",4 April 2020
"I stayed and enjoyed the new look to Star Trek, however as the show developed i failed to be inspired and started to be annoyed - i like the good action and suspense when balanced with the story and depth - and here we kind of drift apart ... i am looking forward to see more, but without any expectation to be sucked in the story nor be amazed by the drama ...",14 January 2021
"If you enjoy shows that are melodramatic, the main character is the only one that matters, and she cries every other scene- you'll love it.

Honestly, I feel sorry for the main actress. She must be terribly dehydrated from all that crying. Seriously, I challenge you to find a single episode where there isn't crying.

I think I lack the vocabulary to put into words how bad this show is. It's like trying to describe color to a blind person. You just have to experience it to understand.",18 November 2021
"This and the expanse are the two best sci fi shows on tv. Period. Trekkies can't get over the show being focused on a story arc rather than mini self contained episodes with a loose focus on a story arc in the background. Get with the times! Hard sci fi, great visually, Micheal Burbank is awesome, new Spock is brilliant and better than the one in the recent films. Can't wait for season three. Season 1 was a slow burner but 2nd half was mind blowing moly good. Season 2 had everything - literally everything - only reason this gets a 9 is because of the first half of season 1..... but don't get me wrong, it was still good! Personally this is the best Star Trek series ever, and I've seen them all.",7 October 2019
"I've been a fan of Star Trek since I was a kid, watching and growing up on Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and of course all of the films. Enterprise is amazing with showing how everything develops in the tech.

Discovery is a fantastic reinterpretation of the history prior to Kirk era, and then leading in to the future past the time wars, showing another conflict with ""the burn.""

I get how some fans don't favor the social diversity sort being crammed in several episodes, more females in charge than males and gay or nongender characters. I really don't care about that. Those elements don't take away from a fun and original story line and I hope to see more.

Looking forward to starting the Picard series and then Captain Pike Enterprise series soon to come out.

You're either a Trek fan or not. Some films are better than others as well as shows, but together, they all work and I love it!",18 March 2022
"Completely immoral, unethical sociopathic characters. And I'm not talking about the Klingons. Nothing likable about this version. Made it to E4. Won't be watching anymore.",10 April 2022
In episode 24 of season 3 of TOS a very important character named Janice Lester was introduced. Her plot was to become Captain of the Enterprise by becoming James T Kirk trading places with him in fact. It was a reflection of social values of the time indicating how females felt at being cut out of command positions. What Discovery may want to play with is allowing Janice Lester to somehow make it to Discovery's future to challenge the new FEMALE LEADERSHIP OF THE FUTURE! SHE AND HER MESSAGE WOULD BE A WORTHY ADVERSARY FOR MICHAEL B. MAYBE SHE'S ALREADY THERE! ;),5 December 2021
"Thank God it's not the old Star Trek.

The characters aren't politically correct childish idiots invented by a skinny fat dude who never had a gram of stress in his life. It's not a ""safe"" show that's going to tell you everything is going to be fine. In fact everything is darker and serious. I hated the old Star Trek because everything about it was childish. Finally they made it the way it was always supposed to be.

Don't bother reading the negative comments. The people who write them are probably triggered by a fart and cry when they see a leaf being torn from a branch by the wind.",9 October 2017
"CGI and character special effects are the best on television today... I dropped my rating after engaging mid-way through S3. It's no longer the Star Trek: Discovery but now the Michael Burnham show. She is a good actress probably doing the best she can with script gaps where you fill in with emotions, I-can-do-it-all, romance and lots of weeping (very un-Vulcan) in between. I signed up to CBS All Access just for this show and S2 - Anson Mount (Hell On Wheels). There is some supporting cast development and needs to be more, with more appearances of those that actual do the work on any ship, if only to take a bullet/lazer blast (Remember the red shirts on original?). I agree with previous review that show writing and creation needs to go back to more new exploring and continue with variable character engagements per episode in SciFi tradition to be it's best. My viewing in S3 has devolved into fast-forwarding through the ""soap opera"" melodramatics to get through to whatever plot/new challenge is ongoing.",24 December 2020
"The first two episodes of Star Trek Discovey did not disappoint. The storyline brought us back into a time in Star Trek lore that had yet to be explored. As with any new show, I expect it will take a few episodes for the characters to develop their complexities, quirks, and relationships between one another. What I've seen so far, though, holds great promise. Production quality and music were worthy of the big screen. Without spoiling anything, I have to say the pilot episodes set the stage well for the rest of the series. Gene Roddenberry would be proud.

The only thing wrong with Star Trek Discovery is that CBS chose to limit the availability of this great show to those with the budget and ability to watch via broadband stream. For that, Mr. Roddenberry would be sadly disappointed. I would strongly encourage them to reconsider the limited availability of this show. They should at least make it available on demand (for cable/satellite viewers), at no extra charge, a few weeks after the original broadcast date, then over the air a little later in the season. Star Trek should be enjoyed by all who love it - not just those who can afford it.",24 September 2017
"It's a great show, if you're willing to ignore a countless number of flaws, specially when it comes to script, storytelling...because the CGI and photography and production are actually quite good.

The writers can tell an engaging story, but they totally ignore logic, the story bends reality more often than not...like, at one moment someone is suffering with PTSD, then at the words of a superior officer it immediately disappears...stuff like that...but, it's fun to watch...",2 March 2022
"Crying Wing Jesus. Tks Alex Kurtzman for destroying another legacy Sci Fi. Horrible lense flares and weird camera effects. Idiotic plots, way more fantasy than science. Disrespectful crew members 1 upping everyone else. Long story arcs that get lost from beginning to end. Worst of all its Star Trek in name only. Remove the Star Trek from name.",1 February 2022
As a Star Trek Fan I slowly got annoyed by those single episodes. Poorly any stories in the old shows. This starts fresh and completely different from what Star Trek was like. I don't understand all the bad reviews here but apparently a lot of people like to chew an old gum over and over again. This is modern scifi and I really hope it keeps going because for me it's great.,2 March 2019
"I love the Star Trek universe and the Discovery was an interesting and excellent continuance of the ""world"". Sadly the series went from a 9/10 to a 5/10 with season 3 and 4. I'm not even paying attention anymore...it went from ""sitting on the edge of the sofa"" to; It's just so booooring... snooze 💤 what happened?",15 January 2022
"The special effects are great and what gets Discovery to 4 stars, otherwise it would barely get past 1 star. Whoever decided to add loads of crying and long drawn out dramatic speeches to a Star Trek series should be fired. And if I have to watch the crew stare at each other with starry smiley eyes one more time, I think I'm going to be sick.

It's a sci-fi so stick to the science and take us on a trip through the stars, it's that easy. That's what we want to see! Have absolutely no interest in watching the crew hug, kiss, cry and embrace in glorious sparkly love every 10 seconds. Sorry, I've got it on in the background while writing this and it's driving me crazy!

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO STAR TREK!!!",10 December 2021
"Look, this is the thing... Die hard fans of the original ST won't like this, neither will those who liked the other spin offs and some of the films. This is a bit like DS9 - you love it or you hate it! DS9 was utter pointless. A waste of air, 'space' and time. It was NOT Star Trek. This on the other hand is a Voyager reboot bringing in modern tones of diversity and some realistic language and relationship updates. If you liked Voyager, you'll like this. This is the first proper series reboot in years - give it a friggin chance folks. This has some strong characters and some good signs of promise. Give it chance. Don't 'kling on' to the past and expect every ST to be the same. If you do - don't bother watching and don't bother rating it a 1 - you're not worthy. Those who did give a 1/10 - how many episodes did you watch before you decided your rating? - to the end? - yeah I bet. Given time it'll mature and improve. It's not perfect, I agree. It's early days for a new series. Who doesn't want a Star Trek reboot series to medicate themselves between the block-buster films - without the acting incapabilities of Simon Pegg 'humour' additions - which ruined the last couple!!! In summary, it's time for something to stir the loins of ST fans. What I really really don't understand is why it takes 19, yes 19! (count them) 'producers' to be credited in the opening titles.",4 February 2018
The series are great - I like the visuals - the storie arch is great - the tech amazing. There are flaws - but - hey - this is really an amazing show with a lot of great content .,26 February 2019
"It's certainly among the best Sci-Fi series of the decade. The story is engaging. The characters are realistic. They have depth and much room for development. The protagonist's emotion vs logic is a classic question of nature vs nurture. The captain of Shenzhou is a believable good boss, with her adherence to rules and willingness to take responsibility and go above and beyond the call of duty. The captain of the Discovery is not a classic good guy, but you are suppose ask how far are you willing to go to get what you want? The shy girl is the ambitious geek type I can relate to the most. I'm rooting for her because she reminds me of myself. The Klingons are not portrayed as bad guys either. The themes of political manipulation, religious fanaticism and using war for unity and popularity, these are interesting. Just as we can look back today at the optimism in science in the 1970s in TOS, I'm sure many will look back on Discovery as a reflection of our time.

I'm very surprised by the number of 1 star reviews on here. I genuinely wonder if these are real people or Russian bots. Because all of them are repeating the same few phrases with slightly different wording. If you hate a show so much then surely you have some original things to say about it, right? If the best you can do is repeat ""cast is bad, acting is bad, camera-work is bad, too much special effects, story is bad, my favorite director wasn't involved, it's dull/boring, then nitpick about some Star Trek continuity errors... ..."" That's not a review, that's the kind of speech bot I ask my first year students to write as an assignment.

There are a few things I disliked about the show. There is no science in this show so far (ep1-3). I think they would do better to get an actual physicist and an actual biologist and give them actual influence on the script writing. Because so far this show is pure magic and zero science. I know Star Trek is very soft SciFi, but still I think it needs to be a little more grounded in science than this, otherwise it will turn into a magic fantasy. Also, this show didn't need the $8m/ep budget, they could have spent a lot less and showed it on cable/sky instead of locking it behind the CBS all access paywall in US and the Netflix paywall here in UK.

Overall Discovery is very good. Its faults are easy to look past, and I find it rather enjoyable to watch. So 8/10.",6 October 2017
Amazing storyline! Love the new Klingon look. The characters are well-developed and interesting. Completely blows the original series out of the water. New ideas new look I hope they keep it going for years to come.,29 December 2018
"Like most of the other reviewers, I'm a long time Star Trek fan who loved every iteration of the series. Some more than others (Voyager was my favorite). I hated the STD pilot but by Episode 3 it's starting to grow on me. As with Voyager, major changes are occurring within the first few episodes. I'm glad now I kept watching. Sure, I have to get used to the different appearance of the Klingons (and James Frain's shockingly, horribly awful portrayal of Sarek on so many levels). But I've managed to get past that and am trying to give it a chance. I actually found myself starting to like it halfway through Episode 2. I might just stick with it.",2 October 2017

"Trolling and Comparing, finding something to hate is detectable in comments about all kind of politicians around the world right now, about all religions, about all minorities, about the left-wing and right-wing, about all the rich and about all the poor, about actors and songs and movies, about TV shows and all kind of entertainment.

So why not just comparing and hating the new Star Trek series? Comparing the actors and the style and the age and some see political motives, others think of far too much female influence.

So easy to do. Mental retarded people are able to compare and hate everything who is different to them. More advanced. Too complicated build up so they cannot grasp the idea yet. It's so much more easy to criticize, when we not understand the next level of a more advanced story.

There is too much and too little of everything... I think then it is perfect!

This series needs IMO some more brain activity then usual and a bit more imagination. To me it is a much more sophisticated version of Star Trek and definitely a Game-changer in design, with whole new technical ideas we perhaps can see on marked in the future - (like iPhone and iPad was).

I see a whole new kind of Science Fiction is showing up. The whole genre is shifting gear now. Very exiting to watch this change. This show is exceeding my expectations - like MadMax or the 5th element or Avatar did. Lots and lots of work, brain activity and courage behind building up such a Game Changer. I hope people will understand more and more of the intention behind. The series clearly stated: Not the bureaucrats should rule the world, but the people with courage, with a great heart and a big sword and the ability to see the whole picture, not just a tiny part of it. Great show!",23 October 2017
"I really enjoy most Trek shows, but Disco needs help. The show is predictable, to the point that it leaves little room for suspense or the thrill of witnessing plot twists. The sci-fi action is good, the sets are spectacular, as Is the cgi, but the writing needs a real tweak. It really lacks that Star Trek energy. Hopefully season 3 is an improvement.",5 December 2019
Great new take on Star Trek. But the best part of the show is it has hands-down the best special effects on television right now. As far as TV shows go the expanse is a distant second in that department,15 August 2018
This is very much made for a wider audience. More action. More drama. More enjoyment. Overall a good sci-fi show. Some trekies may not like it. It's different to the other star trek shows.,12 March 2019
"I hoped that the hiatus meant a massive revamp of this show: alas it was not to be.

"Ah, forget about all the negative blasphemy-tending reviews of not-so-Trekkie-after-all watchers, it is TOTALLY Star Trek and perhaps I liked it in a different way as I liked Next Generation, Voyager or Enterprise and the mini show Picard, these came also in other times of my life - which most likely affected the viewing experience. But it still SURE IS 100% Star Trek and totally felt like it when I watched. Cast was absolutely superb! And with an amazing seasons finale, and most likely, series finale, Discovery is one not to be missed. Here you go with my 10 out of 10 for all the good work and great adventures in space and time!",12 January 2021
"As many other have stated...""Star Trek: Discovery"" is really soo much not the Star Trek we all love and cherish and it feels like somebody is giving you tar saying it is a chocolate. Because it is not!! Apart from name, settings of the narrative and some motives, there is no other connections with the Star Trek. I understand that there was an idea to try a different approach...maybe. To experiment with the franchise. To try something new. But they should have know better not to mess with funboys and Trekkies who are wrapped around in the cocoon of ""original is the best"" and ""don't you dare touch in the sacred dogmas of holly Star Trek"" So from that perspective...they have failed.

BUT!!!

If we ignore for a second that this is Star Trek and view it as a stand alone SF show.. ..it is a not bad show!!! Not bad at all! Sure, there are some hicckups in the story and it is far from perfect, but over all it is well done! I mean, I have seen faaar worse SF (movies or shows) lately so I personally enjoyed it and I have to say, the further the season goes, the better the show gets.

So....it is not Star Trek....but it is the enjoyable SF!!!",6 February 2018
"For some of those people, who rant that the new series has destroyed a franchise, how can one new show kill all that has gone before? I've been a Trek fan from the very beginning, read all the books , but I am being told by people who who weren't even born when Trek started that I can't be a true Trek fan if I like Discovery! Kirk and Spock will always be my favourite but I am happy to see new ideas , even if it differs from what I know and love. It's tv not religion. I remember being told by Trek fans when next generation came out that that show sucked and should never have been made, looked how that turned out. I am no expert but all I can say is that this is well made and entertaining. Will it give Star Trek a bad name ? Of course not! A lot of reviews has cast this aside and most say they stopped watching after one episode, wow they must be real experts on entertainment if they can base a score on a series after only one episode. City on the edge of forever is my all time favourite Star Trek episode, I've seen it hundreds of times , but occasionally I don't mind seeing something different!",31 May 2018

"I have been watching star trek since its inception when I was a child. This version is a rollicking space opera. I have enjoyed both seasons and have waited with bated breath for each episode. Like all episodes and versions and iterations of this space opera this reinvention is not a slow burn. I am not too sure if it will be back for a season three, it might in a variation of voyager only this time in the beta quadrant but only time will tell. Even though I am a child of Star Trek I do not and never have allowed myself to create a rigidity or dogma around it. It is the purest of escape fantasies for me and as such I align my imagination with each episode and I enjoy the thrill ride that it creates for me. Just allow yourself to drift.",19 April 2019
"They sure know how to recycle actors! I know it's sci-fi but some of the story in season 2 feels like a long version of ""The Search for Spock"" which was a real snooze.",11 November 2020
This is one of the most action packed star treks I've ever watched. The pace is good and not slow. The characters are relatable and well developed. I think one of my favorite parts of the show is how you get to see the crew of the discovery become a family.,15 August 2018
"I actually am loving this show. I love the diversity as was Gene Roddenberry's original vision. I have to say though it's too much Burnham. This was where the Original failed as every week it was the Kirk, Spock and McCoy show. Let's meet the other characters and explore with them. More Detmer please. More Reno too. Also Tilly as F/O is hard to believe and lose the dead Trill.",27 December 2020
"Really wanted to like it. No I mean REALLY wanted to like it.

Too much focus on interpersonal character relationships.

Yes we know its trendy to promote female power and LGBT but honestly taking too much away from the main story at times.

I get it, but not for me, despite being a fan if Sci-fi series in general.

Is it horrible? No. Is it Great? Again No. It could have been, but no.

If I wanted to watch a soap opera , I would , don't force it on me when im in the mood to watch entertaining Sci-fi, Thanks.",27 November 2021
"So far so good. Looks like the plot follows the story telling with suspense and climax. Perhaps it is not exactly like the old generation star trek but it does follow the movie line with lots of potential to cultivate. Good works, it is like a mini movie to bring back star trek to life again. Perhaps captain Georgiou will be brought back to life as villain. Since the first two episodes were trying to bring in new story line, it might not earn existing star trek fans compliments, but I am sure they will enjoy the show once it is approaching the end of the season. By the way, what happened to Voyager? Perhaps it shall show on TV series too, otherwise, it is hard to connect star trek with the old star trek as a real star trek series. Still remember Captain Jean-Luc Picard became a villain once before reversed engineering to become himself again? Cheers",25 September 2017
"I found myself enjoying the series more when I wasn't trying to reconcile it with the Star Trek universe. This is NOT in the Prime universe, I don't care what the marketing claims.

Just ten years before STOS and not a fragment of a sign of anything from the original series. The tech is wrong. The bridge is wrong. The attitudes of Star Fleet is wrong. The saucer on the Discovery spins for god sake. Huh? Who came up with that bad idea? And why? Just because you could do it in CGI?

And the Klingons are the species that can cloak, contradicting Bird of Prey canon. Klingons got the tech later. Not here though. Been around for ten years, but nobody told original series characters.

Finally, there is the interesting, but completely ""out of universe"" Spore Drive. I LOVED the idea. But it ain't Star Trek. Was never mentioned by Kirk or Spock and has no shadow in anything afterward.

Also, something lacking in both this series and the Abrams series is any sense that these shows represent a blueprint for the future. Unlike Lost in Space, Star Wars, 2001 or any contemporary sci fi, Star Trek always presented a world and a humanity the way it SHOULD be. Here's what we could become. Here's what we can accomplish. Now it's all lens flares and laser beams. Pew! Pew!

With that out of my system....I still enjoyed the series. I like the long story told over several episodes. I love the characters. Captain Lorca. Michael Burnham. The one guy. They are great actors and great characters. They kept me engaged.

So long ranting review short. Great sci fi but the only thing Star Trek in it are the badges and the basic shape of the ships.",7 December 2017
"I'm a millennial who grew up on TNG and DS9 reruns, and Discovery is the first Star Trek series to air since I graduated high school. I went into this show wanting to like it. I keep trying to like it, but I can't.

It's not the ""wokeness."" Star Trek has always been progressive and anyone who can't see that never understood Gene Roddenberry. What sucks about Discovery is... nearly everything else. The cast and the effects team give it their all, but there's just not much to work with. Each season has the same storyline: 1. The whole universe is gonna be destroyed by X. 2. Discovery putters around space for 8-10 episodes, following X around and occasionally getting into hijinks along the way. 3. Michael Burnham saves the universe. Very paint-by-numbers.

Since the writers aren't clever enough to give any storyline more than superficial treatment, they put all their energy into interpersonal drama. So. Much. Interpersonal. Drama. Unfortunately, for audiences to be invested in that, the characters need to be likable. They aren't. The more likable characters on Discovery (Saru, Jett Reno, Owosekun, Dr. Culber) barely register any screen time . Maybe 10% of the show focuses on the crew in general. What's left is about 10% Tilly/Adira (depending on the season) and 80% Michael Burnham, and man is that a mistake. Tilly is annoying and barely fit to be an ensign. Adira is a know-it-all Trill with ten lifetimes' worth of experience, but acts like a present-day neurotic teenager. Big Wesley Crusher vibes, except no one ever tells them to shut up. Neither character inspires me to care about their drama.

Michael Burnham, meanwhile, is loathsome. She starts the series a mutineer, and that never really presents a problem because yayyy she ended a war she started in the first place. Burnham constantly makes everything about her, and the rest of the cast are happy to oblige. You see, Michael Burnham has the tragic backstory of losing her parents at a young age and being adopted by rich Vulcans, so characters who have PTSD or have lost a spouse or have lost contact with their entire species must comfort Michael Burnham, whom the show tells us has suffered most of all. Focusing so much on her is a huge misstep, and it's one that can't be rectified without retconning the character or making Discovery a completely different show. Sometimes it borders on parody. In one episode, an away mission needed a doctor, and Dr. Culber sent Burnham in his place because she's the main character so it must be so. Insane.

Every once in a while, Discovery shows a glimmer of potential. There are a few genuinely good episodes, especially in late season 2 and early season 3. Then the next episode it's back to tearful melodrama, and I sigh.",27 December 2021
"You people make me feel ashamed, quickly dismissing this show because of the silliest of reasons. Give this show a chance. Remember how everyone wanted Enterprise to be cancelled... well by the time it was being cancelled WE ALL BEGGED FOR IT TO CONTINUE! Remember TNG's beginning and how average it was? Can you imagine if they pulled the plug before season 3???

The silliness in ""This isn't Gene Roddenberry vision"" is just plain stupid. But you're right, he definitely wouldn't like this show, but you know what else he didn't like? The wrath of khan, He even had doubts about Star trek 6, likely he would of hated and Deep Space Nine.

I respect if you legitimately don't like the show, if it's not your cup of earl grey. Not every star trek show can be as optimistic as TNG, because it's not always exciting. But the amount of 1 star reviews for silly bullshit just sickens me.

up to episode 4 now and it'e becoming more Trek each episodes, Klingons are behaving more Klingony, the crew is warming up, Michael's getting better.

The pilot was a movie, a prologue, but the real pilot is E03: ""Context is for Kings"" and it shows. I can't rate the show so far as the seasons not done yet, and episodes aren't too stand- alone, but at the moment its 8.5ish for me. off course its not perfect, but its definitely not trash, unless you're purposely blinding yourself in the hate.",9 October 2017
"Amazing how narrow minded people are, in this case old Star Trek fans. Shake their old time Star Trek just a tiny bit and everything is a disaster. These people would give any Shakespeare performance a one star if it wasn't performed in an original theater, in original clothing and spoken in the original way.

I'm a Star Trek fan and I've watched every one of them. I started watching Star Trek as a kid in the 70's. Some of the best are the old ones. The one prior to this one, Enterprise, was the worst ever, with only lame acting and 95% one to one conversation, like a poor soap opera. I was so disappointed. Now cones this, Discovery, and finally some real storytelling, real action, good science, NICE graphics and filming. EVERYTHING is great in this Star Trek. The best Star Trek ever, no doubt.

Stop living in the past, fossils. Let Star Trek catch up to a modern Star Trek, one that is more complete in every way.",26 October 2017
"I think that people judged Discovery way too soon and yes, it is not more of the exact same formula from the past Series(which would be a total lack of innovation) in the franchise yet people forget that the first seasons from now-iconic DS9, Voyager and even TNG didn't do very well and almost got these shows canceled. I personally believe that it is good to have a Star Trek series back after so many years with new unseen stuff (Yet familiar enough to feel like Trek/Trek-Ish for some). Let's wait and see what the show has to offer in the next season, maybe then it will be fair to have a more reasonable opinion about it.",2 March 2018
"First of all, this series does not deserve to be trashed after two episodes. Frankly, no TV- show should be considered ""garbage"" or ""beyond terrible"" based on so little data. Most pilots are not great ( although there are those that exist) and Star Trek: Discovery was launched into space with a mighty long prologue. These two episodes feel like the first 30 pages of a book that is promising but you have to get through the slow beginning at first.

I am a big admirer of the Star Trek universe and the franchise, but I also feel that there is room for something new. I threw myself over the cliff into the unknown with Discovery because I was very adamant in not comparing it to the old. There is nothing that stops me from being a fan of both. Yes, there are a lot of people giving low scores and expressing their outrage/disgust/disappointment/etc. in regards to Discovery. I'm not saying that they should be ignored. Those concerns may or may not be valid, but then again we all have certain evaluative standards when it comes to capturing the true ""essence"" of Star Trek and values are often subjective. There is no point in converting anyone to their specific Star Trek religion. It is simply a matter of personal preference and has nothing do to with ""good"" or ""bad"".

That being said, I think Star Trek:Discovery should be discovered on one's own, without comparing an essentially innovated Star Trek with the ones Trekkies consider good old classics. The writers are people with a different set of human experience, ideologies and ideas on what a series such as Star Trek can be right now or might be in the future. There is absolutely no rule written in stone that declares Star Trek cannot be re-invented, shaped to fit into the modern world, or even transformed.

At its core, Star Trek:Discovery wants to be a sci-fi series that creates a cohesive unit from what we know and what we love, but it might just end up being a series that creates a story within the story. The two first episodes already show the lead character Burnham as an outcast - not Vulcun, but also not entirely human like. Engineered by logic but also flawed by emotion. She doesn't fit.

Overall, I personally enjoyed the potential. The prologue was not the story, so liking or disliking it has no value. It is the potential of the series that will grow from the introductory two episodes that keeps me hooked. It may not be perfect or Star Trek enough for some fans but it still has the making of a good series by itself. Characters can grow, elements may be added or taken away, story lines can expand and the old can be tampered with. There is nothing that stops this series from developing further. Again, a pilot episode cannot deliver enough punch to make us soar through warp for an entire season, therefore it should not be taken as the only marker that defines it.

Also as a side-note: I'm willing to pay good money to see Jason Isaacs in anything, so there's that. He could be the guy who cleans the ship's lavatory and I would still watch Star Trek:Discovery.

"From the beginning, I've followed and loved (most) Star Trek. But this is not Star Trek. This is a sob fest crossed with crossed with disobedient child!

Missed opportunity, mainly botched by faulty characters. Michael could have been so much more. Actually, her character should have been a couple levels less aggressive than Philippa, without the crying and only ""near"" romantic episodes.You would have done better if you modeled Janeway

I can't take any more of this. So disappointing.",26 November 2020
"STD is one of worst WRITTEN shows on television only Batwoman is worse ! STD is mind-numingly boring predictably underwhelming and dumb space drama ! There is no logic, they lack their own internal continuity ! Last 3 seasons is about some galaxy ending threat - how original ! Mostly unlikable characters like Galaxy savoir Micheal Bhurnam, episodes with less Micheal or someone constantly remind how great Micheal is are better ones !

Rated 4* for good visual effects, except for make up and cheaply reused sets/props !",13 October 2021
"Discovery is by far the best Star Trek series ever. Picard was cute in way (probably 6 or 7) but this is maybe a masterpiece, it ties so beautifully together and captures the spirit of the original Kirk Star Trek like none of all the other spin offs does.

Great and highly memorable characters that you will learn to love, witty and funny dialogue and a great mixture between action and emotion.

Highly recommend!",7 April 2020
"As a Star Trek appreciater (I like ToS, TNG and Voyager - DS9 was a disaster, Enterprise was unwatchable as are the new movies), this series messed with me. At first, I hated everyone. I thought it was a disgrace, the ultimate insult to Starfleet. I wanted them all prosecuted as war criminals.

The season was divided into two parts, and I assume anyone who is reading this has already watched it so I won't waste time with summarization. The end of the first part left me angry. Very angry!!! They even freaked me out by putting in an Al Green song (I love Al Green, but does it really belong in Star Trek???). I suppose this had already been done in Star Trek: First Contact (my favorite TNG movie) with ""Magic Carpet Ride"" which is the only part that grated on me. To put pseudo-contemporary pop or R&B as it may be into the actual TV show, kind of upset me, though I would quote Prince about Michael Burnham ""Sho'nuff do be cookin', in my book'"" (and I love your hairdo). One of the things that I have come to grudgingly accept about the movies is that they like to make characters do stupid things that they wouldn't do in the TV show, an egregious example being Data saying ""lock and load"" in Insurrection. I guess it gets laughs from the audience or something.

The first episode of the seond part (the best episode of the season in my opinion) directed by Jonathan Frakes was a catharthsis of sorts for me if only because the put Lorca into ""the agonizer"", but really it was a lot more well-paced and just all around better and more effective than the rest.

Anyhow, to make a long story short, the last episode, which wrapped things up way to quick (this series has a tendency to pay to little attention to pacing, a bunch of developments happen really quick in between personal and interpersonal moments of self discovery), nevertheless pleased me... When the words ""We are Starfleet"" were uttered in the last episode after all that torture, I felt greatly reassured, and playing the theme song from TOS was a really, really nice touch after all that agony.

This is a very immature crew, I would love to see them grow up a little more. I would also like to get to know the rest of the bridge crew a little better assuming we are all alive a year from now.

(also I would like to change my star rating of Twin Peaks Season Three to 3 stars, but the rest of the review sort of stands, I had to say that).",12 February 2018
"Where the story goes is completely ludicrous. Seems that the writers never had a plan, or they did and abandon it on the fly.

The characters are TERRIBLE people...the audience has no connection to them because their idiotic decisions are not relatable. Also - the Klingons are boring low brow mush mouth morons...",31 January 2022
I have been watching star trek since the 70's i consider myself an expert. Well written slow to start but with time it is great im addicted to it. The theme song is awesome.,22 January 2019

"It's one of my first reviews on imdb (haven't connected since 2019 or such) and I felt the need to comment and rate this:
High quality CGI, mostly great characters that you get attached to and really root for, who actually look genuine alien (Saru, or the Klingon leader), excellent soundtrack, and so much interesting sub-plots intertwined with the main season plot.
Just try this for one season, and believe me, you'll binge it to the final episode of Season 3 in no time.

People should stop comparing it to other serios under the same franchise, in my opinion all are very good in their own way.",17 March 2021
"I watched first 3 episodes and was probably like the most of the more hardocre trekkie people...seemed fake, dark forced etc etc....but i kept on going and the more i watch it, i must admit...its a really good show. Well, good if you can get over your own bias and watch this show for what it is. And the more it progresses it seems to be getting more and more star trekky.

All in all, its fun. If you mlike sci fi as a genre at all, watch it! If this show was called something else but star trek, i bet it would have like 8 to 8.5 rating.",14 November 2017
"This show is garbage. I don't know what world this is, but it's not a functioning one. Hollywood might think so, but no way the world could function with people like this. It's totally unwatchable, after trying for several years now. Please cancel before the 'Star Trek' name is ruined totally! I liked Picard season one, and I like 'lower decks'.

No One likes this show!!",11 December 2021
"To be honest, I'm not surprised by what I've read in the reviews. Some even share that same wording and such as others, so it's pretty obvious that people have been signing up for multiple accounts to review this show. I've seen similar activities from the very vocal minority of haters on several other Websites, so all I can suggest to people that haven't watched Discovery yet is this - watch the show yourself, then decide if you like it or not. Just keep in mind that it is no different than any other Trek. The first season has rough spots, but it does get better as it goes along. The last half of season one was great, and season two has been mindblowing. Absolutely amazing. I do wish that they didn't focus on the character Michael Burnham so much, but overall it is a good show. The cast is brilliant - especially Doug Jones, Anson Mount, Jason Isaacs, Michelle Yeoh, Mary Wiseman, and Jayne Brook. The makeup (Andorians, Tellarites, Saurians, and Kelpians) and special effects are incredible. Is it dark? Yep, some, but so was DS9.

I'm one of the old Trekkie types that avoided Discovery when it first came out due to the stuff that I read on Facebook, etc.. So I went in expecting to despise it, but that turned out not being the case and I'm relieved. I missed having new Trek, and that's exactly what this is - Star Trek. Does it look new and follow along with what's happening in our current world? Yes, but so did all of the others. If the technology DSC has had been available during the production of all of the other series, they would have had it at well.

None of us can speak for Gene Roddenberry or how he would feel about DSC. But I do know that his son has been involved in the project from the very beginning, he's a producer. I take his support of the show more to heart than the word a disgruntled fan. There's also the fact that fan hate for new Trek isn't a Discovery-centric thing. The first movie with the original cast got bashed, TNG caught absolute hell, as did DS9, VOY, and ENT. Now DSC is catching the same flack from people that will never be happy with anything new. It deserves the same opportunity to prove itself as all of the others did, and if it was as bad as a lot of these reviews made it out to be it wouldn't have been renewed.",10 March 2019
"I've most likely seen all the Star Trek series and movies; even the cartoon. Star Trek for me is about modern day issues - religious dogma, political ideologies, philosophical concepts, cultural differences, social injustice, democracy, freedom and wars; simulated in a trekkie universe and i believe that is the message Gene Roddenberry wanted to tell.

Can i make a judgment after two episodes? No, not really; and just like all the other TV- Series in this franchise "" It grows on you and the characters you learn to love or hate ""

Was the first two episodes enough to give it a high or a low score; No. Was it a usual meaningless warmongering feast brought to you by a cynical TV- network; Yes. The problem within this series and at the same time its greatest feature, it has a huge old fan base, and that is the core audience. Why not let the old trekkie fan base mentor the new fan base without warmongering as a lesson.

Im convinced that in the first day at the Star Trek Academy they learn tolerance.

The first two episodes got half the message wrong, its about being on the edge of the universe and still holding on to humanity, not forcing it onto others.",25 September 2017
Why does Burnham have to give everyone she comes across a hug and a long winded emotional speech on the verge of tears. Why is everyone on the bridge a commander. Why does Burnham go off solo on missions apparently expert in every field so often leaving the ship. More sci-fi less hugging.,6 January 2022
"There is no fandom like the Star Trek fandom when it comes to complaining about change. It was the original. It is one of the loudest. Ironic considering that an ongoing theme throughout every single series is the idea of keeping an open mind, but we humans are an emotional race, of course.

There is fair criticism: it being very focused on Michael Burnham being the most accurate. It is much less of an ensemble than previous Treks have been, which in my opinion leaves it feeling like more of a spin-off than anything. In addition, they have taken unnecessary and somewhat off-putting visual direction in places, particularly with the Klingons - I mean just why? It's as though they just did it to troll their most trollable followers. Then there's the wobbly camera, the jaunty camera angles, the dingy sets...It's trying too hard to be down with the kids and missing by a mile.

However, all that said, a lot of the complaints are just reactionary nonsense. ""IT'S NOT STAR TREK!!1"", I see repeated over and over, and that's really very unfair. Just a few episodes into the first series you're dealing with themes of racial identity, racial tension, corrupt power, not judging a whole person based on single factors, the ethics of animal testing for scientific development, the treatment of prisoners of war, the effects of PTSD...I could go on. They're just not presented in the in your face ""this is the issue we're looking at today children"" way that they would have been in the older series. If people are missing these things then it being dumbed down is not the issue.

As for it being ""dark"", honestly that's laughable. It's darker than TOS and TNG definitely, but that's really not hard. I'd put it on par with DS9 which was full of war crimes, grey morality, rebel sympathy, religious bigotry, eugenics, racism, the whole bag. Of course it broke that up with the ""comic relief"" like Quark's disgusting objectification of women, the ambiguous relationship between Bashir and O'Brien being played for laughs, the toxic masculinity Worf repeatedly threw at Jadzia, but that was just good fun right?

Anyway, I'll stop, I think you've probably either got my point or furiously downvoted me by now. I would certainly not be put off by the most critical of critics here though, make up your own mind, be objective, THAT is Star Trek.",21 October 2020
"Loved it plain and simple. I cant wait for more! All these negative comments make me want to puke if any of you tits love star trek then i would give high praise as if this flops you wont see a new show anytime soon so if that's what you want keep bashing.

my only complaint and its not a big one as im not sure about the Klingon looks but if i remember right its do to them not dealing with that virus that changed there looks either way when i saw the new look of the Klingons i wasn't sure i liked it but come the end of the second show i was digging the look i also like the new look of the architecture inside their ships. My fingers are crossed that this show stays on air for a decade or more.",26 September 2017
"I liked it but this is not why I came in to comment..,,it perplexes me that this series' rating has defied the laws of maths ....90% of the reviewers give it a 1, 2 or 3 ...so how come it gets an average rating of 7.4?",27 December 2020
"Being one of the few high ratings, I have wondered where I went wrong.

Yes, it is not Roddenberry's universe. We know the plot as it is 'history' in most Star Trek presentation.

Till their return from season break, my rating would have been four to five.

Great return, can hardly wait to see the next episode. The development of war and being part of it is another progression point.",12 January 2018
"1st rule of any drama - does characters come anywhere near real speech? This is set in the Star Trek Universe but should take place in Port City at General Hospital with all the dramatic speeches. These characters don't talk, they stand on soap boxes and make non nonsensical, illogical statements. They take bold positions and then don't follow through on any of it. Reminds me of Voyager at times with some awful writing and occasional bad acting/storylines.

The over arching storyline isn't bad (although in the ""real world"" the lead character would have been in military prison), the special effects are great. But wow, the awful acting by several of the characters are cringe worthy. The female lead is solid, well done Star Trek mold. Jason Issaacs is good choice as Captain. Doug Jones is very believable ""alien"" 1st officer.The love interest, Shazad Latif, was a good storyline and the highlight of the season. He was the best part of this season and probably will take on more in season 2...but from there it goes downhill fast...Mary Wisemen as the the funny side kick has some good lines, but she is about 30 lbs overweight to be believable as a young Ensign in a military organization. The Admiral, is pathetic, can someone teach her how to deliver a line like someone who is allegedly in charge? and the lead engineer, is just downright awful.

For trekkies, it's great to return to the Universe, which is very pro female (unlike the Star Wars universe). Strong female lead characters, evil Klingons, and last minute twists to save the day. Let's get some better dialogue writing for season 2 please. Without giving away plot, they steal too many Star Trek stories for my taste too. Go in with low expectations and you'll be fine. But it's no STNG or Deep Space 9",27 November 2018
"Stop destroying Star Trek legacy. It has never been about this ridiculous amount of personal feelings. It is about science fiction and moral decision making wrapped in exciting action and cool gadgets.

"First this is way more better than those 1-2 stars ratings. How can you judge the serie before, you have seen more than pilot episode or few more? Give Discovery a chance. The old Star trek is old classic, this is something else.

Yes, there are some big flaws. First the plot. Why to make it so complicated? Not like this.Next one Then all crew members are too distant. Meaning you never feel that if some one dies, you would feel sad or angry. You feel empty. Third: Its not getting better after episode 10.

Then good sides: Main character is is intresting.Nice to see female main character.Serie is not copying any other series/movies that has been already made. Some good new ideas.

So what to say. Starting was intresting, now its losing the touch. 7/10 because 1-2 stars are not fair(Go watch battleship movie thats worth of 2 stars)just wanna raise average points. TOTAL fair review score 6/10.",11 February 2018
"...even Star Trek Picard, - but this is just woke sh.....

Well, this is the first Star Trek series I quit watsching, because of it's agenda, other than ""exploring new worlds"".

It's a pitty, that entertainment today has to be that unreaslistic, and I don't speak about spore drive, but about the insane immense amount of LGTBQ+++ figures in many new seires, which has noting to do with real world, real environment.

It's simply unrealistic, as said, the spore drive is more plausible than that much ""special people"" in one ship...

And the story otherwise, - well - DS9 and the fire-caves were more beliveable.. Sorry, for me that's not Star Trek anymore, that's just trivial... Star Trek was always modern, against the mainstream, look at it now - a disgrace... mainstream all over... no future in it at all...",14 December 2021
"I loved these Star Trek Discovery TV series from the very first episode. As it went along my admiration only grew.

The actors/The sets/The costumes/The stories - and the imaginations, that gave us such enthralling action. In the very end, it did preach a little...but whether or not we like being preached to, what was said was a lesson we as a human race need to hear.

I will now give it a week or so before I go back and rewatch every episode of all 4 series. Personally, I do hope we have more, though I bet Doug Jones as Saru won't miss having to get all his gear on and deserves an accolade of his own, for walking on those feet with his swinging arms. A wonderful character.

It's a welcome addition to the Star Trek family",19 April 2019
"I am not a trekkie, I watched a few of the old movies and some episodes of the different series along the way, I am more of a sci-fi fan in general. I have only just watched episode 2 and can already tell, this is up there with battlestar galactica and stargate universe, I really enjoyed the 3 latest Star Trek movies and this series is more in the direction of those and in my opinion this series gives the franchise the same type of upgrade.

If you want an action packed sci-fi series that has decent acting then this is for you, if your a old Trekkie that wants the days of will shatner back then you might be disappointed.

I can't believe all the low scores, too many fan boys giving low scores when a new series is slightly different (but still better in my view) than other Star Trek ones. If the lows scores nearly put you off giving this a try, then after watching episode one... Put up your own thoughts.",4 October 2017

Now, I'm a HUGE fan of the new series. Everything has been updated. It's pure ""eye candy"" with all of the new sets, special effects, and costumes. I love the fresh new stories and how the show gives depth to all of the characters.

"There isn't a Star Trek iteration that I don't like. It's complete pseudoscience and has been from the first ever series, but you kind of have to accept that if you want FTL, aliens, a galactic federation and many episodes over many generations.

In that sense, this series is no different to its predecessors. It's full of nonsensical happenings. At the same time, however, this series is unlike any before it, which is perhaps why it has quite a few detractors. Yes, this is diversity heavy. Racial diversity, sexual diversity... every single human is represented in some way, but it's only 'political agenda' is equality, which is pretty much no different to all the Star Trek iterations before it (hence: different but the same).

But what I like about this iteration is that characters seem more human. This, imo, started with Voyager, where human characters actually act like human characters rather than robots trying to imitate human emotion. That is, people cry and laugh and sometimes mess about even when on the job. Given all the pseudoscience people accept, it's really not that hard to imagine slips of professionalism every now and then.

Overall, it's pretty far-fetched and camp (again, like every other iteration before it), but there's something fun about it (like every other iteration before it). And as a white man who's watched every episode to date, I can honestly say that I do not feel positioned as inferior or bumbling because of Michael Burnham.. I mean, I honestly can't believe how triggered some people are in these reviews, not because of poor writing but because of imagined agendas or 'politics' that regards minorities as existing and equal? So, 'equality' bad? Yeah okay, that doesn't jive with the meaning and heart of this franchise whatsoever, but okay. Head on over to PureFlix where a straight white guy will play every protagonist on every show (quite literally).

7/10 - great visuals, a great protagonist and lots of fun in deep space with our different but the same human comrades (aliens too).",8 February 2021

"Each season of this show gets better and better. The stories are in perfect sync with the Star Trek universe. The characters are more real and emotionally vulnerable than the vast majority of TV shows in which everyone is a caricature. The visuals are beyond spectacular. As with any complex multi year show, there are a few characters that annoy me. I think that would technically take my rating from 10 stars to 9.99 stars. I hope this show continues for another 10 seasons. It's that good.",21 December 2020
"Firstly I'd like to say I've not seen series three yet. But I really enjoyed seasons one and two. It's well written with a good amount of emotional attachment. I was excited by the links to the original series and the way those stories linked together. It's not highbrow and it's not preachy. It's just space opera at its best. Ignore the negative reviews and give it a chance, you might be surprised.",27 February 2018
"Details that make a movie good or bad (yes it's fantasy, but show some intelligence to help us out): 1. Why do Klingons have a mouth, a nose, two eyes, etc. for a completely alien species they show look like human knockoffs. I know it's cheaper to make rubber mask prosthetics to fit a human. Their language even has a grammatical structure similar to all the Indo-European languages. Usual contact lenses. No imagination. 2. Two animated moons one of which is so close/large that it's tidal forces would tear itself and it's planet apart. I guess someone's basic grade school gravitational physics wasn't passed. 3. Star ship uses small combustion/flame propulsion to hover land makes no sense & not even ball park able to handle the mass of that ship. Space ships look awesome cute, but fail basic engineering principles. More dumb science. For some reason said flame didn't move when ship started accelerating forward. 4. Same old loads of computer screen displays as prop background to represent tech. Same old laser in vacuum of space sound/visuals that look flashy, but again fail grade school science. 5. Same old tired 20th century (mostly naval) make believe language: Recalibrating sensors; navigation coordinates (a couple of numbers w/decimal points added) useful only old Earth; displacement activated space hub drive (huh!); unable to materialize in the known universe (well then, maybe the unknown universe); travel on a network of mycelium (the universe has a fungi construction?); tardigrade for navigation (from flea sized to oversized so what does it do with it's 8 legs, mouth, etc. in space - chew on rocks?, walk on nothingness?). 6. Same old plot antagonists; same old daytime actors giving us the usual character issues.",8 December 2018

I imagine if you are a fan of the franchise you might have issues but for the rest of you its a really good show. Have fun with.,11 January 2019
"At the start, as a die-hard trekkie, just hated every detail of this series.

unlike other star trek series, it was focused too much on violence as its main drive. but now, after giving it up at first attempt and again giving it a go ahead with finishing 2nd season, i gotta admit i'm loving it.

i admint that every start, i was very skeptical. hated machael character, hated sarek, hated pike... at start of the first season, and at the start of the second season... stories seemed tooo difficult and banal at best with my skepticism taking over me.

but trust me, if you remember what the star trek is about, its interaction with characters, its relationships, bonding, peace, science...and can get past the part where it feels like... too far away from star trek's ideals, you will see that it successfully captures it, embraces it.

also, at the early stage of the season two, where it links with THE original series with captain Pike, I was just amaze how much effort was put into this. this is one of good stories linking up with core of star trek, and am grateful that this series exists. hope it continues and hope to see more from it.",9 June 2019
"This is the best Star Trek - straight from the start. The other series have always had a rocky start and struggled to find its footing but Discovery found it straight from the start.

Sonequa Martin-Green truly understands what it is to be human with a Vulcan heritage; she performs her lines in between the two contrasting cultures. Georgiou plays as her mentor, almost her god parent and guides her to becoming human again.

The music is surreal, the special effects rival any blockbuster movie from this year and the story grips. This is The Next Generation of Star Trek and could potentially become a viral hit if it continues its strong vibe from the first two episodes.",24 September 2017
"That's the first 5 episodes out of the way, so what do I think...

Well, the cast is excellent: some truly excellent actors and many who are very competent. Jason Isaacs never dips below ""very good"" in anything he does and frequently ventures into ""outstanding"" territory. What I've seen so far gives me no reason to expect otherwise here. Doug Jones is great as Saru, Anthony Rapp makes a very decent eccentric engineer and as for the remainder, it's really too early to tell how they'll do. Martin-Green is perhaps the one let-down, as she seems a bit strained and wooden so far. Still, it's early days still and plenty of time for things to improve.

The one thing that's sure, and which has already been well established, is that this isn't Star Trek for the Trekkies. As for me, I've never been one of those. The lore and canon holds little to no interest for me, so the flood of niggles based on Klingon foreheads and such are of no consequence.

The ""feel"" of the show is a slightly different matter. Having watched and loved TNG, DS9, Enterprise and Voyager (and some of the original series, but that's just too dated for me to enjoy), Discovery has a very different feel to it. It really does feel like a hybrid of Star Trek and Star Wars, having lost the slightly gritty, low budget feel that's always been there before. Nothing inherently wrong with that as far as I'm concerned; the fact that the budget is is less constrained is a good thing, as is the fact that computer technology and with it special effects technology has moved on tremendously.

However, for me at least Star Trek has always been about going boldly where no man has gone before. In other words: discovery of new races, new phenomena, new regions of space, new dilemmas and new whateveryoucanthinkof. Being a Sci-Fi show Discovery does retain some of that, of course, but the focus appears to have shifted markedly towards action and war. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Too early to say I think, although for many it's obviously distinctly bad, but there's no doubt that this isn't Star Trek as we knew it. I guess we'll just have to wait and see/hope, and if we presume that once again some 5, 6, 7 series is the aim then there's certainly scope for some traditional Star Trek exploration and discovery down the line.

Anyway, for now I'll give it a six. It's enjoyable as is, I'm sure it'll improve as the cast grows into the roles and each other and it's too early to judge the story, plot line(s) and what it'll end up feeling like.

Fingers crossed.",28 October 2017
As a star trek fan of many many years I was hugely disappointed with this series. This series is populated by an assortment of extremely annoying characters many of whom I took great delight in witnessing their demise at the hands of the Klingons. Why on earth an actor of the calibre of Jason Isaccs agreed to appear in this series is beyond me. No more please.,18 December 2021
"I am a star trek nut. Own all the box sets. Watched them more than once. That out of the way, the new series. If you go and watch all the first episodes of all of the series, they take a while to settle in to it. For a first round this is not too bad. The klingons look very different and a bit scary, so probably not a great idea to let your 6 year old watch. All in all there is a story going here with good character development. The critics might be over critical of this too early-on?",27 September 2017

Im no Trekkie and but have watched various incarnations over the years. Ive always found the various series pretty cheesy compare to shows like the Galactica reboot but the original series is an indelible part of your childhood . The reboot by JJ Abrams was also pretty good. Having said that I enjoyed Discovery.

There are some not so much that gives fader to kill off. I don't see this as a reboot but a fresh take/view into The franchise. I can't wait to see where it goes.",15 March 2018

So first instead of stand-alone episodes, Discovery creates a coherent story for its season and well... it doesn't really work. The main story line is often interrupted by pointless side missions or is eventually dropped anyway for a whole episode. Also the discovery itself with its weird spore drive and so on, is such a weird and random deus ex machina, that it eliminates any suspense or gravitas that might develop.

Second they tried some new characters and development... and it really doesn't work that well. Personally, I really do not like Michael, or actually most of the crew. They are mostly the same smooth, flawless super characters usually seen in Star Trek. So Michael was stripped of rank, should I care? Cause she is on the ship anyway and no one seems to really care about it. Locar and Georgiu are the only characters that are different (for obvious reasons), and much more entertaining to watch. Also, the ship is stuffed with side characters that are just used for one episode and then disappear again. THere is one episode where one of the bridge crew is taken to a colony that is anti-technology, because she comes from a Luddite background. AND that is all she has to say and contribute in this episode?! Why? You could create something out of this, a story for her or anything, but no it is just dropped and forgotten. Nightflyers also featured a former Luddite character, and they used this to create motivation, story lines and motivation for her. Frustrating. Also why does Spock have to be in this Star Trek? The relationship with Michael is so forced and random, that all his scenes become so as well.

Third, they tried something a bit darker... but did they really? Because there is a lot of quipping here and there,and as I said before it is always obvious that the crew and the ship will make it mostly intact. So maybe it is a bit darker than other Star Trek series, but it is not Game of Thrones or anything.

Forth, so will I watch the next season? Sure thing it is still Star Trek, which I love besides all its constant flaws and disappointments.",15 December 2021
This show became literally unwatchable. In the beginn it was fresh and exciting. Now it is just some liberal nonsense. Tilly as an overweight officer constantly engaging in action packed missions...wtf At some point everything doesnt fit together anymore.,9 December 2021
"As any good Star Trek, this series is boldly taking on a new perspective to tell a story of deeply-rooted optimism. While this got only spelled out in the last episode, Michael Burnham's unwavering character never let me doubt that we'd get there through all the darkness. I also love the acting, the production, the new design of the Klingons, the intro (which I watch through every time), everything. I don't know whether Michael Burnham will make it to the rank of captain in the course of the series, but to me she's already a worthy successor (or predecessor) of Kirk, Picard, Cisco, and Janeway.",22 February 2018
"I have to admit I was not rushing to watch this series...but I have finally got round to it and am enjoying it.

Yes, we do have to question what role it plays in the star trek universe but as a sci-fi program with spaceships, creatures, shooting, the odd swearword and a bit of gore, I think it does well...

....but I can appreciate how some feel it is a let down for something associated with star trek.

Give it a go, marvel at the picture and sound quality (am watching on a very big screen and through DTS neural X) and you may enjoy it.",12 October 2018
"Another example of how big business uses a ""known"" title to draw folks into a bad show that has nothing to do with the subject matter. While this show has it's moments - it is not what you would expect from Star Trek and would have been better off creating a new fleet, a new world, and new life forms to tell their stories. There isn't a bright spot in this show - it is a cash cow for Paramount using a famous brand to bring in dollars.",9 April 2020
"Let's start by being very clear: this is not Star Trek of the 90s and this seems to upset a lot of people.

Unlike nearly everything up to now in Trek, it isn't episodic, instead it feels bigger and more epic with overarching story lines running for an entire series. It has dared to redesign some elements and dared to not focus on the captain (at first). It even does some audacious retconning, and indeed canon/continuity in the first 2 series is treated loosely. Its characters are different to what we've seen before, not all are likeable even. It deals with emotions and consequences far more than it's predecessors too and episodes can even be very character led rather than event-led.

I really enjoy it - it does have its flaws of course. Burnham is basically a superhero and there is sometimes too much emotion wrangling when the plot is trying to tell us they should act with urgency... but no show is perfect!

To be honest, if you only want 90s style Trek with a mystery of the week then this isn't for you. Nearly all the negative reviews are about it not being this (or weirdly, the diversity of the cast gets some people riled too).

But if you approach it with an open mind, you will enjoy it as it is well made and at its best can be amazing.",3 December 2021
"Best Star Trek ever, great story line and love the twists. Brilliant",7 August 2018
A great sci-fci TV series. It will take some episodes to get to the interesting point but once it reaches there it maintains it. It feels like you are a member of star fleet as well. Some characters are great like suru.,9 May 2019
"I have officially stopped watching Discovery now. It is an appealing show although not strictly Star Trek. Many of the characters are ill defined, I can only name 4 off the bridge, Detmer, Saru, Tilly and Burnham. Saru is an excellent character and Tilly is fairly well defined, but we know nothing at all about Detmer and she appears to be in a fog most of the time. Burham...omg...I am FED UP of that character. Most of her lines are whispered, and the majority of what she says is either affronted at someone/something, or intensely emotional. There's no real balance showing a range of emotions and mindsets. I am sick of having to turn on the subtitles to hear her and when I do her dialogue is fevered passionate questioning, or seemingly reciting lines from some inspirational Sufi text. If Burnham left Discovery forever I may start watching it again as an entertaining show, but I doubt that will happen so I am ending it now. Enterprise was a washed out mish mash of rubbish, Discovery is an appealing sci fi series, but neither are the real Star Trek and I fear the greatness of the past is going to be lost forever unless some fantastic writers and producers bring something out of the bag for the next Series.",3 December 2020
"First 2 seasons have been the best start to a Trek series ever! Great characters and stories! Visuals are amazing!

Looking forward to where they take us in season 3!

Just wish the trolls would quit it with their multiple fake accounts and their damn agenda of hate!",24 January 2020
"Well, another decade another star trek. The story is good enough I guess, it makes for a nice view. EXCEPT... this series suffers from the same thing a lot of series suffer from at the time. It is not about the journeys, it's not about the trek, it's about miss Michael. It's not about the crew as a whole, it's about one individual. Mostly it looks like miss green took a few acting lessons on how to cry semi convincingly and wants to put it to good use. That's a bit disappointing. I mean, we know all about how Michael's childhood was, who she grew up with etc. But how about Tilly? In what kind of accident was our helmsman that caused her to have the weird eye and hairdo? Come on people, it really isn't that hard to create some depth and backstory.

Tng, ds9, heck even Voyager and Enterprise had more backstory to the characters. Not to be too blunt, but I think Mr Roddenberry would not have liked where this is going.

Even so, a mild six stars due to the beautiful visuals and interesting story arc.",23 November 2020
"In the fourth season and I'm rewriting my review. Females everywhere and very little males. Have the eradicated all males in the future? All top positions are women or of some sort, no men. Even the enemies are females. I'm getting tired of the ""girlpower"" thing. You would think that the future would be little more equal. Guess not.",3 December 2021
The acting from the main characters is superb. Especially onequa Martin Green is amazing in her acting. She definately deserves to have a leading role in a big sci-fi movie. I really dont care about bad reviews. I like her expressions and being so dramatic it brings something different. Just finished watching season 2 and the last 2 episodes was like a dream. It was like watching game of thrones in space but better and without unnecessary naked scenes.,3 January 2021
This show is awesome don't care what the butthurt hardcore Trekkies think,24 August 2018
"Previously reviewed 10/10 had to change that, started off well but got completely lost in season 2 seemed to be all over the place Disappointed",10 February 2020
"I actually created an account just to post my point of view on this as I feel it is being unfairly flamed. However it does have a lot to live up to.....

The visual effects, set pieces, special effects and makeup are all amazing. Great eye candy. However, the guts of the two pilots are not quite.

The writing, seemed a little illogical at points. And the beginning had an absurd amount of cheese, cringe sort of bad.. And the dialogue fairly stale, both in the script and in its delivery by Martin-Green and Yeoh. However it is the opening two episodes so we'll see how this plays out.

I did however find the cinematography not too bad and the emerging plot interesting. I especially like how they are diving more into the world of the Klingons, motives and culture.

The people who are saying there wasn't character development I have to disagree with. I will say it was rushed, crammed even. However it was definitely there. I can count 6 good character moments off the top of my head. However they felt too obviously ""placed"" for the sake of the script.

AS FOR the break in continuity between the set design (LCD Screens, holograms and different Klingons). This is something that especially annoys the loud geeks who can tell you exactly which EPS conduit you need to divert power through in case of a power failure in sector blah blah on a Miranda Class Cruiser. It isn't the 1960s/90s anymore. If you have a show where the Klingons look the same as humans just with black hair, a beige shirt and silky pants it will get laughed at for the next 50 years. THEY HAVE to update the look or it will be laughable to the larger audience. Which is not the geeks like you and maybe me.

It's decent by modern TV standards. Ain't no Game of Thrones, but did we love that after its first two episodes? I bid you ask yourself that when you read these other reviews.",25 September 2017
"When TNG started... there was a behind the scenes Mantra that the writing team embraced. ""That this series wouldn't be about tech, space battles, but instead... It'll be about people, and the storms that we as human beings would navigate regardless of the day and age it takes place in.""

This series has carried on with this tradition beautifully while modernising its sets for a 2020 format.

Michael, one of many main characters, embodies not only the principles Starfleet was built on, but the compassion & patience each of us should strive for as human beings.

I can not express how pleased I have been while following this character through arguably one of the wildest rides in science fiction.

Worth a watch and equally a buy. Some of the best Trek I've ever seen.",10 December 2020
"Probably the most disappointing of the star trek series, it is quite sad because there is also some good stuff, some great actors, some intresting characters. But so many ackward things... Burnham is really not a character that fit in the panel for a lot of reasons (and unfortunately she is the main protagonist), a few of the narrative decisions are really questionnable in term of coherence with the universe in the first place.

In term of realisation there is some nice visual effects and sets, and there is some intresting plots for some episodes, it is just hard to consider it in the global star trek timeline and universe, it seemed they wanted to reinvent some things and it really hardly work if you are familiar with the other series and content. If you plan on going through the whole thing, start with an open mind, otherwise it might be a bit painfull during some of the episodes.

It is still enjoyable, but do not expect the thrill you might had with other star trek series or movies.",19 December 2023
"You people are so whiny! The show is great! Best Star Trek I have ever seen (and I have seen them all)

What an epic way to finish season 3, stop whining because Michael cries a lot, who the hell cares! She's awesome! Every character loves their role! Amazing",9 January 2021
"Today it ended season 4. Hope that that this show is finished... Or better i am glad it is finally over. What a Terrible season it Dragggeeeeeeed so badly, it was one of the worst seasons of every star trek tv show to date. They cried more here than in 10 seasons of Greys Anatomy. What a soap opera. And the 10C is the worst species that star trek has ever created, or better copied from the movie ""the Arrival""... Oh Michael Burnham you wont be remembered as a great female character. Uhura, Janeway and 7 of 9 (That reprised her role in Picard), are 10 Million times better... Dam Michael isn´t even the best female character in her own show, the title must go to Michelle Yeoh´s character, Phillipa Georgiou... So Sonequa, in spite the fact i loved your The Walking Dead character, i think this experience was a utter Failure that i hopefully doesn´t comprimise your career... The Truth is that it wasn´t really your fault... The writers were terrible, woke, Emo, tried to appeal the millenialls taste, the LGBTQ+, and not the real Harcore Fans... I just hope That this does't destroy peoples faith in Star Trek Alltogether... Picard Season two is being very promissing.

And i hope Star Trek Strange New Worlds with Ethan Peck & Anson Mount recovers the old Star Trek vibe and mythos, and restores the canon that this show almost entirelly wrecked... My Final Score for this show is a 5 out of 10. And the first two seasons my score was a 7 out of 10. The last two seasons was a 3 out of10 (Mediocre) So Please just end this suffering... This is Stardate 18/03/22.",18 March 2022
"First off, yes it doesn't have the same feel of TOS or TNG. Since it's not made in the 60's or 80's, I expected, this. I also expected that the ship would not be look less advanced than the original enterprise. Why should a ship 200 years in the future have Christmas lights poking through cardboard like TOS? This is 2017.

This series so far looks gorgeous. The binary star system is incredible, even the desert creatures on the planet in the opening shot look really well done. Lightyears ahead of TNG or Voyager. It was nice not having to apologize to my wife for the cheesy effects like when I did when I conned her into watching TNG.

The characters so far feel interesting. Of course I miss Spock and Data, but what are you gonna do? I'm looking forward to see the characters develop. I am also hoping the actors begin to feel more comfortable in their roles as they are a little stiff (though MUCH better than TNG's first couple seasons).

Klingons... OK, I hated when the JJ Abrams reboot totally redesigned them an although the look is sorta based of that redesign.... holy crap. These Klingons are not messing around. They are truly a hardcore devout warrior race who are something too fear. Cheesy (yet adorable) Klingon's of the 80's...gone, replaced with a truly frightening foe.

Do I wish I could travel back in time and watch TNG for the first time again, yes of course but that's not happening. This new series has all the ingredients to be just as great, though different than our beloved childhood memories. We just need to be open and give it a chance. I was nervous going into it, but I loved it.",25 September 2017
"Some of the negative reviews are so wrong, don't be put off by them if it entertains you and keeps you watching of which it did. Job well done.",10 January 2021
"Most of Season 2 is one of the worst things to ever have come out of ST, except for the last episode or so of the year....when they jettison the fake Spock guy it helps.

Season 3 though is possibly the best thing they ever did, it's just mostly terrific. It set up a cool arc for Michael and her BF and they paid it all off.

Season 4 having lost it's main ani-hero who I guess they were going to spin off into antoher series which they cancelled (I'm now on 04 #3) seems at this point to be another train wreck/ not as bad as season 2, nothing could be, but wow it's just wandering around clueless. It gets all weepy about totally undeveloped characters no one cares about like Tilly, who at 250 pounds should never be wandering around in like sort of Ninja S & M outfits in ep 3 for like no reason at all. Music stinks. It could get better again who knows.",6 December 2021
"I have been brought up with Star Trek. It has been there my entire life. And for people to tear into this series is madness. Move with the times, this has everything you expect from a tv series in this day and age. Visually it is amazing, it has drama, actions, continuity errors to the minimum (S.W.A.T for example... OMG someone should be fired!) it's fresh and exciting with twists and new stories however it holds onto its principles. The people who gave this less than 5 stars couldn't do better, and if they tried it would be a terrible cliche attempt of some poor remake of the original series. Move on as this is what people want to see on TV at the moment. This is my first review ever but it needed to be said, give this a go if you like Star Trek but like modern action.",24 July 2018
Why the costume and make up change with the Klingons?! They kept them the same in other ways. The series is mildly enjoyable,1 March 2019

"Made it to episode 3 before giving up. Every week it's a competition between who loves who the most. You need a sickbag beside you, to make it through to the end. The writers need to calm down on the woke feelings.",1 January 2022
I really liked first season of Discovery despite the obvious divergences from the canon. Season two was a complete 180 and finally we got to see what Star Trek stands for for many of us. The introduction of captain Pike and Spock got Disco back to star trek roots and we got back a show that was recognizably star trek. I'm really sorry that Anson Mount won't be back next season and that's why many trekker signed the petition to ask for a spin off containing Pike Spock and the Enterprise crew,1 May 2019
"The reviews found on here illustrate that the show delivers on pushing boundaries like star trek always has. There were criticisms of Uhura/Chekov/Zulu back when TOS debuted, Janeway as the first female captain and Sisko in DS9. If your problem with the show is that you feel an inclusive agenda is being pushed than perhaps a review of yourself is more relevant.

If your problem is the overacting then you probably wouldn't like TOS, The original films or elements of any other series even Patrick Stewart goes full Shakespeare here and there!

That all being said the show does have some big issues, the writing seems all over the shop. Series 1 is tightly focused and well written but after that we veer into macguffin filled time paradox get outs with a lot of plot strands left unfulfilled or poorly satisfied.

It's an average show that's easy to switch off your brain and enjoy but if you're easily offended by a changing world perhaps a show set hundreds of years in the future isn't for you.",5 January 2021
"If your a fan of the Star Trek, this series is a new and original take on franchise. Interesting characters and well written series. It's fresh and aimed more for the adults not the pg rating of the previous series. I recommend this to anyone, it's up there with best.",29 June 2018
The show's greatest achievement is in understanding that TV has completely changed since Star Trek was last on our screens. It provides a grittier Trek than any we've seen before and top tier production standards. Big praise must go to Sonequa Martin-Green for her excellent central performance as Michael Burnham.,2 February 2019
"I watched almost every Star Trek series, which is a big word as there are a few, yet I became a fan when the J.J. Abrams version arrived, for me the 2009 Star Trek movie and those that followed were up on my favorites list in an instant. I was really looking forward to this series as it is features a lot of my favorite actors. I wasn't disappointed at all, it was great, I loved the third episode even more than I did with the first two. What I am disappointed in are hardcore Star Trek fans who are too butthurt to except new things. Guys, big news, the world is changing, movies and TV shows are changing big time and this fresh point of view Star Trek Discovery got is excellent. The characters are great so far, they are not clearly good or evil, they are interesting and likable. I don't know why you have to hold on to something and hope for the same so badly that you can't even accept the fact that new things can be good too. Going butthurt over things like: ""Oh it's not the same as the original was"" etc. for me is just too much. I enjoy this new adaptation, I like the characters and the actors are great, so I will definitely watch. Guys, if you never watched Star Trek don't get scared away by all this negative, butthurt trekies, watch it, and decide for yourself, don't let the reviews pull you away from the show :)",3 October 2017
"I'm not really tied into Trek canon; timelines, uniform design, etc.

That said, the new series is a hit and miss. Lots of FX goodies, set pieces and cool aliens , but the plot stumbled for me. Lots of clunky dialogue and character motivations that didn't make any sense (committing an act of mutiny isn't a great way to endear yourself to your captain and crew :)

My biggest problem though is with Micheal. Both as an actress and a character she completely lacks the energy, poise and charisma that's hallmark of a nascent star fleet captain. Hopefully she'll grow as a character but if she were replaced mid season I wouldn't complain.",25 September 2017
"This iteration of the Star Trek franchise seems to have lost its way having had a promising start in Season 1&2. There is now a great deal of heavy handed virtue signalling and the tendency Discovery has had from the beginning to linger for too long on emotional pauses is becoming an overwhelming characteristic, turning drama into melodrama. The acting, design and overall production is excellent and I welcome the at least partial return of individual stories for each episode which I'm sure will make the series much more enjoyable for the casual viewer.",7 March 2022
"I almost passed on this show because of the numerous critiques of so-called trekkies who rated this series at 1 star... 1 star???? How?? How???????? Your not a sci-fi addict nor a trekkie if you rated this show at 1 star. And I can't say all I want to say because my review would not be publishable.

So I'm giving it a 10 to be as extreme as these so called trekkies. 1 star.... What the....??

I can accept that people have different opinions. I can accept some will not like it. But if you can't be objective, what's the point. 1 star.... Wow...

I've been a fan since TOS, TNG, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise... and now Discovery. It's good sci fi. I loved them all for what they brought to sci fi and to the universe. They were all different. I still watch TNG episodes and I also watch Discovery. I can't begin to understand what these so called critiques are talking about.

It's sci fi... It's entertainment... It's FICTION. Get it?? F-I-C-T-I-O-N!! If you can't enjoy this show, stop calling yourself a trekkie. Yes they changed things. OMG!!!!! O-M-G!!!!!! If you can't get over this, you don't have a very good imagination...

Season two is just phenomenal. Keep it up, we love it, we want more, and I simply can't wait for season 3.

If like me you hesitate, don't. Watch it... It's good.",23 April 2019
"I am a lifelong trekker. I would say my favorites outside of original series are Next Generation and DS9. I actually like this one a bit more than Voyager. That female lead series came out when fewer misogynist trolls festered. Now we have another stronger color-diverse female lead series with same sex relationships to boot which is great, however the writing and dialogue are lacking as I thought was lacking in Voyager. Still I watched the entire first season and enjoyed the basic story line and plot twists, a couple of which caught me by surprise. But I think I am disappointed in the war theme throughout with less emphasis on discovery (the ship name for goodness sake). Sure there are scientific plot holes the size of a red dwarf but that is the nature of most scifi. I look forward to Picard being a true continuation in the Star Trek tradition. In the meantime this series isn't bad. Oh, can I state a pet peeve please? If Firefly could do a series with no friggin engine or explosion noises in the vacuum of space, can't Star Trek do that for once??",5 December 2019
"It's not until I watched Star Trek strange new world that I realised just how bad the last season (season 4) was. Don't get me wrong the first 3 seasons were watchable but in the end I got sick of the constant crying and whispering and people talking more about how they feel than actually doing anything. The more characters they have introduced the more annoying they are, the ""Adira & gray"" characters made me want the Borg to turn up and assimilate them and the fact they have no no strait white men anywhere makes me think there must have been some secret space plague that wiped them all out. I feel the only way to save this show is to wipe the whole cast out and start again!",21 May 2022
Stop your whining - series 1 and 2 drove me mad but this is starting to feel like the old Star Trek with episodes only loosely tied to a broader story arc. Much better so far.,21 November 2020
"I'm 4 episodes into Star Trek Discovery... Love the visuals, it's Star Trek, but with more of the look and feel of the new movies than the old TV series... More action, really beautiful visuals and cinematography, and a story arc that's a little darker, has a bit more edge and suspense... Even if it doesn't 100% jive with everything from the older shows - TNG, DS9, Voyager, etc., I think the show is what it needs to be... There's suspense where you need to see the next episode, where you really don't know what will happen next.

This is not TNG, I loved Star Trek TNG, its quirkiness and lovable characters... nothing takes away from that, but that's a show from a different era TBH... Discovery feels fresh and interesting, has enough edge and amazing art and visuals to keep it interesting in our current age of television, with all of the other amazing shows out there... I'm excited to see where this goes!",15 October 2017
"I see the gamer boys have done their duty and tried to pull down the ratings on Discovery. Ignore the Incels and gamers threatened by a show lead by strong women and the whiners of ""too PC"" and ""SJW"" detritus. (Why do these people EVER watch any Star Trek? Equality and empowerment have been the shows hallmark since the beginning-even when inaptly pulled off due to the social mores of the era).

Discovery is exciting, heartfelt, gorgeous to look at. Probably the most solid acting in a series yet. Look I have watched, read and breathed Star Trek for 50 years and this is a beautiful addition to the franchise. I cannot wait for season two.",13 January 2019

Also I hated what J J Adrams did; destroy Vulcan and Romulus, so any fidelity to a so called cannon I can do without. Anal Trekies please do grow up and stop trying to destroy an entertaining series that could go from strength to strength- you'll miss it when it's gone!",9 October 2017
"Purists will have a good time, as do old trekkers. New viewers will discover a nice and tense show, glowing in the midst of unknown space and time. The epic tone in which DSC chose to start can only be held if next episodes writing will be as good (and even better) than these two. Discovery is neither a ""next"" series nor a Star Trek reboot. Lives on its own.

Abandon all fears those who were bracing for a JJ impact. Mr Kurtzman and his crew got what was wrong with the ""new"" movies. Also, those who wanted a Star Trek Ongoing Classic, part XXI, there are plenty of enjoyable and good quality fan-made shows. This is not it.

Discovery has the edge of the original Star Trek in its own time and era. We are in 2017. We are different people and different minds. We have engaged the future and it's not as bright as Gene could have imagined it in the 60s. That is why Discovery is so close to the Original Series as it can. It's a punch, a kick, an alert, an amazing art show and a complex narrative.

This is not good vs bad, as in so many series. This is, almost, real life. And, as in real life, things get messy and dark. In a way, Discovery is wrong to be opening in 2017. It's almost 17 years late. We should have known these and this back in September 1, 2001. We could have. We didn't care about Sci-Fi back then.

Now, it's up to writers and producers to amaze us or delude our good faith in wonderful sci-fi. The first two episodes pushed as far as we wanted, just to get to the edge. Let's jump out and see what's out there. As in 1966. Or else",25 September 2017
"Look I'll be honest. Why must every moment have a sense of emotional relief with tons of tears. Also, thanks for constantly reminding me how great the same gender love is. It's boring.

This PC rubbish is just terrible. After season 2 the show went downhill fast. Now in season 4 I can't even bare watching it anymore. Emo characters and political agendas. The only positive about the series are the good production values. As usual for Trek series those are great.,23 December 2021
"I am a Star Trek fan through and through and Discovery is no exception, From the talented cast to the developing story line this show is excellent... Sonequa Martin-Green and Michelle Yeoh are top notch leads for the show... Please keep Discovery running...",19 April 2019
"I really liked Season 1 & 2, due to its light-hearted, well-mixed incorporation of science, discovery, and action. I remembered there were episodes that talked merely about simple topics of love or integrity, and they wrote it in a brilliant and tender way that really resonated with me. I hadn't watched any Star Trek series before, and I know many fans disagree, but this series is meant to be independent of the main series. As a ""newbie"", I liked what they are building and how it leaves room for growth. However, I must say season 3 is pretty disappointing and they've kind of lost it. It felt like going sideways without the spirits as it had been having, and I felt bored trying to finish the season. The feelings and exploration of characters were pretty forced and to be honest... lame. (Did they change the writers? I can't tell). Really hope things would change for the better in forthcoming seasons, if there'll ever be. Also, I think they have announced there's a new separate series for Enterprise, which could be nice. I'll look forward to it if this show's off.",30 March 2021
"Discovery is very much the weakest of all the Star Trek series, and I think that's because it's built on very shaky foundations. It was billed as a ""lower decks"" show but ended up being entirely shaped around one crew member who could basically override anyone and anything. The likable surrounding characters rarely got a look in and even the universe itself could bend to whatever Michael's plotline happen to be. It was hard to like and even blasting far into the future couldn't shed all the show's baggage. However it has gingerly begun to finally find itself an identity in its fourth season after they finally dropped the core pretence and made Michael captain the show actually started to get a lot stronger. It's a clunky and painfully earnest kind of Trek, but there is some unmatched representation, some really adorable supporting folk in the mix and some really stunning effects which makes it watchable. Discovery may have, at long last, finally discovered itself.",9 July 2020
"Ok so not the hugest TOS fan, more of a TNG or VOYAGER guy but this is so FUN! It's emotive and gritty but still celebrates the beauty that G. R loved so much in so far as the peaceful values he tried to represent in the Federation. It allows me to fantasise about a future where mankind isn't garbage.",4 July 2021
"What a ride, I agree with some hardcore trekkies here that season one of Discovery didn't create that feeling of trek that we were looking for, it's a different story now with season two, wow what an impressive change, this TV series is screaming Star Trek, its way better than Enterprise, I'm happy for this change in direction and every episode is raising the bar higher and higher, Engage!!",1 March 2019
"It would appear to me that the majority of 1 and 2 Star reviews on IMDB are from middle aged white guys who like their Sevens and Troi as eye candy, their POC characters in the background for the most part, and their captains stoic and logical.

Discovery is exactly the opposite. We've got Queer, Non-Binary and Gay actors and characters and 2 leads who are Black.

It's now, by S2, set 1000-odd years in the future where the Producers assume that acceptance is the norm and anybody can be anything they want to be regardless of gender, skin colour etc.

It's called Discovery for a reason. Not only is it about the general Star Trek mantra of ""exploring strange new worlds"" but also about humanity exploring is own newfound levels of acceptance of everyone in a futuristic society that is even more all-encompassing than society in TNG, DS9 et al.

It's not ""woke"" - it's progressive and I love it for that.",27 June 2022
"To be fair, it ain't tng, ds9 or the original series. Each series mentioned there was great but flawed in it's own way. What they dis however was grow into their own skin.

First series is a bit hmmmm but we are trying to create a legend and you can never know what will work until the masses view it.

I do like series 2 so far. We will see were it goes but I urge you all; watch; view; comment and hopefully build a better star trek.

Hoping that this will get a good run and that it will grow as the fans want over time.

In summary, give it a chance to find it's feet and blossom into something beautiful.",23 February 2019
"TNG and DS9 hold the bar for what Star Trek should be - philosophically inspiring explorations into a possible future we can all aspire to, even in the midst of intergalactic war. Discovery seasons 1 and 2 is an insult to their legacy.

Season 1 is a tired, dumbed down, shoot them up, mumble jumble of betrayals and double betrayals. A couple of great ideas like the mycelial network and alternate dimensions were explored, but we were only treated to superficial whip cream, not the sundae.

Klingons degenerated into barely comprehensible villains who have to spit out every word. Their bleached skin, one-dimensional characters have no redeemable value. I miss the warrior race bound by ritual and honor we both loved and hated in past incarnations. The female empowerment clap trap was not consistent with their misogynistic culture and seemed slapped on like a dead fish.

Season 2 held promise until episode 7. New Eden almost transported me back to the TNG days. As soon as Spock joined the plot, the story became grade school and every character's IQ dropped below 90. The last episode of Season 2 redeemed it a bit, but not enough.

Don't trust the studio hacked ratings. No Trekkie would rate this over 5 stars. Netflix needs to stop paying for the international rights as it is simply rewarding bad behavior.

I took a chance on season 3, set 900 years in the future. It made a genuine effort to restore the wonder of possibilities with future technology. Characters have found heart and face classic TNG level moral conflicts in the disintegrated Federation. It is worth a watch despite the sappy tear-filled plots. I hope the writers continue down this path but make the characters even more mature for season 4.",24 August 2019
"I Hate all of you for not giving this show a higher rating. as star trek fans we need to ban together, and support this series . if we don't support this series, people will not be enthused to sign up to make more star trek, as it always get's MAJOR back lash from you emos. Thanks director's for directing this season, and please continue to wright more str trek for us. also, to all of you emo old cannon or bust losers, get your eyes on this, or you won't be getting anything elt's as star trek will be considered as a failed franchise, where no fans support there series and movies. if we don't get this to 7 seasons, we will never get new content. I AM A HUGE KIRK SERIES FAN (JANEWAY, SISKO, PICARD, ECT), SO I KNOW THHE importance OF CONTENT SUPPORT. IF THIS IS ANOTHER ENTERPRISE, WE WILL NEVER GET NEW SERIES.",17 April 2019
Just wondering... Mary Wiseman is out of faze with Star Trek and she don't belongs in this series. Am I right?,14 December 2019
Now the shows' writers rather make a show about a toilet clogged with many feces making it unflushable and smelly. Burnham is not a good plumber! Too disappointed but predictable.,2 December 2021
"A baddy with a sense of humour. Best character/actress on this show. Needs more screen time and a bigger role. First time I saw her I thought ""God she looks like Margot Kidder"". Well duh, she's her niece. I just thought she was really good in this and funny. I'm biased because I know she's a fellow Canadian. Good on her. Her aunt would be proud. My rating is for her, not the show.",5 January 2021
"I have watched all episodes of all Star Trek series except for DS9.

And I love this show. I am so glad that it got made.

This show has all the best features of trek, the adventure, the grandeur, the science, exploration, etc. But it also has an amazing storyline.

Both seasons were good and but season 2 is even better!",8 March 2019
"This isn't your old Star Trek. Some Trek pursits will be stunned at the flawed nature of some of the major characters. As a long time Star Trek watcher, I find the change was much needed in the franchise. Most of the eposodes in the first year were quite good (there were a couple of weak areas). I am surprized at the many one star written reviews. Don't let the negative reviews get you down. The one star reviews are silly and I don't really get what their problem is with the series.",17 March 2018
"Trying really hard not to be bias here because I see the sheer potential in this show and want it to do well. The first half of the first series was a bit of a mess. It lacked identity and wasn't sure what direction it wanted to go. The season improved dramatically after the mid season interval. It seems this season (Season 2) they've wiped the slate clean and are starting again from scratch and so far it seems to be working. Visuals are excellent, characters are likeable (besides Burnham) stories improve as the season goes on. Definitely worth sticking with because the first few episodes are hard to bear. Also, all the people review bombing and giving it stick. Remember the last time this happened? A star trek show with a shaky start got cancelled just as it came into it's own and we went without trek on tv for 12 years.",28 January 2019
"Wow just finally watched the end of season 2

It was absolutely amazing!!

Ignore the naysayers there is never going to be a tv series that everybody loves...

But this show is one of the best out there 🙌",4 August 2019
"Man this season flew off the rails and stayed there. Barely watchable. Space battles, getting shot at and the crew has these permanent perma smiles...smh. Captain Picard to the bridge!",17 March 2022
"Welcome to the cozy world of sci-fi for women. Radiation is just sunburn in this world and somehow things make a lot of noise in outer space!

Yes, girls... if you like the Lifetime Channel and feminist fantasy cartoons then you've been waiting for this awful drivel all your lives.

Ultra annoying feminist Yoko Ono gets a spaceship and giggles her way through some appalling stories about the ugly Klingons, who in this series look like black slugs!

This isn't a show for heterosexual men and if you are paying for this wretched space-junk then you're in for more than your share of disappointment.

The first episode has some novelty value so I made it through the entire 42 minutes without stabbing my eyes out, but episode two is just unwatchable. The characters were created by the worst performers in a gender studies love-fest and are unlikeable and do stupid things.

This foul excuse for TV is just another wretched stain that tarnishes the legacy of the original series made in the 1960s. It's disgraceful and offensive in every way to anyone who enjoyed the original series.",26 September 2017
"Full disclosure, I'm a trekkie. I've been watching star trek since I was a kid. One of my earliest memories is of watching TNG with my grand parents.

This might not be star trek as you remember it, it has been 15 years almost and thats if you count ENT. There are a lot of people going mental about what ultimately is minor.

Do you want a new show or do you want some new seasons of deep space nine? That may be a bad example, I would also love some new episodes of ds9...

It took me a few attempts to get into it, I also didnt like it at first. But after giving DIS a chance it's actually pretty good and let's not forget it's barely even into season two. Its almost a rule that the first 2 seasons of a star trek series will be pretty lackluster while they figure it out.

Its encouraging that they seem to be listening to the fans. Lets hope they bring in Jeffrey Combs or Marc Alaimo. Season 2 is already shaping up to be better than the first and the first wasnt too shabby.

I'm not on board with the klingons, they're orks now but whatever, we're finally getting some new trek and they do seem to be trying to get it right.

8/10, I gave an extra star because all the negative reviews arent fair",28 February 2019
"I always liked the franchise and watched all of the shows, some of the seasons even many times. I loved it. But the universe was getting to bloated up with the lore, sometimes you were even needing Wikipedia to keep up and the last shows were only so- so. I'm glad it's going back to the beginnings where the world was more simple and the conflict with the Klingons was the main arc. Sure, it's changing a lot of things, but not more than were changed between TOS and TNG. I see a lot of people complaining that it's turning into dirty SF, but well, the ST Universe was always dirty. Yeah sure, not the Enterprise but everything around her. Other ship crews and captains, admirals, Federation citizens. There was a lot of conflict and evil all around. Just the Enterprise crew was kind of perfect, noble and utopian. I loved TNG for this. But it was getting old with all the Trek shows doing the same thing. This time it's more like a modern TOS, but without the hippie-lights and cardboard walls all around.

I'm just afraid it won't run for long. It seems to be still too niche to be a mainstream hit but at the same time not accurate enough for the hardcore-fanbase. And it looks like production costs a lot of money, so it probably won't survive with a viewer base that is somewhere in between.",13 November 2017
"Just finished the first 2 episodes, and what a brilliant pilot to the new Trek series!

So far it's shown the consequences of what happens when your typical protagonist plot lines don't quite work out as planned... and it's more believable and compelling because of it!

Having watched every other bit of trek out there, this is something new and exciting, but with plenty that connects it to everything that has come before it.

Updated style, accurate social/political reflection (almost the main aim of Star Trek), tech in line our projected advancement, interesting characters with plenty of room for development (at least the ones that have survived...), cool new outfits... and free on Netflix!",25 September 2017
"I found it watchable, enjoyable and semi binge worthy, but the lead actress for me was terrible. Everything was fine until she was in the scenes. Many other actors in the cast had superior talent. Glad there is a modernised Star Trek series and would be interested in a future one too, just cut the cheese out and the bad acting that's not even quirky.",9 March 2021
"Season one is SO AWFUL!!! The story (what little there is) is important, though. Fight your way through season one, and it'll be worth it! Humor, character development, and even some joy are introduced little by little after the start of season 2. It actually becomes an amazing addition to the star trek canon. It still drags out emotional scenes, of which there are many, but that's balanced by a broader array of much needed fun.",11 August 2021
"Season 3 is a horrible soap opera. we came to see Star Trek, not a drama with 80% of each episode is crying and emotions. really bad.. seasons 1+2: 10, 3: 2",2 January 2021
"Some casting mistakes. Thank goodness most of the lead characters are strong. Way too much ""painful bureaucracy"" plot twists. Even among the Klingons! Enough already. Meanwhile, they appear to have reworked the Elephant Man headpiece for Kol. The Klingon women all look like Atevi from the covers of CJ Cherryh books.

Fingers crossed",11 August 2019
"Back in 2017, ST: Discovery started out with great promise. The producers then decided to effectively remove all the most interesting characters and send the ship 900 years into the future. Bad move on so many levels.

Season 4 has seen the show plummet to the depths. What made previous ST shows so good was the episodic nature of the series. Each show was a self-contained story with a few longer arcs in the background. Discovery has abandoned that formula and inflicted upon us a dirge of a season, with an utterly tedious long story and, frankly, childishly presented politics shoved down our throats.

The inventiveness, subtlety and good humour has vanished. It's not the actors fault, it's the writers and producers. Frankly, they should quit before they further tarnish the franchise.

We have Strange New Worlds to look forward to and I hope they don't destroy that in the same way.",18 March 2022
Please do not ever stop making this. Such a breath of fresh air from the typical star trek plot.,4 March 2019
"As a casual star trek fan I thoroughly enjoyed this show. Ignore all the negative, star trek fan boy reviews. At its absolute worst, this show is maybe a 6.5/10. At its absolute best, about an 8.5/10. For me personally it's a 7.5. Discovery isn't perfect, but the acting is on point, the costume design is great, the show is not predictable, and the special effects are hands down the best out of any sci fi show to date. A few annoying things happen, that stop it from being scored higher. But does Discovery deserve any of the low scores its gotten? Hell no. A lot of effort has gone into the show, and it clearly has a high budget. Yes it has its flaws, and there are 1 or 2 characters I don't like. But at the end of the day, if you love sci fi. This is a must watch. The only people hating on this show, are star trek freaks getting triggered, because it isn't 100% perfect, lol",13 September 2019
"To me, Discovery is the best Star Trek Series ever.

I grew up watching the first ever series on a small black and white TV as a small kid and devoured Star Trek movies and series ever since.

This series now has an intensity and detail I have not seen before and I particularly like the close look at the Klingon word, culture, religion etc.

I like the acting, the storyline, the tight script; so the bottom line for me is: Simply the best. If there were 12 stars available, I would give them all for this rating.

Well done and prosper for many series to come!",5 February 2019
"I have watched 9 episodes now and have enjoyed the series so far. I like the idea of the overarching story line running through the series and I find the story of the female lead interesting and different. I am not a die hard star trek fan, just a normal viewer who likes a range of different genres. Worth a look.",14 November 2017
"The hypocrisy in the fandom is toxic and seering, because had networks listened to the fans for the first run of those two series there wouldnt have been much of a show to idolize. Now that being said I love Discovery. I love that they're taking risks with the material AND i'll give it a few more seasons to find its barings. Something you'd think ST fans would have learned by now. An englishman with a bald head, jumpsuits, and a ""soap opera"" on stationary ship with a ""PC black captain"" eventually won us over .. Who knows where this goes as well",7 February 2019
"I'm not surprised that this show is garnering such extreme reactions - although what doesn't these days - but I rather like it.

Let's be clear, this show is all over the place in terms of story. It seems to be changing direction all the time and there are plot developments that seem far-fetched to say the least. However, there is a clear sense of purpose and at those moments when the plot elements click into place, the show is quite satisfying.

There is a strong sense that the makers are trying to reinvent Star Trek. Discovery pushes diversity more strongly than any other Star Trek (although the idea that it beats down on ""straight white men"", as some reviewers suggest, is silly to me). It infuses the series with a strong dose of action, not unlike the new films. It plays around with certain established conventions (like the Klingons). To name a few things....

All of this is inevitably going to upset some viewers. However, I also detect a palpable love of Star trek at the core of this new version. In fact, despite the flash of it all, this feels much more like Star Trek than the new films. Maybe it's the way it embraces exciting ideas, about identity, culture, war, biology. Admittedly, the way it explores these ideas is much more implicit (and sometimes rushed) than previous incarnations might have, but that does not make it any less fascinating.

What else can I say. This show isn't perfect, but it feels fresh, the acting is pretty solid and it looks good.",2 April 2018
Extraordinarily ordinary and boring characters Bla Bla Bla Bla Bla banging on and on in terribly worthy and self important tones about absolutely nothing for hours and hours. Episodes that don't know how to end with a score that seems to build to an emotional climax a million times and the crying... oh dear god the crying. So much crying. Just... stop. Please stop. Never before have I wished so hard for the Borg to show up and assimilate the entire cast just so they'll stop... talking!,2 December 2020
"After reading page upon page of horrible reviews I decided to throw my 2 cents in. I am really enjoying this new installment.

I am and always have been a massive star trek fan. But to be honest I'm sick of the same old wash rince repeat that all the latest star trek series have been. I also have a feeling these are the same people who criticized the reboots, which in my opinion are far superior to TOS movies.

This has an extremely fresh take on the series and makes you feel like it is based on real life, the characters are complicated and the federation aren't the A typical good guys. There is conflict between crew members, just like there is conflict in any workplace.

Star Trek from the beginning has dared to be different and touched on current events (the first interracial kiss) and this series seems to be living up to the original (first time I heard a star fleet member swear)

I truly believe Mr.Roddenberry would approve of this series, especially in this day and age.

And to anyone who compares it to TNG or DS9, it's not trying to be. So if you truly love Star Trek and sci fi give this gem a watch.",9 November 2017
"For those complaining about Star Trek being too PC and making social commentary...this is what Star Trek and all sci-fi has always been about. This genre has always used the setting of a future time or an alien world, as well as an audience limited to very open minded science and fantasy oriented people to have the freedom to say things that could not be otherwise said. Because Star Trek is mainstream we get the oppressive judgments that come with the larger audience base. For those who do not like this genre- you are always free to just stop watching, otherwise I really don't care about your fragility towards seeing women and people of color taking the lead for once. Gene Roddenberry himself created this story about ""cowboys in outer space"" set so far into the future that a black female officer didn't seem strange or out of place, as well as other social commentaries and statements about our current human condition that could not otherwise be made and accepted by the general audience.

This show will take you out of your time and place, where many things are very different from what we are used to. Do not be so judgmental, just sit back and enjoy the ride. Women need to relate to male protagonists all the time to be able to enjoy good art and yet you don't hear us complaining nearly so much about it despite our being a majority of the population.",24 September 2017
"After 2 seasons I didn't think it could get anymore woke but it did. Its a shame as the CGI is brilliant and the story is not too bad. It's just the feeling the ""message"" is more important than the programme.",29 May 2021
S3 feels like they are acting at being 'Killjoys' or 'Dark Matter'. Indefensible garbage.,17 October 2020
"I was 10 when Kirk first appeared on my TV and I have loved each new reincarnation of Star Trek since, but this one surpasses them all, It has evolved into a wonderfully thoughtful, emotional, inclusive show.

I think Gene Roddenberry would be very pleased.

Thank you everyone involved for giving me some of the best TV enjoyment to date.",21 November 2020
"I followed the Star Trek universe since Captain Jean-Luc Picard's TNG. This new Star Trek series is amazing too and I can recommend it to those who like science fiction TV shows. For those who really wanted a TV show that is similar to the ""old"" Star Trek, you will find yourself having a hard time.

If you are looking for an amazing science fiction TV show. I can recommend Star Trek Discovery. If you look for a reboot similar to Star Trek TOS, then I am sorry this show is not for you. The universe is the same but that's all. Acting, dialogue, action are in a faster pace and the appearances changed though retaining some similarities.

It uses the same concept as Game of Thrones and the Walking Dead (and probable more TV shows). In general the majority of people are not really into dragons and zombies however good dialogue and interesting cliffhangers keeps the crowd hooked for the next episode and TV show.

I give the rating a 7/10 so far based on the first four episodes I have seen. The 10/10 rating is to off-set against the negative ratings purely because of comparing this TV Show with the old Star Trek, even up to Star Trek TOS back in 1966. Please grow up, we live in 2017 now, TV land has changed, different requirements, needs etc.",23 October 2017
After first season I was somehow skeptical as there were some inconsistencies regarding the Star Wars Universe. Anyway I am positively surprised by the second season as they encountered an elegant way of correcting these inconsistencies and also made a very thrilling story. It is somehow a really accelerated Star Trek with a convincing Captain Pike and also adding personal stories of the key personnel instead of a 100% fixation like in first season. As a very traditional Star Trekker I am far more than pleased by second season. For sure there are still details to be discussed but probably also this is something good! I am thrilled to see third season !,22 April 2019
"I liked it. Had a feeling of being more ..""out there""...rather than Americans in space trying to tell the universe how to exist. (seriously..what would they know) Similar to The Expanse in style.

Interesting storyline. it needs growth. But that usually happens with time. Felt like I was watching a movie not a bad feeling. This is definitely geared to high definition TV. So visually stunning. Can't hide much with a 4k TV.

Going to love the reaction of the Klingon fans. They are not going to like the new look. No long hair, no boots with hooks. They are not going to be impressed...hmmm.. I wonder how blue the Andorians are going to Look?",26 September 2017
"I'd like to preface this by stating that you can't ever please Star Trek fans. I've been both a Star Trek fan and a Star Wars fan for the majority of my life. Star Trek fans are the worst.... the absolute worst when it comes to nitpicking things. They are obnoxious to a level that Star Wars fans can only dream of becoming. The reviews of the show on this site are a pretty good indicator of that. Klingons don't look right.... 1/10. The ears don't look right... 2/10. No show will ever be the Star Trek that you grew up loving. The original series was made for the 60s... TNG was made for the late to early 90s. Things evolve... get over it.

The show does many things well... has complex characters, an intricate story.. and is never short of action. The show has a similar tone to that of the JJ Abrams incarnations of Star Trek, yet has a more detached cerebral quality to it. Is it perfect, no. It is pretty darn good though.",4 October 2017
"It isn't all that bad, but people obsessed with canon may not be happy. Some people have noted that the average rating is better that the negative reviews would suggest. It seems that people with negative opinions are more likely to post reviews. The top rated show Earth II has only 99 reviews, but this has nearly nearly two and a half thousand.",2 September 2019

"Every time an episode drops, I find myself wishing thing this was on a platform that broadcasts all of the episodes at once so it can be binge watched. It was hilarious when the trance worm barfed Michael Burnham in S03E01. Anyway, this show is really worth watching.",23 October 2020
"I'll be honest - I was never a huge fan of the Star Trek series. Star Trek Voyage aired when I was just a little kid and I never really got ""into"" it, though I do remember watching the occasional episode and enjoying it. As an adult, I've tried getting into the Star Trek series once more, since I understand it's an epic tale - the enormous fandom speaks for itself. I do find the Star Trek Voyage series engaging. I've never watched the original series. Therefore, I can't exactly call myself a ""trekkie"", only a moderate fan.

Which is why I was so pleasanty surprised by Bryan Fuller's Star Trek Discovery series. I wasn't looking for anything special - just something to watch on a Friday night, you know? Wasn't expecting anything amazing, just something interesting enough to pass the time. 5 minutes into the pilot episode, I was hooked. I'm not going to go out of my way and claim that this series is a masterpiece or anything - there are far better TV shows out there, but if we just look at it for what it is: a sci-fi adventure series, based on an already established tale, re-imagined and updated, you might find yourself enjoying it.

Personally, I love how the series is making me feel nostalgic, while at the same time presenting a brand new adventure to me. Interesting, fun new characters - plenty of strong females. Exhilirating battles right from the get-go, beutiful shots of space, gorgeous special effects (for a TV series).

As someone who's always been mildly interested in Star Trek but lacked the patience/time/energy to watch the previous series, I'm very excited about Discovery. But I will say that I think this series is perhaps better suited for those who haven't watched Star Trek before: newbies. Star Trel veterans might feel turned off, as I'm sure this new series differs a lot from its' predecessors. It may be easier to enjoy this if you don't have anything to compare it to. Just saying. :) In any case, I give this series a solid 9! It's imaginative, titilating, updated and full of action - while still maintaining the kind of heart-warming wholesomeness that reminds me of the episodes I watched as a child. The cast is absolutely fine in my opinion - not perfect, but totally fine. ^^",19 January 2018
"Thanks to a friend of mine, I binged season 1 on dvd. With all of the licensing issues that Paramount has between television and movies, as well as the denials from those at CBS. This is without a doubt, a prequel to the movies in the Kelvin Universe. This has absolutely no relationship with the Prime Universe. If you can get past that then you will enjoy this series more. With that being said. It took a while for the show to get some traction. A lot of the scenes in the pilot seemed very rushed and fragmented. It took until the third episode for the cast to begin to mesh. I can appreciate the re imagining of the ships and the make up department. Overall I like the show, but i""m still not going to pay for it. Will either wait for someone to lend me season 2 or pay for one month and binge, then cancel my subscription.",21 January 2019
"I have been a Star Trek fan for over 40 years and acutely felt the void left after Voyager ended, like many. Initially feeling conflicted over the movie reboot I've grown to like them as a badly needed update for the new millennium. Nonetheless, a TV series was still missing. I feel this has been rectified with ST: Discovery.

It doesn't feel like ST of old and it shouldn't it needs to compete with other sci-fi series available and it needs to speak to a new and younger generation with more expectations in terms of special fx and cgi. Discovery delivers. It also greatly promises to deliver on character and story development.

I fondly remember ST TNG, DS 9 and Voyager but rewatching episodes can feel a bit dated. And repetitive. I hope the creators will keep up the fast pace set in the first two episodes and hopefully all of us as Star Trek fans will support this show.",25 September 2017
"Seasons 1&2 were great and the interconnection with the original trek characters n timeline was mastery. Season 3 fell away badly after the teran episodes and the burn ended up very lame. Either go back in time and hook up with pike n spok and draw on them, perhaps introduce a younger Kirk... or if embrace concepts from the org trek going forward will be tough cos the current crew are very lame and too politically correct...",29 January 2021
"Since the horrible J. J. Abrams mangling of Star Trek, we are forced to watch a Trek that goes nowhere. Discovery is a waste of time because no character is compelling. Do we care about the characters? No.

No mission is important or a nail-biting adventure. The scripts are filled with superfluous dialogue that reads like the interactions on a daytime soap opera. The stories do not advance. The climax is boring with unnecessary and unimportant resolution that requires 13 episodes to never give the audience a feeling of satisfaction. There is no chemistry, no personal growth for the characters. For a limited series, there are too many episodes that are filler episodes-going where no man has gone before, which is nowhere.

The lead is not convincing as a starship captain. She is not tough. She is not smart. She is not tested with a storied history. Emotion and 10-minute discussions about nonsensical feelings dominate this show, as well as, too many damned hugs. I hate this show because it continues to dismantle the guts of Trek established by TOS, TNG and DS9. Whether episodic- or serial-based series, these shows defined the compassion, humanity and relevance that made Trek important. I cared about those characters.

While the special effects are without flaw in DSC, the saying goes that you cannot polish a turd.",17 March 2022
"I am not an eloquent reviewer in any form of viewer reviews anywhere but I just want to share my personal insights of my favorite TV Series right now, Star Trek Discovery. I am an avid fan of Game of Thrones and because as we all know, we all have to wait a very long time before the last season begin airing again, we have to look for other good shows that will keep us entertained. I found such a show with Star Trek Discovery.

I must say every episode is like watching a full featured film movie. It is expected that not all episodes are thrilling but the episodes keep getting better and better as it nears its final episode of its season.

"I am at season four now - and i have to reaaally force myself trying to watch it. It's so bad. Sooo bad.

"Ignore the naysayers and recent low ratings. If you enjoy great characters, interesting science fiction and gripping action this is the series for you. If you're unreasonably attached to former series in the Star Trek universe you may have issues with it. Discovery does not have that optimistic, cheery Roddenberry glow. This is gritty, dark material but for my money it's the best series since the original. It challenges the viewer the way the themes and plots of the first series did, but in different ways.

Season 1 was uneven but promising. Season 2 has been nothing but astounding. I don't want to give anything away so if you loved the 60's show, check out what happens prior to it via Discovery but don't get hung up on the advanced science and improved effects. Just enjoy the ride!",25 March 2019
"Hello Readers,

I read all of the reviews about how Star Trek Discovery isn't Star Trek; that it's too dark; that there are no likable characters; that it's not philosophical; etc. as the reasons to loathe it. However, are Star Trek fans just unwilling to embrace a different type of Star Trek? Can they not adapt and change to differing generational takes on it?

Discovery isn't actually that bad as a Star Trek series:

>Explores the darker side of the universe like J.J. Abram's Star Trek movie: I never liked how Star Trek wasn't willing to explore the darker sides on the other series in the franchise.

>The series is finally exploring new worlds, not pigeonholed into the stereotypical species that they stayed with throughout the Next Generation and Deep Space Nine: It's refreshing to return back to Star Trek roots of exploration and discovering new worlds.

>There are likable characters for me: Saru, for one: He has an interesting species; Tilly: She is a refreshing air for the darkness integrated into the series; Tyler: Interesting to explore the genetic aspects of the character; and so forth.

I do wish that they would focus on other characters more, which I believe they are with the last episode strongly focused on Saru.

>People complain about the technology is too advance for the time-era: There was advanced technology in the Original Series which never made it into the Next Generation Series; it seems intuitive that, while technology doesn't exist in the future, it could have been used and got lost or destroyed, or deemed classified and too dangerous to be used: Time-travel can even be used to explain why the technology never made it into the future, which will probably be the case.

>I got tired of all the reused material of the other Star Trek series, in some ways; they just redid plots already used in different ways: It gets old after a while... At least, Discovery is willing to break the rehashed plots and try to adventure into new plots. It will be interesting to see where it goes and hope they don't start conforming to the fans, entirely.

>The series seems to be working in more philosophical problems into the series, and I'm sure they will do more so in the future.

All in all, I hope that the Series keeps improving into the future; it's like a cross between Farscape and Star Trek for me, in a way. No one wants to give new series a chance anymore and it takes at least 3 series before a series gets it's standing.

The series isn't perfect, but it has a lot of good possibilities if it doesn't go with the majority vote into which direction it should take.

Take Care, With Love Through God and Jesus and The Holy Ghost,",7 March 2019
It doesn't rival any star trek shows and movies first of all the ship doesn't exist in the star trek timeline no mention of it no mention of captain Burnham I may argue it was erased but too much emotion great finales but too much soap.,6 April 2021
"The issue with many peoples 1 star is that they expected Discovery to be about outside discovery, However, it is about the ship called Discovery, and tells the story about the crew. It is one of the most visually stunning and action packed series ever. I hate one fact about it, and that is the constant crying they put in the show. They can convey pain, sorrow, and hurt without it, but such is the way of all shows these days. It is not truly part of the old franchise, but if you think of Deep Space Nine which never really was about discovering. Then you can understand that this series is about the ship and all who is on it. Do not go in expecting to be discovering new worlds, etc. Just watch it from a perspective of learning about the crew, LGBT, aliens, cybernetics, and more.",20 January 2021
"Guys i don't see your points. You even tell it's a horrible series, but it is not (watch series like star wars clonewars and you will know what is horrible). Consider, that the good old star trek can't survive in our time, people (me included) want a good story, action and fun even when i watch a single episode. Discovery gives me the feeling, to be a part of the new, modern star trek. Just to rate it wiht one star is pretty stupid of you, because you even see the bad points of the series. Don't destroy the new beginning and let discovery get 7 seasons!",31 January 2018
"Shocking how off key and out of tune this Star Trek series is. Season 4 seems to have made no improvements. Star Trek officers moonbeam smiling at one another for little or no reason. Then disaster and conflict followed with lessons learned and feelings felt. Big mysterious mysteries. All I know for sure is that more moonbeam smiles are ahead what I don't know is if I will be there to see.

"This is more in line with the recent reboot films. Good cast, good effects, great action. I'm not a trekky but this is a star trek series that I can watch. I can see why the hardcore might not like it; every other series seemed to consist of hours and hours of plodding through space meeting people wearing dodgy rubber masks, occasionally meeting people in period drama wardrobe (possibly recycled from an old film or closed down theatre) and nearly always procrastinating nonstop about what it means to be human (yawn). This got straight into two strong (non white) female lead characters who carried the sci fi and action really well. What a refreshing change and I'm look forward to watching the rest of the series.",25 September 2017
"Trekkies are loyal and patient. But they're not stupid.

After watching the frustrating first two seasons of this show, I couldn't help thinking: damn, they're going to pull another ""LOST"" on us.

But, the story line was just part of the frustration and it was amplified by many other issues that is the core of many negative review here.

Frankly, it would have been fine with me if they had cancelled the show, hoping that by cancelling the show, it would let Gene Roddenberry's soul rest in peace. .

HOWEVER,

After two seasons of nonsensical story line mayhem, it looks like this show FINALLY may have found a story line that it can meaningfully develop and hopefully make sense at some point. Just have to skip the first two seasons and consider it a fresh new start..

Lets hope that producers are smart enough not to think that making a good Star Trek series is just based on a dry recipe of contemporary social issues with a pinch of original series reminiscence/characters.

It has to make sense, be faithful to the Star Trek concepts, expand the viewer imagination and have some consistency and continuity.

This review was written after watching the third episode of season 3 and it is still a bit early to say they've finally got it.

Lets keep out fingers crossed.",30 October 2020
"Well, Im glad im not a massive ST fan, cause I really like the show and those doesnt seem to do so. I like all characters and the stories and it seem hella better than Deep space nine (which my partner is currently watching).

People who rate this 1s has clearly never seen a bad show before.. So, dont let them scare you off .",7 November 2020
"The visuals in this production are good, and some good concepts like the mythelian field. But maybe people wouldn't feel so cheated if they had just been truthful and created an entirely new show, rather than labeling it something it's absolutely not just to make money. This is definitely not and kind of Star Trek as we know and love.

The female main character is ridiculously emotional and crying all the time, her over acting is totally nauseating. The entire crew are weak characters that try too hard or are as flat as cardboard.

The reason why traditional Star Trek has always had such an enthusiastic following is because it stands for integrity and optimism, strong yet human people behaving with honor, dedication to learning from and collaborating with new species, interesting stories, and good moral undertones that are not rammed down your throat. This is none of those things, it has nothing of substance.",2 January 2022
"I have been absolutely enthralled with Star Trek Discovery since it first aired. I love the plots, the cinematics, the storytelling, and the heart that goes into each and every episode.

I don't worship at the altar of ""One Tru Trek"" and having read the history about Roddenberry's creation and some of the decisions that were made in regard to earlier franchises such as TOS and TNG, I'm convinced that the ""wagon train to the stars"" actually thrived when taken out of his control.

Discovery, Picard, and SNW, is a feast of the senses and takes Trek where others couldn't. Where some absolutely refused to go. (Except for DS9 which was the best series of them all).

Don't listen to the naysayers on these review pages. They're just mad that it isn't the exact same formula as the older shows with their polyester clothing and hit and miss episodes.

Discovery is the essence of Trek and that is the inclusion of humanity, in all its various glory, to achieve a higher purpose - the ideals of Starfleet.",8 August 2022
"The first episode blow me away, already we see epic clashes, speceffects and well done scenery but the acting is supreme!

Cant be more unsatisfied with the votes of this, because compared to the star trek Picard (2020) , its is star trek with flights and mystery science and action!

I simply cant belive this is so underrated, compared to this Witcher, Picar, is simply trash.",28 March 2020
"I had trouble accepting Discovery at first. I even posted a negative review somewhere but I can't remember where which is frustrating because I want to go back and change it. I was a fool to review a series without watching all available episodes.

A friend encouraged me to keep watching. I did and I love it. The Star Trek elements are there loud and proud. It's well done!",25 February 2020
"I wasnt expecting much and after the first few episodes was ready to jump and abort. However the more I watched the more I realised these characters are not 1 dimentional and theres a lot more going on than a linear run of the mill war. Many characters have their own arc and its not your typical all about the captain Star Trek series. The writing is really good with a good mixture of subtle humor and the more familiar scientific trek talk. Filled with twists, some even i didnt see coming, what started off a bit of a chore turned into a few days binge. Im a trekkie, not hardcore, and really liked Discovery. Cant wait for series 2 !",10 June 2018

Season 2 and 3 seemed to be building, nice plot and engaging (not flying).

But what has happen to season 4??

It seems that now Michael and Co are the netball team of the Federation!

High firing, back slapping, let's hug this out star ship crews, just don't seem to have reality element, that can engage and transpose people from the comfy lockdown suite of our lounge room to the dribble that has become Season 4 of Star Trek Discovery.

"The usual talentless hacks are back with their repurposing of the Star Trek IP, bringing you another big pile of unwatchable grey sludge.

A diverse roster of questionably cast actors, unlikable characters, hammy and often nonsensical dialog, over-the-top special effects, a dumb as dishwater plot and a lack of any kind of heart or soul add Star Trek: Discovery to the endless list of garbage with the name Alex Kurtzman attached to it.

Of course, all those involved in the production of this show are very cozy with the Hollywood media, which is why all their movies and shows consistently receive favorable coverage despite being objectively bad. This symbiotic relationship ensures that the same players have an effective monopoly on many of the most lucrative and beloved IPs, churning out the same turgid trash over and over again.

Fans of Star Trek need to understand that the Star Trek brand is gone, and that it is now in the hands of people who have no affection for it and no understanding of why it used to be so beloved. Fortunately, there is Seth MacFarlane's The Orville, which is the true spiritual successor to the Star Trek we love, filled with great characters and heart.

Avoid Star Trek at all costs, watch The Orville.",26 May 2020

"The main actress is awful. The cast and writing carry her but Hollywood feels the need to force a ""powerful black woman"" in the role.

She doesn't fit this role whatsoever",5 December 2019
"This in no way, shape or form is Star Trek. They simply stole some backstory, history and general aesthetics and crapped all over it.

Me, my family, my extended family have been life long Trek fans. But this beast needs to be put down and buried. The amount of obvious personal agendas and force messaging here is nauseating and absolutely unbearable. It's a sad time to be a fan of anything and an even worse time to be proud of almost any show you grew up on. Everything Hollywood touches from our youth, they destroy.

Stay Away.....Stay Far Away from this, and any Star Trek adaptation. Your sanity, self worth and brain cells will thank you.",20 March 2022
"I've watched it all the way to season 4 episode 10.

Having also watched most of the Star Trek older TV series since the first 60s and though I'm not a Trekkie I must admit it's the best Star Trek series I've watched so far.

The producers have thrown a serious amount of money at it and it shows big time. Comparing it with the Star Trek Enterprise which is the closest chronologically series to it it's a huge win for Discovery hands down. It's not just the SFX that is stunning for a TV series, it's also the story that sticks to Star Trek's fundamentals while keeping the viewer engaged.

Sure as some others have pointed out there's been some unnecessary crying mostly in the first 2 periods (many women and some of the other guys(?) aboard, what can I say?) but the story and the action scenes make up for that.

On the other hand, Star Trek was never just about pew-pew-kill-the-bad-aliens macho stuff (well maybe it was when Kirk was aboard, but those were troubled times). Some of the best science fiction (and not only fiction) ideas had popped out of it and ST Discovery manages to push that even further.

Yes, when the going gets tough there are some dumb references to 20th-century science to figure out a solution to a 23rd (or 32nd) century scientific problem, but we don't seriously expect a 21st century TV series to come up with valid answers to a 23rd-century problem which has not even hit us yet. We just watch it and go with the flow.

All in all a series that does Star Trek justice and a solid 8 from me.",10 March 2022
"There are those who won't like anything if it's different. It could be fear of change or it could be Star Trek snobbery. I like Star Trek. I've never been obsessive about it but I've enjoyed it's simplicity and it's determination not to take itself too seriously - a trait which perhaps some reviewers should try themselves. Anyway, at a risk of sounding controversial, he goes: At last. A Star Trek that actually looks like it could be set in the future. Finally, Klingons that look like they could be an serious alien race instead of obviously being humans with heavy metal hair, Ming the merciless-style stick-on eyebrows and foreheads that hark back to their walnut heritage. The Star Fleet uniform still tips it's cap to that of yesteryear and the bridge is now looks like it is the very essence of future technology. The actors are superb. They have been given a different brief: For the show to be grittier and not to have the show descend into the cheese fests characteristic among so many Star Trek filler episodes. There are no wide-eyed over-acting Shatners on this show using dodgy throws and double handed back blows to dispose of his enemies and for that, surely we must all be thankful.",22 February 2019
"To be honest, a woman with the name Michael, Klingons that looked anything but, and some other bits and pieces here and there that made it ""confusing"" to say the least.

But, after having seen the 6th episode ""Lethe"", this series grows on you, it is actually really good, I wont say its better than but its most definitely on par with, the other Star Trek series after 6 episodes.",24 October 2017
"Ignore the other reviews.

Yes this Star Trek is more ""serious"" than the old cheesy/campy Star Treks of old.

For now you also don't have fun episodes like TNG where they would spend episodes on the holodeck or Deep Space 9 where they'd goof off in the gaming quarter.

Either way this is a well written, well acted Star Trek with an excellent cast.

The technology, set design, Klingon design, uniform design are all super nice too.",7 November 2017
"Well, I'm a huge StarTrek fan, and I had to forget about last 700 episodes, and rename this show in my head to continue watching because this doesn't belong to StarTrek franchise, similar to some newer ST movies.

This show is 99% of action, 1% of science - something like Star Wars, so you need to turn on your SW mode switch in your head to see this. THEN it's okay show, I liked it.",28 September 2017
"I see this new, and quite original, Star Trek show has been getting a lot of vitriolic hate from Trekkie fans! (Geez...Tommy and Billy, let's get all of our Star Trek friends to unload immature and unwarranted hate 'cause, it's just not like the old shows we watched!) And while I enjoyed those old shows, honestly, they were kinda cheezy (but in a good way). Even Patrick Stewart acknowledged the lack of intellectual depth of STNG. From Hollywood studios, we all know it was about simple entertainment for a mass audience.

However, having watched Discovery from the beginning, I feel the backlash from haters is completely unwarranted. One doesn't have to like it or follow it. But one should, at least, be able to appreciate another artist's thoughtful and skillful interpretation within the ST pantheon.

Unlike its predecessors being more light-hearted and popcorn-oriented incarnations, this version is darker, more serious, and has a long story arc which, for me, is far more engaging. The characters, acting, CGI and interstellar environment are all handled expertly, and I enjoy the fact that Discovery possesses a more ""literary"" offering in the sci-fi genre than the common, easily consumable ""lets have fun in outer space"" TV series.

It's difficult to speculate whether the mob-mentality of its detractors will bring Discovery to an end. I, for one, hope the network and the show's creators/writers will be able to continue, increasing its audience, and maintaining the series' integrity in future seasons.",8 November 2017

"I am struggling with his series. Maybe a more apt title would have been 'Space love boat'.

Pros: Special effects are amazing, Phillipa Georgiou.

Cons: Acting is generally poor. A ""childish"" cadet made first officer? Get real! A starship spinning about its centre line? Michael Burnham - besides the Mutinous actions, insubordination is not a likeable character and does not come across as a good Starfleet officer.

Noteworthy: Michelle Yeoh - Best actress by far and playing the most interesting character, Georigiou",18 January 2021

"This series started out well and had great potential. It was geared to hook a broad target audience, but somewhere in season 3 the quality began to degrade and it transitioned toward a younger audience (18-25) where it has remained ever since. I think this was intentional since we now have Prodigy and Lower Decks for completely different demographics as well as Picard and the soon to be Strange New Worlds targeting a more sophisticated group of viewers longing for compelling stories. Discovery likely won't recover from where it now is but its loyal viewers are probably satisfied with the show the way it is.",23 May 2021

"Most reviewers that are giving Discovery a one star are because Discover is not the old start track. Thank god! Discovery is not a happy go lucky cast where the captain goes on dangerous missions (like that would ever happen in real life), the guy in red always dies, and each episode is one mission. The fact is those type of shows do not work any more. Discovery is trying something new and I love it! Its a more serious approach to the franchise.

I love it and hope this show and hope it sticks around for a lot longer then Enterprise did.",31 December 2017

Why all the bad reviews? Because Star trek fans are stuck in the 60s or the early '90s. Time to move beyond Picard and Kirk Heaven forbid there's a strong women besides Janeway seven of nine.

"I agree that Discovery doesn't do justice to the original Star Trek franchise. Still, if you try to watch the show without constantly comparing it to the original series, it's quite entertaining. Honestly the biggest problem of the show is the Star Trek title. Because of that most people are going to have hard time reviewing the show from an objective point of view. But if you do manage to do that, you are going to enjoy most of it.

First of all, the story is interesting and compelling. Perhaps not with the most original themes, but with solid plot and interesting psychology and drama among the characters. Some of the characters are a bit dull and lack proper personality, but there are a few gems among them, such as Tilly and Saru. I also don't have any complains about the acting. No actor seems out of place in the action-packed setting.

The visuals are comfortable to look at. Not amazing, but nothing bothers me about them.

The show would have been a success if it wasn't for it's name. The minute you start comparing it to the other Star Trek series, you'll start to hate it. So, 7/10 if it wasn't Star Trek and 5/10 as it is now.

I wouldn't say it's the worst Star Trek series. I mean, there's still Star Trek Enterprise...",28 January 2019

But is sad discover how it starts to look as a remake from the Star Trek Voyager set in another time era. I like it thinking in a good TV series but...it is not probably a good star trek TV series, probably the worse.

Another point, it wants be a drama but it is more close from a terror film. In the nine first episodes there is nothing more than terror situations and never a single joke. If you compare it with the last BSG, you will understand what I am saying better.

Remember, I give a 10 because I enjoy watch it but being a Star Trek fan, I gave to it a short five.",13 November 2017
"Edit: This show was 10/10 in the first series, but unfortunately it seems like the producers listened to the whining incels and they have watered it down until it became nothing more than a confused mess by S.4.

A lot of the hate you hear for this show comes from a certain breed of middle aged male living in their mothers basement, emerging from their beard to write diatribes (from the safety of behind the keyboard) about anything approaching change in a program bearing the Star Trek name because it doesn't trigger all the check-boxes within their OCD.

Don't believe it, it's beautiful, the story arc, the characters, the cinematography, the actors and the twists are utterly gripping, each episode keeps you salivating to find out what's happening next, just binge season 1 and make your own mind up.",13 August 2021

Also, I never saw so much crying in one TV show. Burnham cries for minutes in almost all episodes in the show. Someone even created Michael Burnham Crying Compilation on Youtube.

It has bravery, philosophy, humour, thrill, great fight choreographies, amazing visual effects. At moments it has naive details, and season 2 has one or two really unnecessary episodes but it's still worth watching. Tilly, Stammets and Jet Reno are pure awesomeness and they stand side to side with most likeable characters from all of the SF. Doug Jones and Michelle Yeoh are brilliant. The least fun guy is Spock and they could have go without that whole Spock thing, but STD is a fresh, entertaining and honest Star Trek spin off.",8 March 2020

Not many like the design of the new uniforms, but I do.

The Design of the Klingons is new, but after some time you go with it.

Sure, the Klingons are not Klingons and I wouldn't care if any of the characters got killed off. I haven't warmed to any of them but I feel the same way about all the characters in The Walking Dead. It also feels like the show has become a platform for today's social justice warriors.

I don't want to see nostalgic remakes of the previous shows and I will give it a chance to progress.",11 January 2018
"I have watched every episode of every Star Trek series ever made. I had big expectations leading up to the show. After I watch the first two episodes I thought it was pretty good, but I didn't connect it to the Star Trek brand that I am accustomed to. While they call this Star Trek it is more like an action sci-fi show because of All the discrepancies between this series in the previous Star Trek series. The first thing that stood out to me was this was 10 years before Kirk the original Star Trek get the technology is more advanced that doesn't make sense. The next thing that stood out to me was the creature that they used to power the sport drive and they were basically torturing the creature in till it was almost dead to Powers that drive which seems to go against the prime directive. I did think it was amusing that they said the f word a Star Trek show. So I'll leave it this I think most sci-fi fans like myself would enjoy the show it's not a Star Trek show. Yes they use these weird looking Klingons and Vulcans and the Federation blah blah blah but I wouldn't really say it's a Star Trek show it's an action sci-fi show.

"Well, the first 2 seasons were enjoyable, a bit far and different from the others series (TNG, DP 9, etc). The 3rd season is practically a soap opera .... i hate to say, it's making me sick to my stomach and I don't want to to watch it anymore (the 6th episode will be the last for me). No more Star Trek movies, the new series are ....blah, I'm afraid that, sadly, this is the end for the franchise.",1 December 2020
"I was hesitant to watch this show after reading some of the reviews (and because I was so disappointed in Picard). I have now watched seasons 1 and 2 and I really like it. The show's first two seasons are far better than other star trek series. DS9 didn't really start getting good until season 3; the same can be said for TNG, VOY and Enterprise (I've only seen a few of TOS episodes so I cannot make a comparison). I like that this series is darker than all other Trek series. What I enjoy even more is that most episodes are action packed. I gave it a high rating because of the cinematography-it is like watching a movie, not a television show. I think the acting is great although I hated to see Sonequa Martin-Green leave The Walking Dead. I know many said there was just too much focus on Michael Burnham but the show's storyline revolves around her character. I think this show is a refreshing, new take on the utopia that exists in all other Star Trek series. Side note-I love Spock in this show-love the beard! I'm looking forward to the Captain Pike/Spock star trek spinoff (already in production I believe). Enjoy!",11 November 2020
I can't speak for everyone but to me this show is a documentary. I say this because of the weird an unexplainable thing's I've experienced in life. Each season is something. Very interesting. I see so much truth in this show as if someone is sending a powerful message. I'm listening an I'm seeing the message. I'm awakening. Thank you for this show an all the hard work that went into this.,3 October 2019
"First, i have seen all star trek episodes (guessing more or about 500 - 600), and it is with that background that i will review this series.

The first two episodes are thrilling, full of suspense, great monologues, good acting and adopted many good things from other recent series that the crowds loved (like the death of protagonists, the non predictable outcome etc). There is a background story that you can follow too, unlike most of older star trek episodes. In general, if i didn't have in mind that this is the continuation of Star Trek, I would be VERY happy for this new science fi series.

On the other hand, OK, many of its viewers are Star Trek fans, that can still get into arguments like ""which captain was best"", and that have developed a mentality throughout the years BECAUSE OF Star Trek (Star Trek always promoted certain principles, starting with the prime directive). For most of them, even the latest Star Trek movie wasn't so ""Star Trek material"". If you are one of them (us), well just entertain your sci fi appetite with this new series, don't watch it like its Star Trek. I am personally happy it is introducing Star Trek to the new generation to some extent though.",26 September 2017
"Seasons 1/2 were great. But Michael can't or won't stop whispering and crying. It's gotten ridiculous. Everyone is so emotional all the time it's annoying. Now I just let it play in the background while I'm on my phone. But in all seriousness.. STOP WITH THE WHISPER TALK, PLEASE... Please?",30 November 2020
"So I just finished season 2, and at the same time I was watching TOS for the first time on netflix. I grew up with TOS movies, TNG, Voyager, DS9, Enterprise so trek for me is that is trek. Of these Enterprise disapointed me with the exception of the 2 episode story ""In a mirror darkly"" witch portraits the terran universe.

As for TOS, im actually glad I left it for last, its a great idea with too much of the 60's in it...

About discovery - Did not find it that nice when it started, did not really enjoy all those LONG klingon dialogs. Story greatly improved when Lorca came into the show and became awsome with Pike. Now as for the ending of season 2, well its been some time since I became excited about next season on any series so....",6 May 2019
"The storyline is not bad. But all the episodes are about Michel, she is the one that makes decisions, what to do or where to go. She is the only heroin that saves the entire universe and it always depends on what she does. It is too much about her and she is not even the captain!!! I'm a big fan of star trek and the greatness of star trek is the team work, the crew members have their roles and counted in a even way. I'd like to watch more actions that doesn't count on Michel but on others too.",5 December 2020
"This series goes from ten to one, because all comes to lgbt+++--- and soo , like whole universe is going this way !!! Even the ""aliens"" are woman's .... who imagined that ? Main deck crew somehow become pure woman ? What ????? I do like the performance of the actors it self but i do not like it ... !!!!!!!!!!!!

F this way of making movies !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I rather stop watching this !!!!!",2 December 2021
I think the storyline is not bad. The thing that it doesn't work well is the role of Michel... she decides as a captain and do what and when she wants... it is always too much for her role even for a protagonist.,4 December 2020
Please cancel the series and do us all a favor. This is an insult to Star Trek. NO MORE PLEASE. I finally understand why the lead actress cries in almost every episode... she is watching the series too.,20 January 2022
"The further I get into this series the more I like it, it looks great and I am finding the storyline intriguing. I know it's fashionable to denigrate everything online these days, but I am not following the crowd. Enterprise was easily the worst of these series, closely followed by Voyager, but they are still all better than so many other programmes.

Haters gotta hate right?",3 October 2017
"Season One -

When I heard that a new Star trek show was to be made I was extremely apprehensive, based upon the newer Sci-Fi shows out there I was worried that it would be all flash and no substance Having grown up with TNG and then seen every show and film made I was expecting a lot from a new show.

Discovery did not disappoint and could not be further from most modern day Sci-Fi shows, with strong plots, great acting and the true feel of trek running throughout the show this is truly a find expansion to the Trek universe.

Each episode has an underlying plot and covers a multitude of things from redemption to the rights of sentient beings.

Tilly is adorable and the main character Burnham's character grows throughout season one.

Each week I counted down the days until the next episode and was on the edge of my seat from week to week.

Season Two -

Simply stunning first episode to the new series, Anson Mount makes an explosive debut as Captain Pike, Tilly is still as awesome as ever and we learn more about Michael Burnham's back story.

The Space FX as breathe taking and we get to see the ""family"" vibe from the ship's crew, now the war is over they can come together and begin to heal from what they have been through.

Much like season one I am counting the days until Episode 2.

Unlike some of the other reviews here, I have actually watched the show and can base my review accordingly",19 January 2019
Dont go for the negative reviews.. the shows superb with supberb graphics.. a must watch,13 June 2020
"Despite all of the constant crying (Georgiou seemed the only one with a pair) and at times unrealistic character twists (who in their right mind makes a bumbling ensign a first officer?? Many more in line, experienced and proven under stress for such a position), this show managed to put the wow in me again in almost every episode. Fantastic special effects and a good storyline gave me many moments of wonder and fascination. They made me want to get out there, to boldly go where no one has gone before...",24 March 2021
"Having watched all other star treks in history it's nice to get a new take on it, there are a lot of basement dwellers giving it a 1/10 on here, I actually think the worst part of this show is these so called ""fans"" spewing their incomprehensible garbage all over Facebook and so on, it's a decent show and it getting better every episode, TNG would have got the same as the first few seasons were pretty poor.

For the rest of you reasonable people definitely give this a good go, it's definitely worth it.

For the others, just watch re runs and stop throwing your toys out of the pram, no one is forcing you to watch it.",12 January 2018
"All the drama in series are making me jump around episodes like grasshopper and hope that series called ""In previous episodes"" will keep me up to speed.

But the worst thing of all, is that annoying whispering of main characters, it's just like I, turn up the volume to hear what they are saying.

Funny thing is, that I like to watch them before getting to bed at night, and there is this type of scene, turn up the volume, next scene in a second, boom, something blowing up, ""Hello kids, hello neighbours""!!!

At the end, ideas are good, visuals are fantastic, but please, give the actors some serious vocal cords!!",8 March 2023
"What happened ??

The characters, well, have no character. They are pointless unless you're a far left activist.

I wouldn't trust them to put milk in my coffee let alone fly a starship.

Where are all the new species that aren't humanoid ?

There is no action only boring dialogue about doing the right thing, so please producers, do the right thing and pull the plug on this debacle that insults all previous Star Treks.",30 December 2021
"Having seen the first 2 episodes and I like it.

The series touches upon something that up and until now have only been a backdrop story of the Federation /Klingon relationship. The Federation- Klingon war.

It is hard to describe without spoiling but the reasons for the Federation and Klingons going to war. It is very likely and not without merit in human history. There are dozens of example if this.

The Vulcans are showing new sides too in the episode ""Vulcan hello"".

The series for the first part is focusing on establishing the back drop for the rest of the series so don't expect to much ""Star Trek Business"" as usual"". I think we can expect this to be a more darker version like DS9 but still with the hope that Star Trek was always about but a more realistic approach to it and that sometimes you come upon individuals whom for the better or worse can change history.",30 September 2017
The visual department has done well. A few interesting takes on a story initially but it all falls apart after that. Someone that supposedly was doing well and trained hard to lessen emotions cries at least 5 minutes in every episode. Highly trained officers lose discipline and argue about there gender in the middle of crisis. They are trying so hard to include 108 genders that it overshadows all logic of a story. A child cries bc again crying is a key theme in this show and it causes the fuel to go inert and fuel that is inert of course blows up? Some of the good things that were done with other star trek series is they talked to scientists to make it plausible. Instead they talked to a gender studies professor for cues and it shows. They even take cues from mcu and keep reviving characters. Oh life goes on. No character is dead and it would potentially hurt others doing so but let's do it anyway.,20 January 2022
"Star Trek: Discovery, demonstrated that you didn't need to be the Captain to be lead, it also demonstrated that you didn't need to be a white man either, true she wasn't the 1st non - white lead from the Star trek universe, but she was the 1st non white, non captain lead on the screen. Michael Burnham is a strong, stubborn and righteous, yes she rebellious, but with reason, and making her character, the adopted sister of Spock, added to the background of Spock, and how he wrestled with his bi-species half human \ Vulcan heritage.

Thank you Bryan Fuller and Alex Kurtzman for creating this entertaining character and thank you, Sonequa Martin-Green, for portraying Michael Burnham, so beautifully.",7 January 2021
"I generally enjoy this, as you don't have to pay too much attention watching it and it's very easy going. But I do strongly agree with the opinion someone else mentioned before: TOO MUCH CRYING. I mean it's alright to be emotional especially when members of your crew are dying but to cry in every episode .... a bit too much. But I truly enjoy the cast diversity, the effects and make up/masks, awesome work.",8 January 2021
"Discovery is a departure from previous Star Trek series. That's a fact. Anyone who jumps into this expecting it to follow the patterns established by the previous series in the franchise will be asking for disappointment. First, the format: this is a serial. Each episode starts from where the previous one ended. Second: the connections to the ST universe: they exist. Remember Sarek and Captain Pike? The character connections, though, won't be much stronger than that in Season 1, though; if that's a problem for you, stay away. On the other hand if you want to experiment with a different kind of ST series, keep your mind open and give this a try. Characters are less of cardboard cut outs. There is a new drive technology. There is a protagonist: a black woman, a human orphan raised by Vulcans (Spock's parents.) She is complex, conflicted, but also determined and brave. There is a same sex couple and they show physical affection on screen. The Klingons look different and are more violent and cruel. There are messy space-time issues. It is dark and somewhat dystopian. In short: the show is grounded on ST lore (no reference to Data's brother here) and does merit being in the franchise, but it is it's own thing and I'm grateful for that. I found it creative, interesting, and fun to watch. Maybe you will, as well.",1 January 2021
I enjoy this re-thinking of Trek. Haters relax!! This is a revision. I'm going along for the ride. All Trek versions are better than no Trek at all !,3 February 2019
"I don't know what this is. Grey's Anatomy in space? Whatever it is - it ain't Star Trek. And it ain't good . Please stop.

I don't know what else to say. I'm just going to say crap until I get to the minimum 159 characters .

Crap. Crap. Crap.",2 June 2022
"Whilst season one was truly atrocious and had to be ditched without watching it all, season two is everything it should have been! Classic Star Trek-esque stuff with a modern twist and high production values! I almost didn't bother but now I'm so glad I did. Even small things seem to have been fixed, seats in the Captain's ready room, Klingons growing their hair and looking like Klingons, etc. A proper away mission down to a strange world, with disguises and the prime directive ('general order one'). All in all much more fun so far and actually enjoying the characters as well as the main story arc. Thank you Netflix for listening to your fans and providing us with some proper Star Trek.",24 February 2019
"First time I've reviewed something on here but was compelled to after so much hate for this show. I find the show exciting and visually awesome. Sonequa Martin-Green is an enchanting actress and her character is one to be interested in. Jason Isaacs could be the best Captain on a Trek show since Patrick Stewart, he's a commanding presence and screams authority. Most people complain, this is not Trek, this doesn't follow Roddenberry's vision of hope. No, not yet. The original Trek dealt with the issues of the world in the 60's like racism and the Vietnam War. Discovery deals with the issues of today...which as we see are not always black and white but deep inside the grey. The Klingon War is an obvious allegory to the war in Iraq that we have been involved in since 2001. TOS dealt with hope in that timeline...this show is all about how we got to have that hope. Another issue I've read about is the special effects...who cares? Do we not think that if they had this ability with effects in the 60's that they wouldn't have had it look cleaner and with more gloss? TOS was consistently having it's budget slashed and did what it could with what they had at the time. CBS threw movie franchise money to make this show. I am a huge Trek fan and have watched every incarnation of the series many, many times over and I have embraced this new version. I have a feeling that the people complaining about this show are also the ones that hate the Abrams versions of the Trek movies. If you have an open mind and go into the show without bemoaning that it doesn't look like what the 60's thought the future looked like then I feel you will be pleasantly surprised. Give it a chance.",16 October 2017
"Wow, first time ever I felt I wasted my time on a Star Trek anything, and I'm a Trekkie from the old Kirk era...season 4 a disaster. Season 5 better get new writers and storyline quick as ratings are in free fall

Writing for Picard and Strange New Worlds is far far superior.....you get involved in the action and adventure...Star Trek Discovery you need tissues available...because those are your own tears for a dying, lethargic, waste of time soap opera. There's still time to fix this and that may be the greatest adventure of any Trek series.",26 June 2022
"Season 1 is unpredictable, and such an improvement for Star Trek, but season 2 near half way in, is undoing everything season 1 did, and is way too predictable. Reassembling almost the whole cast, several of whom were decimated in season 1, is so boring.",3 March 2019
Star Trek discovery is my second favorite of the series it has a Game of Thrones vibe to it is second only to TNG in quality I will deeply recommended even someone is not into Star Trek,16 June 2019
"I dont get why this has so many negative reviews, I actually like it. I've always been a star wars fan, and I know about the star trek universe, but never been really engaged in it until now. I found this series by mere accident on Netflix, and I love it, I think it's good and exciting, maybe I don't get the star trek universe, but that's fine. This is one of the only Netflix shows where am actually waiting every week excited for the new episode which comes on Fridays. Yes i think it's good, you should give a shot, maybe my luck with this show is that I'm not that much into the universe and I've never been a huge fan, but I love this show.",31 January 2019
I tried. I really did. I put up with all the annoying crying.I put up with the strange focus on one particular character. I accepted that there will be no positive roles for heterosexual white males(I always thought diversity included everyone) but the 3rd season is just too much. There are no likeable characters. All are annoying in some way. It says nothing positive about the future. It's a woke soap opera without any real focus or underlying intelligence. It's simply NOT Star Trek.,15 November 2020
"ST Discovery is an excellent envelope-pusher to add to the lineup of ongoing Trek TV Series. The story is engaging and the characters magnetic. You can actually get interested in this crew, each character is a distinct individual, several of which are striving for some personal goal. The Enterprise tv series was so disappointing bc its characters were bland and uninteresting. That crew was like one mono character, all the same. And Voyager was only marginally better with characters that were just barely distinct and interesting. The addition of Seven of Nine saved that one, thank god. But Discovery really ups the ante for future series. The goals of the ship and crew and the ensuing drama are intriguing. It keeps you guessing as to where its going. It introduces new tech and new ideas of what is possible in Roddenberry's universe. It has a hard edge unlike previous Trek series that helps to renew and refurbish the Star Trek world. This is a fresh take on Star Trek that changes up several familiar elements and yet retains enough of the core Roddenberry vision to stay within a recognizable universe while pushing at the boundaries. This is all reinforced by the presence of Gene's son Rod Roddenberry. As Executive Producer he is definitely carrying on in the classic Star Trek tradition while refreshing many of his dad's ideas. An absolutely fantastic series and a fine addition to the Star Trek family. Cannot wait to see what Stange New Worlds has to offer. Bravo! Bravo!",28 May 2021
"I enjoy the direction they've taken things with pacing, visual effects and a darker tone overall in Star Trek Discovery. Also, big fan of the first season being more or less one large narrative arch, which for me can be more fun than having a season made up off a collection of one-off episodes. With this ""new direction"" stuff in mind though, you might not like Discovery if you dislike new things, or just find your autisms especially triggered when anything post Gene Roddenberry gets made",15 December 2018
"Only way to watch is from the beginning. Not a fan of that.

80% of crew is women, other 20% is something else.

Too much of a change, first season wasn't bad but it has just gone down hill.

Makes you really miss the original series.",22 February 2022
"So Far I am very pleased with the first 2 episodes of what promises to be a great new series! I'm also glad that a 10 year hiatus was necessary to make the new producers realize that although the same in genre, change was an integral component in what will hopefully be a successful series. Maintaining a theme of equality in race, and gender, that Star Trek has always held in the highest regard, has not become a victim of social or political pressures. The characters are strong. The plot lines are strong, but most importantly, Discovery manages to reinvigorate the message sent out by the Original series while still serving the primary purpose of series television, to entertain! Thanks and keep up the good work.",25 September 2017
"There have been a bunch of bad reviews for this show, but if you're already determined to hate something, you're probably going to hate it no matter how good or bad it is. Discovery isn't perfect, but it's fun and there's plenty of action. I've been a Star Trek fan since I was a kid. My love of Trek started with Next Gen, and grew to include the OS, DS9, and Voyager. I started watching Discovery even after hearing ""It's not Star Trek, it's ruining the franchise"" from other ST fans who just seemed to me to be parroting back what they read/heard from other fans. If you start watching Discovery with an open mind knowing it isnt going to be the OS, TNG, or whichever series was your favorite, you might actually find yourself enjoying it.",28 January 2019
"Like Doctor Who....it is better editorially than it's ever been.

Meaning ""OK it might be an abomination, but we have everyone represented!"".

Genuinely can't believe how poor this is.",13 April 2022
"I don't normally write reviews and I'm not a writer, but this is Star Trek we are talking about so I will make an exception. I think this new incarnation is truly awesome. I am now sat on the edge of my seat every week waiting for the next installment. I don't know why Trekkies are writing bad reviews. This is way better than Enterprise was in my opinion. Enterprise was still Trek, and as a loyal fan I watched every episode, but Voyager was a hard act to follow, at that point in time I also really wanted to see what happened next after Voyager got home. With that said I think Discovery has got it right. It's 2017 folks and I think the special effects and graphics and amazing. The storyline is really good as is how the characters are unfolding. We can't tell another story in the same style as TOS or TNG. As much as I loved them we have moved on... As an old and very loyal Trekkie myself, I feel that they have really hit the nail on the head with this one. As for the Klingons... The subtitles are a little annoying, but they really do add the right atmosphere to capture the Kingon essence. I think they are now more Kingon than they have ever been, and again I think they have done a great job. Thankfully no one decided to revert back to TOS Klingons. So, these are my feelings on the new Trek. I am 46 years old and have watched every episode and movie several times over. I started watching Captain Kirk and crew on my black and white TV, and I get emotional when I see the Enterprise emerging from the clouds. And I think it's Fascinating...",9 October 2017
"Loved the pace of the show, and the way we slowly get to know the characters. On my 5th episode, and the captain and science officer are the most interesting and intriguing characters so far. This show is more like deep space nine, a little darker than the other cookie cutter two good shoes that the next generations was. The lead character is somewhat overdramatic",17 January 2020
Didn't think much of the first season although enjoyed it and set the scene for season 2 which was soooooo good. Loved it!!,21 April 2019
"Call it nostalgia if you will, but at our core Trekkies don't particularly care for great changes to Star Trek. Placing aside ""Encounter at Farpoint"" I can recall the reception to Star Trek TNG being less than stellar. In fact, it could be said every subsequent series after Star Trek TOS has been placed upon a pedestal, and given the type of criticism few television shows would ordinarily receive upon their first introduction. Personally, it wasn't until DS9's reintroduction of Worf, in ""Memory Alpha"" that my interest in the show was peaked; with Voyager, it was the Borg. Star Trek Enterprise had to be canceled, before I was bothered with giving it a second go. And I regret having not made that decision sooner, as we would be forced to wait 12 years before Star Trek would once again, be placed back onto the small screen. So, now we are introduced to Star Trek Discovery. Does the show capture the spirit of Star Trek? That remains to be seen. But, what I can say is that the series is not being dumbed down for the masses (JJ Abrams). And despite the awkwardness of the pilot episode, ""Battle At The Binary Star"" proved itself enough to temporarily alleviate my concerns that the series would be anything less than smart and character driven; hall mark characteristics of Star Trek. Time will tell if I still feel this way after the conclusion of episode fifteen. Expectations are high, this is Star Trek, after all. Until then, I'll refrain from passing final judgment on the show. As of today, 8 out of 10",26 September 2017
"Not sure why some of the fans of the original series slate this, it's brilliant and gives a great insight into the pre-Kirk years. Well acted, good plots and familiar characters. Ignore reviews and well done to writers and cast",13 September 2019
"OK I admit at first it was far from what I wanted. It went to places that were in my eyes not correct or valid. But the series has now bedded itself in. We have now what the ethose of star trek is all about. It challenges us to look at ourselves now which is what the original did. Do you forget that this was all about current issues in society? Rascim, sexism and inequality. That was the morality of star trek to look outside of ourselves and measure the impact of the whole rather than the one. STD goes in a bold direction to do something that keeps it new and so unknown. Iove it. But maybe I'm easily pleased with having star trek back on.",10 November 2020
"I really wanted to like this show; I've loved Star Trek ever since I started watching the Next Generation as a kid in the 90s, and whilst many series since have had their poor episodes, they all could be instantly recognisable as Trek - Discovery is 'Star Trek' in name only.

The main issues I have is that every season starts off with promise, and then slowly falls away during the seasons runs. Characters are overly emotional, stories fizzle out as they reach their conclusion (the origin of The Burn was just a total let down and totally bizarre IMO) and the science element of the show (which has always been important in Trek) just seems shoehorned in and totally inconsistent. There's also the amount of violence (particularly in seasons 1&2) which sure, is entertaining, but just doesn't sit right in the ST universe.

It does look great, the visuals are stunning and I'm sure it'll receive plaudits for its diverse cast (eye roll); but ultimately, it's just an average sci-fi show with cinematic special effects, nothing more.",11 January 2022
"This is a solid fresh new entry to the formula for me. I imagine die hard fans grinding their teeth claiming it is heresy, and thus lowering the overall rating, but.. Obstinate conservative fans could benefit by trying to adjust expectations, and by giving it a chance and enjoy the ride. If you are into Scifi overall I imagine you could. I know I did. A well made production such as this, especially if it doesn't drop the ball, deserves a shot. Really liked the dark tone, atmosphere and aesthetics. Good acting, strong women, and CGI on par. Nice!",25 September 2017
"Bad acting, stupid 8 year old level writing, not cannon, doesn't care about fans, and focuses on one self-centered character, NOT ST. .

"I like Star Trek.

Any Star Trek.

Considering how long it's been since we've seen anything new as far a series on TV goes, I'll take what I can get! Is it different than any of the other series? Sure, but so what? If we're looking for the same, all the existing series and movies are streaming if you don't own physical copies; watch those. I've seen some reviews where the complaint is that the time line has been breached. For Star Trek, that's hard to see and imagine. However, as others have stated, this isn't 1966 and the budget isn't $100 an episode. There are resources to push things further, to try things that couldn't be tried before. I'm happy to see something that's attempting to be different. It's a little tight right now but that's because they haven't had a chance to build the family that the other casts built over time. That's what it will take for things to come around. Time. Complaining about it already and reviewing it so harshly will only make it go away. Personally, I don't want it to go away. I'm tired of all the ""reality"" trash that's on now, that gets renewed year after year after year. I want the escapes that Star Trek provided me when I was a kid in the 70's with reruns of TOS and in the late 80's when I was a teenager with TNG. I love DS9. I love Voyager. I'm learning to like Enterprise (once you get past that awful theme song). I want the stories and the places and the familiar people week after week. I want something that isn't real.

Fiction. That's what it is. That's what it's supposed to be.

I'll keep watching. I'll keep telling people about it and singing it's praises because I want it to stay around for years. Seasons are short now. There are very few shows that have a 22-24 episode run per season anymore. That's what I want from ST: Discovery. Longevity.

I think Roddenberry would be ecstatic to know that Star Trek is back on TV. That there are new movies (that had a great respect for the original stories by employing the alternate time line BTW). That someone has the courage to push the boundaries a little and try some things with the idea he started. And he would be beside himself giddy to know that there are new fans being made for Star Trek even today. Think about it; for some of them, ST: Discovery is the first Trek they will have ever seen. Some have only seen the movies. And others, like me and a lot of you, have been around for decades watching, learning, cheering, crying and celebrating the experience that we get to have through Star Trek. It was always there for me when I had no friends or had a rough day at school. When I needed somewhere to go, they were there.

To complain about what it isn't forces you to miss what it is. And what it is is pretty awesome. I'll take what I can get because it's been gone for far too long. I missed it and I'm happy to see it back... no matter what shape it takes.",2 October 2017
"I am amazed and I am not easily amazed, as someone who has seen almost everything in the Star Trek and Star Wars universe. Here we have the the modern embodiment of the core of what made the originals - imperfect humans wielding incredible technology up against the wonders of discovery. I just finished Season 1 Episode 4, and this is also the most militant star trek series. The original and Next Gen were about exploration, DS9 was about space station, Voyager was about a journey, Enterprise was about developing technology, and as S1E4, Discovery is about war. I appreciate Discovery's adherence to the tradition of sticking with a new theme, but I knocked one star off because war is the farthest theme from the concepts of the originals. It is also noteworthy this is a serial with a continuing plotline between episodes and not episodic like the originals. I only cry that it will only be accessible to the most tech savvy who can watch on digital services such as CBS All Access, Prime, and VUDU. Every other Star Trek show has has had the opportunity and ability to inspire the imaginations of anyone with a television.",13 May 2020

"To political correct. Too little exploring, it is more like a soap opera in space. Maybe a little bot cheap prodution? They are using the same scenery setup for the federation and other enemy ships, you recognise it easily.",29 January 2021
"I love all things Star Trek, and season 3 was the best Discovery season yet! In a way it reminded me of Voyager - a stranded federation ship that was surrounded by different cultures and histories which they didn't understand. I can't wait for season 4!",26 January 2021
"Love it so far. Finally a refreshing take on the series with better actors, script and directing than many of its stale, predictable predecessors.

Most of the negative reviews here are from Trekkies who only want to see TOS / TNG replays indefinitely.

I understand that to some extent. You grew up with it and it reminds of you of your childhood. I did with TNG. But as iconic as they were, 2017 need this type of Star Trek.

Please keep this series going!",9 October 2017
"First of all, i'm a major Star Trek fan. And i have to say this did not really disappoint me. Its IMO what more slow paced, but has great potential.

It reminds me of DS9.. I hated that the first 2.5 seasons, but ended up really enjoy it.

It also reminds me of StarGate Universe. Slow start, and of course people instandly started wining... Then it got really great, but got cancelled.. (And now the Whiners where whining it got cancelled, its never OK for some..)

So i hope people will simply give this a chance, even only (Just to remind you) that this is the only Star Trek we have left at the moment.. DO NOT DESTROY IT!

I most certainly will continue to watch, but generally because i entered this series with an open mind.. And i say it again, i did enjoy the Pilot.",27 September 2017
"I've endured the various iterations/seasons of this show because apparently I must watch every single Star Trek episode produced. Each season has it's own smattering of clean and promising ideas that go some way to make up for glaring inconsistencies, unnecessary shark jumping and some shallow & stereotypical characterisations.

I really just have two suggestions to make my journey less painful: Get the hug count down to a maximum of one per episode - not only will this cut these now utterly repetitive scenes but will affect all the scenes & arcs where we find out why this person needs a hug, putting focus on some action or interesting developments, y'know like Star Trek.

Try for less whispering of lines for dramatic effect - maybe even less dramatic effect.",7 March 2022

"I have hated this series until series 4. It seems that it is the worst rated series to date and I am not sure why.

Is it that new Star Trek I want? No. I have watched every episode of Star Trek ever made and have watch the TOS and Next Generation several times over, watching dozens of episodes over 20 times. So I don't love this program, but the direction of travel is a good one: the optimism is returning, the acting is a little too emotional and the storylines are a little melodramatic. However, I am beginning to enjoy it. Please don't cancel it now.",2 January 2022

"Not sure what this series will become. I am not impressed by the look of these Klingons, they look pretty terrible.

I can't say much about the storyline yet, because so far I've only of course seen 3 episodes. It started with a pretty big ""bang"", so let's see how this continues....",4 October 2017
"Star Trek in all its incarnations is an interesting series, and I do have many complaints about every variant of the franchise, but I'd still like to see more from this particular one ( Discovery ), if they can just get a few more things right. For me, where Star Trek goes wrong is easier to describe by using examples from Next Generation, Voyager, and DS9 - which is that it was too ""clean"" and ""nice"", and this is where Enterprise was an improvement ( certainly can't complain about the lovely Jolene Blalock ) ... but even Enterprise for me didn't hit the mark. If you go have a look at the truly GREAT science fiction authors: Harry Harrison, Isaac Asimov, EE 'Doc' Smith, and others, what you find is something missing from most Star Trek episodes since Nimoy and Shatner gave us Spock & Kirk ... and that missing ingredient is HONEST social commentary ... what we get in it's place is something that seems like such a thing, but which is actually just another mainstream social narrative validating the status quo. Take for example the language used in these shows, notice that never once will you hear the word 'anarchy' used with any honesty about its true meaning ( ie: ""no rulers"" ), and instead we are told that anarchy is synonymous with 'chaos', which is just an absolute lie. TV and cinema do more than entertain, they educate, and while an intelligent audience will want their mind stimulated by an intelligent story with brilliantly played characters and insightful social commentary, what we get instead is emotional manipulation and BS, which is utterly tedious, because it's always the exact same nonsense in slightly different words. If Star Trek Discovery was written with a bit more honesty about the reality of the darker side of our society and the lies we tell ourselves, it could be fascinating ... but I'm not holding my breath to see Hollywood fund such a film when they seem to be entirely allergic to it.",9 May 2020
"Every time I watch this show, I feel like I did when I was a boy watching it with Picard. I love this show. It's not always 100% but it makes you feel! That's the main thing! :)",8 January 2021
"Contrary to many, I found myself enjoying the first season quite a bit. The sets, story and charaters were all quite interesting, if not entirely ""classic Star Trek"" or scientifically / logically sound. For example, I enjoyed the active, strong, resourseful captain character.

Lately, however, (season 3) more and more screen time seems to be spent on:
characters looking at each other in extreme display of love and whispering lovetalk at each other;
characters standing all teared up or nearly there;
manifestations of goodness so extreme it trumps any practicality;
manifestations of honour so extreme it ...


Not only do I feel this has been overdone a little bit, It's at the point I get so annoyed I just can't watch it anymore and turn the streaming service. I do return, for now.",14 December 2020
"Star Trek Discovery has simply lost its way. I have completely lost interest in watching the it as it is nothing like Star Trek. I simply wont waste my time watching this show anymore however I felt the need to write a review because Star Trek has comply lost its way. It simply doesn't feel like Star Trek anymore, I don't know what I'm watching anymore that's why I have stopped watching it.",10 April 2022
"I am a sci fi buff and willing to give every show a chance. I watched every iteration of Star Trek and during this journey there have been a few hits and a few misses. Season 1 started off well enough, introducing new characters and in particular, the captain, portrayed by Jason Isaacs. After a long break it was nice to have Trek on TV again I thought. Boy was I wrong. Ever since the departure of Jason Isaacs the show has gone down hill. Still I kept on watching as there were still a few nuggets to be found. But by the time season 4 came around, I finally had enough. For some bizarre reason the show seemed to be obsessed with the LGBT relationships in the show. Last count I think there were 4 gay love stories concurring during the 4th season. This is not the Trek I signed up for. I'm actually left leaning in my politics but this was too much for me. I signed up for action, suspense and drama..not an LGBT soap opera.",24 October 2022
"Even were it falls flat it entertains. I grew on star trek and have enjoyed every iteration of the brand. If you can put aside certain toxic fandom snobbery and just enjoy the show for what it is, fun, then you won't go wrong. Also the special effects are too notch.",20 April 2019
"Before watching the seasons I was reading all the ""bad reviews"". Since I like the series I said, well, let me see how ""bad"" it is.

I ENJOYED IT FROM START. I could not relate to these reviews that I've seen. I was captivated and wanted to see how it continues.

It is supposed to be different and somewhat to be integrated withing the series. I have nothing bad to say about the first two seasons. Even my wife wanted to watch it and we were eager to find out what will happen next. We still are waiting for the third season to start.

Thank you for the moments. They were awesome!

I like the new tv show star trek discovery but i don t understand why are they force feeding us a gay story in this tv show. It is really unpleasant and not related to any of the previous Star Trek shows. I almost quit watching the show because of that . It makes my stomach turn ... Are they trying to change a show about science and human virtues in a gay show ? I am really disapointed about that !!!!,9 April 2019
"A lot of the negative reviews I read seem to have been written by people who are or have been fans of the old Star Trek. They sound like old people who don't like new things.

They mention how the show isn't anything like the old Star Trek, because it has ""action"" and ""explosions"". Which is true. And in my opinion that's exactly what makes the old Star Trek boring to watch in this day and age.

Sure, the 'old' Star Trek was about unification and how all our Earthly problems had been solved and how we go out to find new species and be nice and kind and brotherly (or sisterly) behavior. Fantastic things to put in a sci-fi show, but not something I like to see milked and get stale.

This is where Star Trek Discovery comes in. It takes the whole concept to a new level with more dynamic characters, eventful sequences, and NEW sci-fi goodies to drool over, all with a budget that Star Trek was deserving off since they first came up with the concept (but never got until the reboot movies and this show).

Star Trek fans who liked the tacky older shows (Enterprise wasn't too bad either, in my opinion) will find their childhood or nostalgia ripped apart. The new generation (ha, see what I did there) will enjoy the reiteration of this show in this form and make the Star Trek fan-base only grow bigger.",13 November 2017
"So, just got done watching Star Trek: Discovery Season 2. This season brings a mystery to the show arc, a new Captain (Defense of the Dark Arts Trope) in the form of Captain Pike (ask a die hard Trekkie), and a de-emphasis on Klingons (thankfully).

The show has learned much from its early season 1 blunders, and features much more focused plots and much less indulgence in its differentness. That said, it is still too different to ""feel"" Star Trek-y, even with Spock, Sarek, Pike, and even the Enterprise in tow. I still feel the cardinal sin of this series is its insistence in being the Roddenberry universe, instead of being some pocket universe of its own, which would be much more acceptable on most accounts by all but the most nit-picky fans.

As for the characters themselves, Captain Pike (Anson Mount) really shines in his second chance at the helm of a starship for the TV audience. His relationship with the Discovery crew is instantly organic, and he foils well against the new antagonists, Section 31, the enigmatic starfleet ""spy agents"" where the slimy but secretly good hearted mirror Georgiou (Michelle Yeoh) has found a home. But the real star of the season is Spock (Ethan Peck), for whom the search for takes up the better half of the first part of the season. His tormented character, and backstory with Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) bring both conflict, ponigantcy and clarity to the storyline in a way only Spock can do.

There are several shockers along the way, with unexpected character arrivals and departures in some episodes happening refreshingly unexpectedly to keep viewers guessing. Unfortunately, the plots are not always engrossing enough to keep viewers glued to the screen instead of their ipad, book, or knitting in between to rate it as truly must see TV. Then again, has any Star Trek series ever been that good? Perhaps our expectations in a word of Game of Thrones and the The Walking Dead is just expecting too much of our Sci-Fi side dishes.

"I see a lot of unwarranted hate for this show. 1s? Really, what kind of shows really deserve a 1? I have watched a lot of Star Trek in my time. Next Generation holds a special spot for me... and I didn't really get into Enterprise. Discovery is very different in that it's focus is taken away from the captain's chair and dies focus on another character's story arc. I also like the nods to the older series. It is a fresh new take on the franchise. This is not your Daddy's Star Trek. I think the show continues to break new ground by offering an openly gay couple, which I've seen silly complaints about.. they wanted to do the same thing in the 80s on star Trek, but the networks were too restricive... they can finally push more boundaries, which has always been the Star Trek way. I really dig the way the show us coming together an am glad I ignored the haters to give it a shot!",11 January 2020

Costumes and the details within the ships are gorgeous!",10 February 2018
... The constant over dramatic music is off putting and annoying. This is also often coupled with characters seemingly making the speech of a lifetime once every ten minutes. The story is good and it doesn't need the over dramatic and over emotional acting. Tone it down director.,11 April 2021
Suddenly pulling it from Netflix and all preceding seasons not a great idea! I am not going to sign up for yet another service just for that. I did enjoy it though. If I live long and prosper maybe it'll make its way back on syndications - unless it loses market share.,2 December 2021
"I have seen all three series a couple of times by now, and I found this series grows on me. No, it's not a spin-off from other Star Trek series, but imho this also is the strength of Discovery. Because Yes, to me it really is a representative of the Star Trek universe ...

Remained are the Federation Star Ship characteristics. Remained is the Federation universal philosophy. Remained is the variaty of Federation species, be it ""evolved"" somewhat ... Remained is the hero - villain approach and positive outcome, as a backbone in most episodes. Remained is also the ""Dark Mirror"" universe with the more ominous character equals.

Different is the new Spore Drive of Discovery, where an astro-mycelium network makes instantaneous travel across the Universe possible (far superiour to the Warp Drive). Different is the modernisation, the look and feel of Discovery, as being more in line with todays CGI capabilities. Different is the manner in which stories and characters play their part: to me a bit over-emotional and somewhat simplistic from time to time. Different also are the storylines, being a bit tedious long sometimes, perhaps superfluously detailed.

However, all in all I really enjoyed Star Trek: Discovery! To appreciate this series it has to be viewed by it's own merits, and to me Discovery is boldly rather than moldy ...",4 April 2021

I've been a trekkie since 1966 but this is not Star Trek. This is just a vehicle to push the politically correct LGBTQ+everyotherletterofthealphabet agenda and embrace diversity BS. What is it with TV in America now that they have to push this down our throats in every episode?

The character palette could be better but there are some interesting characters in there. The one bad thing I need to state is that the main actress, Sonequa Martin Green is talentless. She plays bad! And she plays a lot. That's very irritating but if you can get past that it's an enjoyable show.",6 February 2019

"Just a disclaimer. I am a long time ST fan from the original series, movies, etc. Huge scifi fan not just for TV and movies but also books. STD has let me down. A lot of reviews discuss the diversity/wokeness of the show as a negative. Honestly, that is not the crux of problem with the show. Having a diverse cast is not an issue. What is an issue is that the characters are only diverse in their appearance and creed. Deep down they are all written the same way. They are all whiny, weak, bubbly fearfull children instead of seasoned professional scientists, explorers, adventurers, fighters. In addition, a lot of the dialogue does very little to advance the plot. The dialogue is just filler to just clue us in on how everyone feels about their predicament. A one hour episode could be condensed into a 5 minute short if all the pointless talking was removed. I hope people involved in it do not dismiss such reviews and try to understand that if we wanted to watch people talk about feelings for 1/2 hour, we could do this with other shows whose genres are targeting that audience. There's no need to turn ST into one of those shows (too late).",26 November 2021
"I have finished 4 episodes and I find myself continuously and spontaneously blurting out ""wow"" as I watch this show.

Please don't try to kill this show by getting angry because it doesn't follow Star Trek canon. A ""1"" score is a sign of anger because all bad movies in IMDb are at least ""3"". A home movie made by total amateurs might be a ""1"".

I am not a purest and do not care how accurate this show is to the Star Trek canon. Perhaps those who were determined to hate this show have already voted and the aggregated score of this show will gradually rise. I hope so because I'd like to see multiple seasons of this show and a high IMDb score will encourage others to watch it.

The special effects and set designs are at the level of a high-budget (over US$ !00 million) movie yet my understanding is that there was US$ 7 million per show. An amazing accomplishment in getting maximum bang per buck.

Also my understanding is that there are complex inter-corporation politics of what the producers were allowed to use from the original Star Trek series. In a way, this gave some creative freedom to the writers to come up with new ideas. This freedom also allowed them to change the mood and feeling of the show and it seems to have moved in a direction that is less cerebral and more visceral. This show socks it to you at a high pace.

In addition, the writing, character development, and acting are all top notch. So far I can see other interesting looking characters in the background and am looking forward to their character development as well.

I choose to bite the bullet and get the service without advertisements and I think that was a much better experience. Because of the quality of the show, it is easily worth the cost. In addition, you can watch ""Big Bang Theory"" when you want and without advertisements. I simply installed ""CBS Access"" on my Roku and watch it like Netflix.

So please ignore the angry people. The aggregated score for this show should be an ""8"" or more and I suspect it will rise to that eventually.",14 October 2017

"Well, at least it's liked in Poland. There were no Klingon wars prior to the Kirk Universe. CBS was so involved with the lawsuit against the Anaxar folks that they apparently lifted their out-of-whack time line about a war that never happened in the Original Series and injected it into their new ""series"". Maybe that's the only reason they let loose the Dogs of Law at the little guys whose only broken law was creativity. Corporate America examine your soul. (Yes, you have one).",24 September 2017
"I wrote this review because I was horrified by the absurd reviews of 1 star and idiots saying it's cr@p. I've watched that and this isn't it. But maybe it's not star trek TV either though it is exactly like a crossbreed of the recent films and the old TV shows like enterprise or voyage.

I love trek. I didn't love the new films as they're mostly dumb and starwars but starwars isn't even starwars now so who cares at this point as it's all by committee. Bryan fuller is a visionary and this isn't his show anymore and that's the greatest loss.

Moving on what do we have. A good but not yet great lead. Amazing effects. Action over intelligence. Boring generic characters. New Klingon. A total rewrite or past tech and ideas. Some odd pacing and poor writing. Though somehow I loved it. Yes I felt it was dumb but enjoyable dumb and exciting and fun. So I say we have no star trek but now we have some. Give it a chance and it may surprise you. If it doesn't well blame cbs and j j abrams and people who love transformer movies.

"First season resumes the actual color of this series: «We are scientists, not warriors». My advice? Just jump to the third season, where writers remember the Trek part of Star Trek.

There is no story, nothing fit together. I would guess every episode is a bunch or writers & a director who want to do their own thing.

On a positive side, the effects are great & the ship is beautiful. But please don't call this Star Trek.",18 November 2021
"I'm going to state up front, I'm not an original fan of this show - so I'm watching this fresh with hardly any knowledge of the canon.

I think this is a brilliant TV show - I was hooked from the start, and can I also just say, was seriously refreshed to see women and diversity up front and centre. This is space adventure with human heart set in an incredibly well-drawn universe. I love the balance between story of the week into the series arcs. I'm a massive fan of the characters of Saru, Mikel, Tilly and Phillipa in particularly - and have adored watching their arcs unfold.

All the original, well beloved series' are still there, nothing has been destroyed. Get a grip. I certainly didn't want to watch another Star Trek show that was just a regurgitation of all that had gone before so I welcome the change in look and tone. Sure, the dialogue is clunky, Hello....it's Sci-Fi, not Shakespeare.The characterisations are a bit thin (first season, come on!) And, yes the Klingons look different. GASP! Errr, check out TOS and TNG. The Klingons look different too! UNGASP!! It's more blam-blam, in your face rather a cerebral trip, but it's entertaining, and though it kind of doesn't feel like Star Trek yet (We've only had a season after all), that doesn't matter to me. I was entertained and thoroughly enjoyed it. I have a feeling that a lot of fans went into this determined not to like it, whatever it was like, so lose the baggage of 50 years, switch off your brain and enjoy it for what it is..Bang, bang entertaining Sci-Fi. I just hope we get to say hello to Jason Isaacs in season two.",19 January 2019
It started out good. But turned into a big woke soap opera. I just want to watch start trek without pushing this woke stuff in your face. The original series pushed the envelope of equality.

"I just don't understand the need nowadays to shun anything that alters or adds to what happened in the past. It's the same way with other franchises (Star Wars: The Last Jedi). It seems that it's impossible to judge a show on its own merits and what it can add to a legacy. I really enjoyed Star Trek: Discovery. Of course, I have seen the whole first season, which I guess many of the one-star reviewers have not. I have seen every episode of every Star Trek show and movie ever created, so I know a little. I love each of them for their own special qualities, and recognize the efforts made to bring them to the screen. It was the same way with Star Trek: Enterprise, which was fantastic, especially once it found it's own personality in later seasons. This IS Star Trek! We have always known there was a war with the Klingons (and Romulans). I think this show does a remarkable job of showing the horror or the war, rather than the cleansed view offered in other series. I found the acting engaging, and felt the same way waiting for the next episode that I did in 1968 as a young boy, maybe even more so. My sole complaint was that it was stream-only, and I have cruddy internet, so it was difficult to watch on a slow network. I found a way. I think everyone needs to chill about canon and ethics, etc. and just watch the show. All of it. Then, if you really feel so strongly that it killed Star Trek, so be it. At the very least, we have a new Star Trek to hate on. On, and I LOVED Star Wars: The Last Jedi.",5 September 2018

"Some people may complain that this show veers from older star treks... but so what? I mean the old star treks are classic but at the same time they weren't in the mind of being classics at the time.

This show does that. You get the space battles, the discovery, new sciencey mumbo jumbo and different races and cultures. I can't say that they do it all perfect, but the effects are pretty good and the story is entertaining. Some characters are a bit wooden, but it's not like that's anything new for Star Trek and at the end of the day if you want something to canologically click and work with all prior iterations of a beloved show... well I won't say it can't be done, but 9 times outta 10 I bet it'll just be forgettable.

Is this show forgettable... no, it's got it's own style certainly. Of course it's effects are updated but in 20 years it'll probs just look goofy. The story is fun. There are twists and turns and some will actually surprise you. For that reason it's a positive from me.

10/10 would star wars again.",15 February 2018
"If you decide to watch a show called star treck you have to know what your getting yourself into. It will clearly be scifi and similar in concept to the movies. In my opinion this show is way better than the movies and there has only been 4 episodes so bar. You have to like adventure hence the discovery part and this a truly unbelievable show. I hate when people give a show like this a bad rating when it should be no less than a 9 and maybe even higher. If you watch basketball, you expect to watch sports and know what your getting yourself into. this is the same concept except this is scifi so people should expect scifi and the only people who give this a bad rating are those who clearly don't know what they got them selves into so please don't comment with garbage when you don't like the genre... we don't go around screaming watching sports is stupid considering most people who watch it are horrible at the sport themselves. Leave scifi to the scifi lovers and if you don't like scifi just don't watch this but if you do.. YOUR IN FOR A TRUE TREAT!!",9 October 2017
"Personally speaking i dont like it very much since i'm used to the ""old"" Stark Trek like Voyager and TNG. What bothers me the most and i know its stupid and silly is the technology they have it looks WAYYY more advanced than Voyager and klingon looks dumb and i'm sure many people agree with me. it has some good merits tho several episodes and nicely done and some are just bad",2 February 2019
"The first two seasons were okay. It would be better than okay if we be spared gay melodrama between a doctor and his undead partner on board the ship. Season 4 so far is so boring that I don't even care what is going on there. Most characters are women - captain, federation president, Vulcan ambassador, warriors, academy students, etc. Those who are not ladies are male aliens. There is no balance there - the show is clearly for the ladies. Oh, there is a synthetic boy with earrings who look like a girl. The ladies have to explain their feelings with occasional teardrops which gives me a reason to stop watching and go find some snack in kitchen. This show is almost a caricature of Star Trek in season 4. The show wants to boldly go, but it does not know where.",16 August 2023
"Season 1 was a 1 star. Hated the convuluted premise, all of the characters except for Burnham and the whole season was ham fisted and pretty unwatchable. Love season 2. Captain Pike! A real storyline. Thank god for Kurtzman. Love it...",14 February 2019
"The premise had possibilities. The execution was terrible. Here and there the humanity kicked in but the over reliance on gimmicks failed the writers in many respects. That's owned by production and editing.

They need to rescue this series in the next season.",17 April 2021
"Can't say how bad this show is because it is that bad. Lets just say that anything good in it was washed, no rinsed out in the first season which most real trekkies hated anyhow. By the time this show hit season 3 you should know, if you have a brain in your scull that you are being intellectually insulted by the moronic writing. Nothing to see here folks, move on. Worst Trek eva.",15 January 2021
"This is the best Star Trek i ever saw. In with the new, out with the old. This realy blew my mind, great work!",25 January 2019
Very surprised as thought I wouldn't like it. Excellent acting and a new look from an officers eyes.,13 February 2019
"I'm trying to understand all of these 1 and 2 star reviews. Is it the same 3 or 4 people just creating multiple ID""s or are we really that far apart in our appreciation of this series?

I'm really enjoying Season 1. It's especially great to see an emphasis on the Klingons, which has always been lacking (for me) until now.

Interesting characters, good writing and outstanding special effects. I'm looking forward to season 2.",12 August 2018
"It is very hard to take this show seriously when it has Clem Fandango (Shazad Latif) as one of its main stars I am starting this fresh as I have not watched any of the other Star Trek series so I am not as critical as others , its not the best Sci-Fi series I have watched but its not the worst either It seems entertaining enough for a time filler , I will keep watching it for the time being.The acting is OK and the effects and make up seem pretty good as well , at least you can watch an episode and see more than just a studio",10 November 2017
The story is amazing and keeps you engaged every episode! The special effects are movie grade and really bring you in to the moment. Every character is superbly cast and very interesting. This is no doubt the best Star Trek premier season ever.,14 November 2018
"This does not continue from the older series but is a further transition from Enterprise where the characters began to be less plastic, Vulcans weren't perfect and there the crew was often very outmatched and had to use their wits.

Some of this series so far reminds me of GR's other series Andromeda - a very badly acted series with what I thought were very good ideas and premises....but again, really bad acting. (Someone should remake that with good people.) The slipstream idea seems to be similar to the organic fabric of space premise in Discovery.

If you are in your 20s, you may have no attachment to the earlier series and this will be your anchor for when 20 years down the road it is changed again and you might not like it.

If you are in your 50s, well, you might end up watching the myriad of reruns on the older series and leaving this one out. Truth is the Next Generation was 20% good plots and rest soap operas. DS9 had much more action but was also soap opera-ish. Voyageur had a lot of men reacting to a woman captain which was unkind since I thought she was excellent.

Lets see how this series evolves ?? The scientific disconnects between this one and previous ones given that it takes place before the time of the original series (Shatner) hopefully will be reconciled in the end.",22 October 2017
Season 4 quality for story line is already turning down for the worse. Season 3 was good until the ending just made the whole season pointless. Science is taken out. More fantasy now.,18 January 2022
"I see so many 1 stars. Ffs its not that bad, i actually like it. Seems like there is alot of star trek fan boys out there that thinks this show is bad just because its not the way they remember star trek",27 January 2019
"This is a woke fest par excellence. Every burning topic is covered or represented and the underlying message is tolerance. There's nothing wrong with tolerance - the opposite - but too much medicine can kill you. In the 4th season I started to skip everything that was not strictly story related but focused on reflection, awareness, emotions and so on. And I think I have skipped over half of each episode. But the most pressing question is: why is Burnham constantly whispering? Who talks like this? It drive me crazy. Skip! Great special effects though. That's probably the worst of all star trek spin offs although it has one of the best CGIs of all of them. The other one on Paramount+ with captain Pike is much better.",18 March 2023
"Discovery is a much needed shot in the arm for a franchise that was failing. Apart from the Chris Pine movies, the franchise was circling the drain with nothing on tv screens since the very poor Enterprise almost a decade ago. The producers have taken a couple of risks and it has paid off with an intelligent series that treats it's audience as adults.",8 November 2018
"I have watched the first episode and the first ten minutes of the second episode.

After the first episode I was a little confused about one of the story lines but the beginning of the second episode gives background that provides clarity.

The story line of the first episode is a little illogical (if I may use that expression) but I can overlook it.

At the beginning of the second episode the story line immediately picks up.

Costumes are great. Script is excellent save for one of the story lines being a little far fetched. The writing isn't the best I have come across but it is passable.

True Star Trek fans should be pleased.",28 September 2017
"Star Trek. Discovery is the new Star Trek series that's light years ahead of its predecessors 😏 While the original was ahead of its times in many ways, the new series opens up to a whole new audience. Yes it's still sciency, but the action and storylines mean it will be enjoyable for someone other than just the sci-fi fans. Highly interesting and recommended for everyone wanting a good action series, sci-fi or otherwise.",3 January 2022
I really really disliked season one had nothing to do with star trek but season two was much better and now i hope season three will be even better.,22 October 2019
"As Star Trek fans from way back we watched the two episodes available on Netflix with trepidation, after reading lets face it, less than rave reviews.

Sorry but we loved it, good story line, great graphics, strong characters. I did notice a couple of technical issues with color matching but I am sure these minor technical issues will be resolved.

When watching, the makers of the new series assume you have already seen previous versions of the franchise, which is great as they don't give massive back flashes.

Give it a go, you may well become a Star Trek Discovery fan.",27 September 2017
"I'm not a real Trekkie although I've seen all episodes from The Next Generation, Voyager and Enterprise and I also like this new series. I'm quite easy to please so there's nothing really bothering me like real Trekkies probably encounter. But I do have to say that I'm also watching The Orville and it really gives me more feeling watching Star Trek (like the old ones) then this new Discovery series. If you don't like Discovery I really recommend you to watch the Orville it's very good and it feels more like The Next Generation with more humor even though it's not an official Star Trek, it sure feels like one.",3 October 2017
"As a long time fan of the Trek shows going back to the original series, I was excited with the launch of a new one.

At first it was ok, but then started to get heavy into pushing the woke stuff, got worse with overly emotional hambone acting, and finally put me off for good by featuring a failed Georgia political candidate. I'm done.

I can only guess they are going for a new crowd, existing Trek fans considered expendable. Either that or they are just plain bad at Science Fiction.

:shrug:",21 March 2022
"I know that some old-time fans of the show may be disappointed that this version of Star Trek is different from the 80s and 90s, BUT, and this is a big but, this does not mean that the current version is poor. In fact, the opposite is true. If you take this series and consider it in a vacuum, without bias and without prejudice, you would agree that it is one of the best sci fi shows on TV today. It is simply excellent and I hope that the producers will continue for many seasons to come (I just wish there were more vulcans in the series!)",28 April 2018
"I watched Star Trek as a child and always enjoyed it. Star Trek Discovery Season 1 was fun, modern and everything I'd hoped it be. I loved the diverse characters and the story itself. In high spirits I sat myself down for the first episode of S2 and I was nothing short of overwhelmed. What the heck all happened? The pacing of it all was so rediculously FAST! At 29 years of age, I felt OLD. Watching Star Trek for crying out loud! I hoped it would slow down with episode 2 but no such luck. It even detracts from the story which is a shame. If they'll keep this up i'll have to drop this in the same offence-bin with Designated Survivor. SLOW DOWN. Also, who thought the vintage colorful uniforms were a better idea than the modern ones from S1? Ugh. I'm so sad now :(",25 January 2019
"Yeah, sure, these old gen Trekkies fans voting down this show as a collective, but seriously, 1/10 or 2/10 for this show? You can´t be serious at all ... go get a life.

First season was a big surprise and 2n season triumphed with never seen before ideas, visuals and plots.

Star Trek Discovery is a 7 - 10/10 for a 47 year old StarTrek/StarWars fan like me.

It´s a shame that IMDB won´t include an algorithm to sort out such wanna-be hordes from the ratings system.",20 January 2020
"Writing all these negative reviews? That would make perfect sense. But ...

Bashing Discovery will not in any way help the Orville become a better show. It sure won't magically make it more original! Go back to focusing on Fam Guy, please? Such a better use of your talent!",17 April 2020

"Google translation

I do not know about you, but Michael Burnham, as the main actress, got tired. Her attitude, emotions, clamor, something, someone, a walking messiah everywhere. You do not feel the hierarchy of command, as if everyone around you was a small background for her.

This is not Star Trek, it is not about dilemmas, I do not show the specialty of each of the crew members, it is a series about Burnham dilemmas, which takes everything on its shoulders (which tried to knock Spock out of his head) and on this principle, on this belief, he claims the right to be everywhere, to interfere in everything and above all: constant opposition to everything and everyone, shouting (of course in jazgocie): I still do this, I still want to do it, I will do it differently, another 5 minutes. And her emotional manipulations integrated into character, it rarely happens to sell something like that. She is not a scientific officer, she is everything in everything.

I watched all Star Trek series, even TOS animations, and there during the watching man rested, relaxed, laughed, cried, learned something new. And Discovery with such a crew, with this system of thinking, the hierarchy of command, probably would not have the chance to survive five minutes in a difficult cosmos. In the world of Burnham, she will survive, but it's like a utopia of her brain that she designs on others.",31 March 2019
"I've watched since I was a kid, and as each new series came out I watched with the same reservations, gradually conquered as the characters grew. This is a modern Star Trek, and it has to be. The world has changed and intelligent television has to change with it.

The visuals are stunning, and very different to the past. No longer a slow panning star ship or a cardboard planet, but fast and confusing as space should be. The crew are growing on me. I don't like Lorca, but I think we're meant not to. It'll be hard for his crew to stay loyal if he stays as a warrior instead of an explorer. Burnham is fantastic. Deeply flawed, feeling her way back into Starfleet, doesn't know where she's headed but determined to bide by Starfleet principles. Saru, Stannet and Tilly are going to be stars. The cute doctor too.

I don't like the Klingons much either.

I'm giving it a firm chance. I understand that many hold a vision in their head of their Star Trek. If this isn't it, well, I'm sorry. But it fits my view of Star Trek, and it dumps many of the worst aspects of the old Trek. It always annoyed me when a plea to reason from Kirk or Picard ended some conflict that had lasted millennia. I don't expect that to happen on Discovery.",19 October 2017
"Let me start out by trying to give an idea of how i feel about this show so far. It's like what would happen if Wing Commander's writer, Chris Roberts, was given free reign on a Star Trek script. Certainly a weird combo but so far it's worked out much better than expected.

I'm going to be honest here, I had very little faith that this show would be much better, if at all, than a dumpster fire. I've heard people criticize it left and right, I've heard the complaints about political correctness. I do have to say though, it's no where near as bad as people are saying. It's certainly not a conventional star trek, it's got weird story pacing, a slow start, but I do like where it is going. To be fair I've only seen up to episode 5 so far so I can't be confident I'll feel the same by the end but I'm putting 3 to 2 odds on my review score staying the same.",22 February 2023
"I will agree with some of the reviewers. There IS a lot of hate for this show. Most of it probably stems from MEN not liking a female lead, the coarse language, and the LGBT content.

My review is simple. Despite the darker and more TV-MA tone, the core of Star Trek is there. That being hope, friendship, and discovery (no pun intended.) Yes they swear some in the show and there's some graphic violence, but it feels like the right direction for the franchise. This show, especially by the end of season 1, really surprised me that it maintains the spirit of Star Trek. I wish Star Wars would learn that trick from this show.

Gonna finish season 2 and 3 in time for season 4, and really excited!!!",2 September 2021
"One e second season very good,third season really boring and i don't understand why ,i can't do It worse",8 January 2021
"Was hoping for far more.

There is no characterisation , we are hardly introduced to any of the interesting ""family"" of characters that were all part of the original - how sad and that is what kills it right from the beginning.

Who chose to cast a relative unknown and named her Michael for some reason - female to placate all the feminists and lesbian brigade - yes we can all see the reason its seems Hollywood is having to cast black and ethnic actors as well due to all the hullabaloo from the LGBT and BLM morons - if so then why didn't they cast a decent black actress (how about Danai Gurira or even Kellita Smith) as most of the actors are really, really poor - Makes me even wish Janeway was back. Succumbing to the liberal left seems to be destroying TV if not civilisation itself. If that isn't bad enough , even the ""Ginger nut"" politically correct hair colour brigade had to include a terribly incompetent red haired actress as a foil for ""Michael"" but she just comes across as an extremely irritating tw>t and not at all like the excellent Mrs Borg 7 of 9 from Voyager.

To be fair I did like the new Klingon design but the CGI feels very compressed as though it is in a very small field of vision and not in a vast universe and for some reason the effects remind me of the old (and excellent) Stargate Atlantis but even it looked better. Some folks have even suggested the program is racist against the muslims by portraying the Klingons as warlike, destructive calliphate! Being as politcially correct as it is, the most politically correct program i have now seen I would seriously doubt this!

After two episodes we are then thrown into a Ridley Scott version of Alien set aboard an abandoned Starship which to me was so lame! It was done far better even in the SPACE 1999 episode ""Dragons Domain"" which terrified me for years and even still does 50 years later it is still better than this episode.

Sadly i doubt it will make a season 2 and defecates on all the great Roddenberry stuff that came before with the possible exception of the dire DS9.

I had to add a couple of other things - adding gay scenes and lesbians, the ""f"" word and the usual having to include a Pakistani Muslim, more black folks and more female members just sucks its so full of placating the PC liberal wonkers it makes a real Trekkies blood boil - everyone i talked to were disgusted with the ""f"" word - part of what makes Star Trek what it is the fact that humans had evolved but the foul language really spits on Gene Roddenberry. Its as if they had a list prepared by the liberal wonk brigade, LGBT and BLM loons and went along with it - It has totally destroyed the franchise IMHO

Also what is even more unforgivable is the change in the music and intro titles which is so obviously ripped off from the new series of Westworld they couldn't even keep that original and went and stole someone else work. So much for the future!

Setting it before the original Star Trek is a mistake as it looks technically light years ahead of even the later series Voyager and Picard which also makes it hard for us oldies to accept it!

Casting director should be fired and characterisation have destroyed what could have been a very interesting reboot!",8 October 2017
"So far, just three episodes in, Star Trek: Discovery is an intriguing and fascinating successor to the Trek universe. Its characters are morally complex while still being recognizably noble and moral and possessing the core qualities of ""Star Trek"" officers. The struggle of the lead character, Michael Burnham is fascinating - a women who does something that she believes is the right course of action, even though it leads to terrible consequences - mostly for her. Her willingness to follow a course of action for the greater good, despite the unavoidable costs to herself, is a selfless act, even if the action itself is highly controversial.

For Trek fanatics, the fact that this show supposedly takes place in regular Trek continuity will present some problems. The ships are bigger, more advanced, and use far superior technology than the original series shows. Even the design of the bridges on the ships is extraordinary and, while beautiful and captivating, does not sit well with the established canon. Some of this is necessary updating, given modern attitudes (no more female officers running around in micro-skirts) and improvements in our own technology (the use of hologram communication, for example, which is not far off in the real world). But it does make the show feel that it is taking place later than the original series. Indeed, given how much time lies between the original series and ST: TNG, it may have been more logical to put this series in that interim period. Even the idea of the dissolution of the Klingon Empire would have fit neatly with the events of the movie ""Star Trek: the Undiscovered Country.""",1 October 2017
Dont agree at all with the others who think it doesnt do the Star trek family justice.,14 April 2018
"Long time Trekker here, I legitimately don't understand the hate this show gets. Just finished the first season and each episode is riveting. The makeup is astonishing on Doug Jones who is a pleasure as always. The Klingons for the first time actually look and sound not only legitimately hostile, but actually alien.

Great cast, interesting story with twists and turns. Top notch animation for a tv show, and a quality entry into Star Trek.",16 September 2020
"Found this show interesting and have actually watched all episodes, but really do all the characters need to be part of the LGBTQABCXYZ community. They kind of went overboard on the whole woke thing also. I also just found out I wasted by time watching this series because the failed Georgia Democrat Governor candidate is called the President of Earth, come on.",19 March 2022
"I absolutley loved the first season. Jason Isaacs and Michelle Yeo... outstanding. Great story arc. Season 2 was not as good but ok. Then season 3 was bad and 4 has totally stunk.

When I came to this review and Star Trek I grew up watching the show since TNG but Star Trek discovery is my second favor of the series it has a Game of Thrones mentality where thing don't always end and people died overall it is an excellent Show,15 June 2019
"I disagree, I'm at season 1 episode 11.

It gets better, like GOT gotta go past season 1 and it is action packed, if you enjoyed Star Trek with Chris Pine, this is definitely similar.

I am a fan of Star Trek Voyager, Chris Pine Star Trek 1 , The Orville and some S.Trek Next generation.",8 March 2019
"As per Gene Roddenberry's many interviews in the 70's Star Trek was a vision of what the future could be. The perfections of society and people today were not existent in the future. Of course, we can pick out the flaws in the proposed future, but they were far less than what society was in the 60's, y0's, and even now. It was not a mirror of the societal problems we had at that time although most episodes were making a statement on society at that time.

We saw that in the third season Gene was not able to fight the push for imperfection as he had in the first 2 seasons. We still witnessed the fight going on in the early part of STNG when he was still alive, but that all changed when Rick Berman took over. I do have to congratulate him on trying to maintain the balance of ST vs the Corporate influence. In later versions we saw more of that influence affecting the series and movies. It was a sharp edge that they were playing between Gene's vision and Corporate greed.

Greed, or their perceived need to revive the vision to keep it profitable and in the publics eye won out. How much the revival was actually needed is open to debate.

The original fan base know they could use the template for future stories. Any good writer could see that. Unfortunately, ST writers were not the best or had a limited vision of what could be done with the original concept. Additionally, the PC culture had infected the administration of ST and demanded realistic characters with flaws. The flaws of the original characters were enough. The whole point of ST is to show how we got over our ""flaws."" The younger generation cannot comprehend this and infected ST with its view of letting it all hang out.

What is really surprising is that the hippies of the generation were the ones that started the laid back and let everything hang out fad. Many of them appreciated the idea that we were past the social ills of the time. They saw a vision in it that the younger generation of today have missed.

Today's ST in any form is not about how we have succeeded in the future. It is a visual mirror of our failures and how we stills struggle with today's problems then and how devastating it will be in the future. ST started out as a vision of hope and an ideal to shoot for. Today's ST is a vision of failure and hopelessness. It is a view of how low we can sink.

Anyone who wants to succeed shoots for a goal higher than what they can attain. If they reach it great, if not they know they'll be higher than they are now. As they get closer to the goal they raise it higher, ever improving themselves. Each succeeding ST has lowered the bar and we are watching a franchise sink into the merky depths of the sewer bringing all the ills of society to the screen.

Lastly, this should be called the Michael Burnham show. It all revolves around one character which is dynamically opposed to ST concept.",17 November 2021
"Star Trek: The Next Generation, Star Trek: Voyager, and Star Trek: Enterprise told a lot of weak stories and many of them were the same only slightly altered. How many times did we get a story where the entire story never happened because of some clever time travel nonsense? Boring! At least Deep Space Nine had a slightly serialized story and the Dominion War showed how good Star Trek could be. Bold story telling. Big ideas. Real drama.

Well look no further because Star Trek: Discovery is telling a big story, highly imperfect characters, high drama, great visuals and sets, and a story that slowly and beautifully unfolds. No it is not perfect. But it is very great.

I think the best part is that we're seeing characters that are not so perfect, that are willing to bend or break the rules like Kirk and Spock did, and do what is necessary to go from A to B.",14 October 2017
I enjoyed the sets and CGI some of the script was lacking but still better than all but the original series,15 April 2018
"First impression: good job. Second impression: overfilled with feminism. Just TOO much. No problem with girls being great, but when it is TOO much, it becomes annoying, as if it were the main idea rather than Star Trek theme. Plus, if this is a prequel, then I doubt that it had been so feminist and then suddenly stopped being that by the time when the time line approached the Star Trek as we know it. I don't remember USS Enterprise and later ships having it on board. This point is very non- sequitur.",24 September 2017

But this ? Bad...very bad. Watch the first half of episode one and then watch the last 30 minutes of the last one.

You won't have to go through the pain of watching the rest cause it's bad.

I hate all the characters except Reno. She's funny and sarcastic.

But the rest is bad. Might be Star Trek but it ain't good. Web episodes of Star Trek continues are way better.",18 March 2022
"But reading down a few more of the negative reviews sort of put things in perspective for me. One reviewer writes: ""I used my free month of Netflix to watch this ..."" then something about it being a waste.

But they left a hateful, LOOOOONG review just the same.",17 April 2020
"I Love Star Strek and for the most part this series is in many areas the best TV adaptation version. The CGI is amazing for the most part, storylines are well thought out, consistent, they meander well from episode to episode! Doug Jones and Michelle Yeoh are really excellent. Unfortunately the worst thing IMO is the lead character Sonequa, in Season 3 she overacts nearly every episode to the point I want to turn it off. Maybe it's just me and I'm overreacting about it, but it feels kinda forced. Hopefully she will be 20% less emotional next season",15 January 2021

"a very good introduction to the show, yes it don't feel like the older star trek same as new generation didn't feel like the classic star trek,but rather gave it a new taste. in my opinion the actors are great and very fit to the show specially Sonequa Martin she did a very good job on her role. for the Klingons yes they changed them a lot the same way that they changed them in new generation and now they look better and very fitting to there updated characteristic. guys please give it a chance the show is in it beginning.",2 October 2017
"This show is unafraid. It does not fear change. It does not fear new ideas. It does not fear taking its viewers out of their comfort zones, even if some of those viewers don't want to be. It's darker than classic trek. I like that. Despite the dark cast of the show, there are many rays of positivity, and I appreciate these positive moments more because of the darkness. I love the new Klingons. They're actually scary for a change. The old ones were campy and not believable as warriors at all. There are a lot of discrepancies from canon, but unlike others, it only make me more interested. I'm genuinely curious to see how they'll tie it together so it meshes with the prime universe. A bold new step which I hope will go on for at least seven seasons.",24 November 2017
"The Good: Special effects, costumes, and set design are all really on point as a whole.

The Bad: If this were set in the JJ Abrams movie timeline it would make a lot more sense. Things make little canonical sense for it to be in the so called ""Prime"" timeline.

The Klingon design is...not for me. I would have been happier if they had invented a new race and kept this appearance for that new race.

The possibly redeemable: Dialogue seems very much like someone was just reading off of a cue card. Additionally. whoever wrote it seems to have decided it was much better to have people just spew facts out rather than trust the audience to be shown some things. Given the rumors of rewrites and delays on set hopefully the dialogue is something they can work out and find their rhythm.

Overall: Some nerd cred issues are there and make me doubt their claim that they had an entire team to make sure everything synced up with TOS canon. That being said the show has potential and the cast are far better actors than what they were given to work with in these episodes. So with any luck and some improved dialogue I can definitely see this show becoming an excellent addition to Star Trek that will, hopefully, be able to revive the franchise.",24 September 2017
"I'm admittedly not the world's biggest Trekkie, but I'm hardly casual either; I've been dabbling on in off to various degrees in recent years & have very much enjoyed the majority of content. I'm baffled by the vitriol with which people attacked this show before, during, & still after the first season aired.

Star Trek has always been a progressive show filled with progressive ideals, it has always reflected the spirit of the time (as well as the format of whatever was popular on TV on that time). Discovery is no different, to call it some outlandish Social Justice Warrior propaganda machine is insane. The format of the episodes is closer to a Game of Thrones, which I can understand some people being annoyed a little by, but not enough to hate the thing's existence.

Discovery is not the greatest show ever made, & the delivery service was definitely a bit of a disaster, but the hyperbole surrounding this show is so over-the-top. It's a good show. Highs & lows like most prestige TV in the 2010s, but the highs are very high indeed.

The thing that more people need to realize is that, just like with the unhinged angry mob reactions to The Last Jedi, the problem is with the viewers. They've fallen prey to the desperate anti-PC machinations that pervade society, they've been infected with a kind of disease that makes them see ""SJW"" in anything that neither explicitly caters to their newfound views nor is completely neutral to the point of banality.

Every 2/10 or 1/10 review on this page needs to be taken with gallons of salt.",5 April 2018
"I think there's a lot of butthurt anti-pc gamergate white guys who seem to particularly dislike this series (as well as the new ghostbusters and anything else like it). The truth is the show is a little PC (for me not as bad as Deep Space Nine), and maybe a little aimed at teens (like the new star wars), but it's okay. For the week I watched it, I looked forward to coming home from work and putting it on. There's some unique concepts, a bit of star trek heart, great production quality. It's only flaw is it's not as strong on character, although I liked some of them. Maybe the characterisation is a bit generic, never getting beyond hollywood and YA tropes into properly star trek & sci fi territory. But if you were an honest person and not a little snotty gamer-bro you'd probably give this series five-seven stars, not zero.",3 February 2019
"Let's remain cautiously optimistic! The main character is an annoying Mary-Sue, but still salvagable. The supporting characters are interesting but underdeveloped. The plot of the first season is awful, but the second season shows some promise: more exploring, more stand-alone episodes. The comedy needs to improve. Getting sneezed in the face by a reptilan officer is not funny. Imitating the Orville badly is worse than the usual StarTrek-humor :-) The klingons didn't need to be 're-imagined' as a cross of the Uruk-hai and the Xindi-reptilians. The klingon political elements were slightly interesting though. The writers seem to want to add Superhero-movie- and Starwars-elements. That's okay, because the new fans like that, but they also seem to forget the values of StarTrek and that is unforgivable. It's not terrible, but it needs to improve quickly to gain my heart. (And don't pay for it. CBS has to learn somehow. :-(",21 January 2019
"Regarding the main female character Michael Burnham's name - there have been females called Michael in history - the woman who was the mum in the Waltons was called Michael Learned in real life, as was a member of The Bangles, Michael Steele. People saying the character in STD must be transgender and moaning about it are beyond stupid - apart from the fact it shows you the character as a little girl in flashbacks so unless she 'changed' at the age of 5, she isn't - not that it would even matter but please get your facts right. That aside, Episode 3 takes this show on a new twist I am looking forward to seeing. I liked it.",3 October 2017
"No kidding I fall asleep each time I am watching this. I liked season 1 it was decent. Then season 2 was ok. Season 3 and 4 are unwatchable. The only good characters were Filipa as the emperor, The captains in season 1 and 2 but now they are gone. Michael is a very weak character I can't watch her. Saru is ok and Tilly is annoying. The rest of the crew are pretty boring and lacking depth. This is nothing to compare to past characters like Picard, Reiker, Warf, Data, Troy, Beverly, Jordi...",24 December 2021
"I've never been into Star Trek before. I've seen an episode here and there and it's always intrigued me, but I couldn't handle the old school effects and some of the really dated stereotypes. But THIS show made me love the Star Trek universe. The first season is slow to get started, it's a little sluggish and painful for the first half season, but stick with it because it gets SO GOOD from about two-thirds of the way through and just keeps improving from there.

It is SO well written, it never falls into any of the typical story traps, and the characters are complex, funny, smart and engaging. I cannot speak highly enough of it. I have no idea why people are giving it such poor ratings. I can only assume it's fans of the original or Next Generation who don't love the characters.

Don't believe the bad ratings. It's amazing. Especially if you're not a fan of Star Trek. I'm going back to discover next generation and the original. Star Trek fans, if you want to convert someone, tell them to watch this first.",15 April 2022
"I don't understand all the hate for this show. I've been watching Star Trek since the 80's and I've seen basically every episode or movie related to Star Trek yet I don't see why people are so upset.

The second (or third episode?) was great and had me looking forward to more. I like how we get to see Star Trek done in a more dramatic way. The action is good, the aliens are awesome, the science is awe inspiring...what more could you want?

If you're looking for Star Trek The Next Generation to come back then too bad but be prepared to be just as entertained and just as wowed.",6 October 2017
"First of all: I am a Trekker for about 30 years now... I have every series, every episode at home, so I can say I know what I am talking about.

First of all: I have the impression many Stark Trek ""Fans"" think they are ""better"" fans then others by reducing the shows potential. This is human behavior so I can of course understand, but setting this *** aside:

The series has a LOT of potential and this is what counts in the first 2 episodes. Think about the first episode TNG: Number 1 please dock the saucer section. OK you did it, end of episode... man really This was the kind of episodes we got in the 80s 90s and we loved it. Why because we were ***ng 30 years younger...

Back to discovery: Acting & Plot. The first 2 episodes had a fast pace, very, very good acting and without any doubt, I want to see more. yes of course, since the episodes have cliffhangers they are very different from what we are used to see from star trek, so it is more like Game of Thrones story telling, but this is not something bad.

Visual Effects: In word word: Stunning. I have never seen a series with such an art like picture and visual effects. And I have seen a LOT. Of course I have a very, very big TV, but my wife and I we just sat there and were stunned.

All in all: Keep going and I hope it will not be canceled.",26 September 2017
"I'm not sure what happened in season 3 and it seems I am not alone judging by the episode reviews people are submitting. The thing that makes good shows good, (and made this show so enjoyable) is interesting characters, in-depth storylines and articulate writing. Season 1 & 2 had this in abundance, thus the popularity it has gained.

I must say that I enjoyed the initial premise of the new Season (3), but it just didn't grab hold of the huge potential it offered or explore any themes that were interesting. Instead it insisted on driving its own social agenda down your neck until suffocation, whilst simultaneously offering absolutely nothing in story driven narrative or entertainment.

Huge shame but I hope that maybe the writers steer this wayward vessel back in the right direction for season 4; here's hoping.",11 March 2021
"This series has most of the basic elements of Star Trek, but it is not a series Trekkies would expect to carry the traditional passion for adventure and discovery; The name ""Discovery"" should be changed to ""Touchy Feely"" as it focuses more on the situations and relations between the diverse characters rather than focus the characters on diverse situations, This series is nothing more than a long-winded, gloried soap opera with great special efx. I lost interest before the end of the 3rd season, and by the second episode of Season 4, it became unbearable to watch. I gave it four stars only because they have great sets and CGI.",9 December 2021
"I have never considered Star Trek to be true Science Fiction because in the past, it has deliberately avoided or, worse still, fecklessly skirted relevant topics like ethnicity, religion, gender.

Don't get me wrong, I have always admired the spirit behind Trek's staple mission, which was to engage and entertain an audience at a level that was both comfortable and upbeat; however, Trek never fully trusted its audience to cope with the depiction of a less idealized future that could truly resemble one that could one day come to pass.

For 50 years, we have had nice uniforms, British accents and the politically correct, slightly sub-human characters representing minority groups that were meant to ""make us appreciate being human"".

Incredibly relevant topics like religion were casually tossed aside.

""400 years before that, you were murdering each other in quarrels over tribal god images!"" - Q.; Encounter at Farpoint Station

Here was a franchise where practically every single character had their allegiance and belief system blindly determined by their ""race"". All Cardassians were imperialistic and slightly right of Franco; Ferengi were simply extensions of anti-Semitic caricatures, right down to a pronounced facial attribute (ears instead of noses; nagus instead of magus).

From what I have seen so far, this latest incarnation isn't afraid to dirty its hands, and get close and personal with the uglier and less clinical aspects of the human condition.

However, this realism demands more of its audience in processing and drawing internal conclusions on what they are being presented with, which, combined with the casting, allows me to hope for a series that takes us on a different type of journey that is more inline with our present day reality than ever before.",27 September 2017
"Well, it turns out she makes an awful Captain, Janeway would eat her alive. Her acting is as wooden as it comes. As to the other characters, I love the weird red-head roommate of ""Michael's"". Plot is contrived and it's definitely not character building related like STNG nor STDS9, this is totally action-oriented to please the younger audience. Not my favorite ST show, nonetheless watchable.",5 November 2017
"Season one was great. New, interesting and engaging.

Season two was still pretty good. Not quite as new but the path the season two took from problem to its solution was interesting.

Season three was a bit boring. Starts to get a tad too much into character arcs and is teetering on the edge of becoming more soap opera than sci-fi. However, there was a decent enough sci-fi story to keep me still somewhat engaged. Season 3 was about 50/50... half the episodes were just all talk between characters about their emotions and boring, while the other half was focused more on ""the Burn"" and that storyline.

Season four is REALLY, really, boring and all ""emotional junk"" storylines. They've COMPLETELY lost the thread. Any sci-fi or space-related storylines are COMPLETELY secondary. It's now an emotional drama ... they may as well be on a cruise ship in the Atlantic rather than space. 2 minutes of CGi in every 42 minute episode does not make for a sci-fi series. Seriously... a cruise ship in the Atlantic and someone on board is throwing things and people overboard.... they have to figure out who is doing the throwing ... could be the SAME SHOW for season 4.

The driving factor of the first few seasons, especially season one, was the anti-Starfleet Starfleet officer. The anti-establishment aspect which Michael Burnum represented was a fresh, new, take on the ""world"" of Star Trek.

By season 4 Burnam now a captain and no longer a mutineer or fringe-based character. Heck, they've given much of that aspect (although minimally) to a secondary character (Book) for the most part. I find myself fast forwarding through 90% of the season 4 episodes.. they are all talk talk talk talk talk (bit of CGI) talk talk talk. I mean for heaven's sake there was an entire episode in season 4 with diplomats standing around a table and talking.... that was the episode! Seriously??? Who responsible for this series thinks that's a good choice for a sci-fi series?

I fail to recall episodes of the original series, or the first couple subsequent reboots, where entire episodes were devoted to talking, and then more talking, followed by talking, and then talking about the ""emotional well being"" of a character or two. Maybe I'm merely mis-remembering. That's not generally how I perceive Star Trek on the whole.. After watching episode 6 of season 4.. where even the COMPUTER has an ""emotional junk"" storyline.... I've about given up.

While there have always been ""character moments"" in any of the series, the episodes have still been 80% a sci-fi storyline with secondary character plots. Discovery has gone WAY off course. STD is now running a close second to the horrible soap-opera-like emotional character episodes which Deep Space Nine used so prevalently. I, for one, can't stand these character arcs.. I DON'T CARE that much about fictional characters. I watch for sci-fi... if I wanted emotional studies I'd go watch Dr Phil. If these writers/producers/directors want to sell a sci-fi series they need to stop writing ""Dawson's Creek"" style episodes.

If season 4 is not the final season, I seriously doubt I'll be anticipating viewing season 5.",24 December 2021
Finally a star trek show that gets the Hollywood treatment that so many other Sci fi shows get. With a Trek heart and Trek feel this show is the best trek series since TNG.,11 July 2021
"Other reviews have suggested that the technology displayed in this series does not reflect its place in the Star Trek timeline. I'd like to point out that the original series, produced in the 60s, showed the technology as well as was possible with the budget and the effects available at the time. The lack of hologram communication on Enterprise in the original series is explained by Captain Pike's aversion to it and it's subsequent removal from the ship. Also, the lack of knowledge of the special drive (no spoilers), in other Star Trek series that are set later than Discovery, is dealt with at the end of season 2 Now that's out of the way, the actual review: in my opinion the first two seasons were amazing in terms of character development and filmography/effects. The storylines are excellent, however the finale of season 1 felt a little rushed and perhaps even flippant in its regard to what had gone before. The space battles are amazing in their scope and detail. Season 3 has, so far (I'm only part way through), far and away surpassed the first two seasons and has brought the Discovery into completely uncharted territory, which is exciting and suspenseful. Love it!",6 September 2021
"The second year was better than first, i wait for the third :)",24 April 2019
"The first episode did have some issues, but I do really enjoy the interplay of the crew and the cohesiveness of the actors. The visual was stunning and hoping for good story development.

That said, I may never find out. Paying an arm and a leg for cable already and three other streaming services (which is about to get cut). Despite my devotion to Star Trek, I'm depleted of the energy to pay and set up yet another streaming service.

It's too bad, because this show has a lot of promise and I may not see it come to fruition.

"I have been a Trekkie all my life and have watched every single episode and movie some with awe and others with patience. What this instalment is doing is bringing the whole franchise forward in terms of story telling, character connectivity and a beautiful link to the whole canon and storyline.

Michael is your everyday person abs I believe people, like me, will connect with her on many levels. Keep it up CBS",6 November 2020
I'm a Trek fan and I like the first 2 season. I can't stand Michael Burnham in season 3 anymore. This show is all about her being overly emotional about everything.,7 December 2020
After watching many YouTube reviews on Star Trek discovery it made me not want to watch the series at all. I recently watch the whole season 1 beginning to end and I must say it was phenomenal. I was wrong for basing my judgment of watching it on other people's reviews. It was a great first season and I hope the second is better I just pray that they don't do to the second season of discovery what they did to the second season of The Expanse!,16 September 2018
I appreciate exciting and new directions unlike any thing star trek has done before and has many talented actors that help me connect to this interesting story.,6 February 2018
"Loved it!!

What i think i'm finding incredibly amusing with some of the negative reviews, is how much everyone is upset because things are different? like they need it to be exactly like the original series for them to appreciate it?? really?? Hate to break it to you all, TNG got the same response when it first came out. exactly the same... And to those who were expecting it to bring you back to the 60's or 80's versions, so you can relive your childhood is utterly ridiculous to expect. this franchise owes you nothing... as i'm sure if they just duplicated everything and simply changed the situation and surroundings, you'd whine about that too. I think it's safe to assume most of the whiners would whine regardless if this was great or garbage, ultimately they've put the franchise on such a high pedestal that nothing will ever satisfy them. so pay no attention to their reviews as they are all clearly unrealistic. If you think the nature of trek was all about exploration then you have a very selective memory, as DS9 was ALL about war... Voyager more or less was too, both had zero exploration. There was plenty of war in the original series too. again, people only seem to remember what they want to.

For me, i'm so glad Trek is back and it appears to be done very well too. Excellent storyline, great cast, who cares if it does fall perfectly snug into the Trek universe, really the only one that does is Star Trek TOS, this sticks pretty darn close to the cannon. To to those whining about the look of the Klingon's, get over it, you're truly overthinking it. To quote a fan post on another site "" Star Trek: Enterprise. The two episodes, ""Affliction"" and ""Divergence"", aired in February 2005. An earlier story arc featured the Augments, genetically-engineered humans left over from the Eugenics Wars of the late 20th century, and who were defeated by Captain Jonathan Archer and the Enterprise in Klingon space. The Klingon High Council fears that Starfleet was developing armies of Augments; after gaining access to genetic material from the Augments, the Klingons perform experiments to increase their own intellect and strength. The experiments turn disastrous when a flu strain mutates and becomes a deadly plague that spreads across the Empire, causing physical changes resulting in the afflicted bearing a TOS-era appearance. Dr. Phlox of the Enterprise formulates a cure for the virus, but the physical alterations remain in the populace and are inherited by offspring. Phlox indicated that ""someday"" the physical alterations could be reversed.""

so get over it, lol...

I liked this from the start and the characters, perhaps not so much the Klingons, but it makes me yern for the next episode here in the UK.

"In short, this is a great series and a good Star Trek series. Maybe in some time, when the nostalgia filter comes in, this will be a great Star Trek one too. But all the elements are there. And btw, whoever criticize the presence of diversity, female leaders etc. Never understood Star Trek and it's philosophy, at all. And who complains, that today it was too obvious, too woke.

I'll admit it took me a few episodes to get into the new series but I've been hooked ever since in a way I never was with Voyager for example which just re-hashed all the familiar Trek themes + ideas that had been covered previously . Discovery tries (and succeeds in my opinion) to do something new + different in a way which brings it up to date and makes it more relevant to our times . Roll on season 2 and more suprises :-)",5 March 2018
I know it is treky enough for purist but of all the latest star trek. ( Picard season 1 ep. 1 to 6 and 2 seasons of Discovery) I find myself liking Discovery season 1 the most for it's originality.

IF you have a problem with that, try to keep nitpick whatever you will to suit your pathetic prejudices but deep down you know you are unworthy of this genre that includes ALL.

I find myself constantly moving fast forward to where any of the action scenes are.. We got such a great opportunity with a new universe where you can write literally anything, and most of each episode is focused on an emotional blubber from a leading role with mommy issues going rogue all the time..

"In much the same way that the new Battlestar Galactica re-imagined it's source material, STD (I know, right!) is a re-imaging of the Star Trek Universe. It is fraught with the same issues of melodrama, the same issues of personal character arcs being waylaid by impressive visuals, and the use of the 'plot twist' to drive the story rather than genuine revealing insights, but, you what, I don't care. In an era where science fiction seems to be lacking in breath and scope, where the more interesting shows are based around real world problems (ie; Black Mirror, Mr. Robot, etc.) it is nice to return to a wholly fictional world and let yourself be subsumed by it. This is speculative sci-fi lite, in that the core concepts are about the story more than they are about the science that it is based upon, and I like it. I don't love it, but I am thoroughly enjoying the overall feel of the show.",7 February 2018
"As a MASSIVE 'Star Trek' fan ... From Kirk's first steps, to TNG, DS9, VOY, & even ENT which all had their merits... I was so looking forward to a new outlook on the Trek Universe.

Alas, from the first episode of Discovery, with a Starship that looked like a 4 yr old had drawn it, to the completely unrealistic and unbelievable crew, and plotlines that only a burntout 'cabbage' could come up with. It went down hill so fast I had a nose bleed!

"I enjoyed it. Have to admit, is not about space exploration but war and character. Still, it is quite good. In the last (or one but last) episode of season 2 you get to learn why is it called ""discovery"". Someone complained about the title, I think it is spot on, pay attention to what the Captain says.

The 1-4 point rating reviews are simply wrong, it is much higher quality than that.

The effects and the environment are amazing. So much, that I've actually had trouble going back and watching older Star Trek series. I understand that the actual content and/or the actors might be better, but the film technology gap has been too big for me, stopped after a few minutes.

Anyway, I liked season 2 even more then season 1. It sometimes drags the drama a bit too long, but I've just skipped those parts... and then went back and watched them because I felt that I missed something.

It is always hard for me when I finish a series.I get confused, I don't understand why my world stopped spinning. Finishing Star Trek: Discovery hit me particularly hard. I still can't find my place and want to go on watching. I think this is an indication of the quality of the show.",2 August 2020
"What a great show! Diversity (of background, experience, education, sex, gender, religion, sexual orientation and much more) and compassion towards your subordinates are fundamental pillars of leadership and team cohesion success.

This show does a great job illustrating this, and includes all the Star Trek space adventure you can poke a stick at right along with it. The characters are fully fleshed out, with background histories and full personalities. The show presents both the personal and professional lives of the crew and how (just like in real life) they intermingle to affect one another.

It's wonderful to see modern leadership styles being portrayed in popular culture, rather than the prehistoric notion that leaders must be bullies, using aggression and intimidation, to be 'strong'.

I am thoroughly enjoying the show. I hope it continues for many seasons.",5 May 2022

"I've provided many movies and series ratings, but I've never written a review, but after seeing the first four episodes of star trek discovery, I've decided to do it now, I've read many of the other reviews people have made and I've come to the conclusion, most people either hate the series because it's too far from the real Star Trek, or they love it for just the same reason, but none of them really got any idea about what the series really is. :)

I saw the first and second episode, I did not actually think much about them, there were no people I really did care about, and the Klingons was completely wrong, but I decided to give the series a chance, so i watched the third episode too, the episode was okay i believe, but there were still no people I was particularly into, and I could not really remember what the episode was about and what happened in it, when I started watching the fourth episode.

Around 20 minutes into the fourth episode I had enough, and I was ready to stop watching the series, a series with some Klingons, who all the time seems to be almost scared to death, and look like they all are close to crying.

Suddenly something happened and I saw the light :) A Klingon that seemed to be terrified and very close to crying she (I believe it was a she, but I may have been mistaken) Anyway: She interrupted another real scared Klingon, and a Klingon who looked almost not scared, she did it to stop a chick fight/cat fight, and she even came with a quick remark, (it all did happened in a kind of slow motion, that's the speed most things in the series now seem to be running in, if not everything is completely stopped, I have never seen so quiet and cultivated Klingons, and they almost never raise there voices above silent whisper) Well, anyway the female Klingons? (it's hard to find out who i who among them) Her quick remark i believe was something about that the thing she had in her hands was ready, and after the remark she gave the thing to the not so afraid Klingon.

Then it came what had to be my revelation, the female? Klingon, she/he? walked calmly over to some food, and took something that looked like a chicken leg, took a cautious bite, came with a sound that sounded almost like a puppy trying to growl, and then I suddenly could see the fun in the series. I have now found out that although it's not a good Star Trek Series, it's going to be a pretty damn good parody, I now is looking forward to the next episode to see what the not so fearless, and the almost crying Klingons is doing of new funny stuff.

"I was not too impressed with season 1 the show was a bit cold characters especially the captain at the end was not great un very uninteresting, also redoing the same old war with the Klingons along with subtitles made me almost not want to watch season two. Same old same old very boring. But if you can bring yourself to overlook the fact this is rewriting the star trek story and cannot explain why the other past shows did not have the technology that was invented in this show then you may fall in love with season two. First of the captain change was excellent (great acting by Anson Mount), almost like bring back captain kirk and we have the younger spock back. The story has changed for the better, with out giving away the plot this season brings what I think skyfi should be. Great plot keeping you on the edge of your seat and excited to watch the next episode. I agree with most poor reviews on here for season one but season two so far is excellent and I hope they keep up this story writing. Great to see start trek back on tv again I love it.",23 March 2019
"I, like many others, tuned into the first episode with all the longing a staunch fan could have for familiar doo-dads with new stories and wonderful characters, only to be stumped with incorrect technologies, uniforms, and Klingons. Then I see the amazing Michelle Yeoh being killed off and yelling at the TV to bring back an amazing actress who would undoubtedly make an awesome Captain and addition to the series. I almost turned it off and gave up right there. What next - Warp 18? I have grown to like Sonequa Martin-Green and Jason Isaacs in their roles, but I hope Saru steps out an air-lock. But I have finally figured it out. This is in fact our beloved Star Trek but from one of those darn alternate universes where it does not matter which facts are wrong because everything is different over there in universe #27. I like the series but am absolutely flabbergasted as to how anyone would design a TV with so much history and story line already laid out for them, and then get so much of it wrong, unless of course they forgot to name the show properly. It's proper name is ""Star Trek: Discovery from Universe #27""",17 November 2017
"Commander Burnham must have taken acting exams in whispering.

The whole thing is: *CGI (like watching a computer game) *Soap opera (a bad one) *Masses of gore and unnecessary violence (very coy and careful about sex, but no make-up spared when it comes to death and destruction *WHISPERING *Personality changes (goes alongside the ever changing - being written as it goes along ""storyline"") *Slow, stretched-out episodes (enough in 4 episodes for 1 episode) ^Everything is 'edge of the seat' or some sort of cliffhanger *Something for/about everyone (every box is ticked) *A quite big dependence on different coloured contact lenses *Roving ""fly on the wall"" style camera work *Dozens of ""messages"" Oh and did I mention, Burnham's incessant whispering.

Overall 2/10 is generous

It is more like yet another load of Super Hero films than Star Trek.",6 January 2023
"As a lifelong Trekkie, I've been starving for new Trek on TV for years. I loved Enterprise (having watched it on Netflix in order, as it has to be seen) and I agree that this new series had to be radically different than all the previous series which were all extrapolations of TNG, at least in look and feel. I love the dark feel of Discovery. I love the shift in focus to a non-captain. And I LOVE the character Saru. I admit I'm annoyed with the Klingons; not a fan, not yet anyway. But I love that Trek is taking chances and exploring alternate realities. After all, in 2017/18 these are the scientific realities. I'm excited to see where it goes and trust that, as promised, it will join up with the Prime Timeline. And, in the end, I recall Bill Shatner's words on SNL doing a Star Trek convention spoof so many years ago: ""It's just a TV show. Get a life, will you, people?! Move out of your parents' basements!"" (Said with love and respect to all my fellow Trekkies and Trekkers.)",3 January 2018

"New season i had to downgrade my review.

There are plenty tv shows about relations and stuff.

And only few sci fi series with the budget and skill of startrek please concentrate on the scy fi part.",2 December 2021
"Let's be clear, this is not the Star Trek from your childhood. It changed a lot of the aesthetic, for example the klingons are very different, but considering that TOS is over 50 years old I think it's justified to change the look. At first I couldn't watch past the first 2 episodes, but after coming back with fresh eyes I gotta say that I'm really enjoying it.

Much like Battlestar Galactica this doesn't reboot, rather rebuild.

Also, seeing starfleet science officers talking with glee and exclaiming thier project is "" cool!"" Never gets old.",12 January 2020
"After the trailers of star trek discovery I was not very hopeful about this series.

However it is off to an OK start, acting is a little rigid from some of the side characters but the main characters are fairly good.

Visuals are pretty good striking a balance between JJ-trek and star trek of old, and lots of sounds are familiar from previous series.

As for the plot it is too early to tell, the first 2 episodes seem to have some plot holes but star trek is no stranger to those. For now it is wait and see.

Date of review: 25-9-2017",25 September 2017
"Being a hard core Voyager fan, I liked Discovery. I love the production, love the actors/actresses (Tilly being my favorite). I look forward to new episodes every week. I do feel tho that the emotional states of characters is not really developed. I feel many cannot connect with characters because there is no real attention as to which emotional states led to those emotional states, no real build up. It just kind of happens - an that's why it looks awkward at times. I actually love that emotions are showed, but for it to be effective I guess this is not the way. There should be a lot of what happens behind the scenes, before the emotions are actually displayed.",10 January 2021
I watched last season and I understood why people had issues. The canon was kinda tossed around and everything was dark and bleak. However I believe they tied that up in a good way that explains why the season was that way! Now with season two it's getting its sea legs and I say give it a chance. Every new series has to balance carrying the legacy and reinventing so there are bound to be some bumps but soooo many people from the past treks are supporting this project and the fans should do so as well. We went so long without Star Trek on the air and if we aren't careful it could end up happening again and right now there are amazing plans from Picard to section 31 and an academy series. We should put our doubt on the back burner and embrace this journey and see what it brings. I for one am glad I did and can't wait to see where things are goin,23 February 2019
"I think people have been misinterpreted the pilot. The marketing have unfortunately not been clear about the pilot being a prologue.

And it does its job very well in giving us more insight/depth and dimensions towards the klingons.

The producers of the show have acknowledged the pilot as a prologue after the fact. And given us some clues on what the road a head is.

They explicit mentioned that they are not going to shy away from Star Trek's main focus which is exploration, tech, character development and humour.

They also mentioned that the Klingon war arc would & should not go on for more then one season.

So i'm both curious and intrigued to see how they balance the main purpose of the show with the Klingon War arc - should be fun!

If you want to find out more or just to verify what i'v mentioned do check out their after show: ""After Trek""",25 September 2017
"I've really enjoyed watching the 3 seasons of Discovery. Especially Season 3 made me look forward to every new episode. Don't get me wrong. I also enjoyed Star Trek Voyager. You can place the Discovery series in another category than these older series. I think you shouldn't even compare it to the older series. It's more like the recent movies (with Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto). Lots of great visual effects, a decent storyline and action packed.",9 January 2021
"Anyone know when? Even a month would be better than nothing.....

Thanks! :) Adam",31 May 2020
Just a new and fun show with a bit of bew star trek twist. Nothing too connect too the old shows. Its somewhat new in a sense of shows today because it has a new and good storyline.,24 August 2021
"All the people either slating this with 1 star or deliriously giving it 10 stars, need to either stop being overly narrow minded and / or jumping to conclusions. If there is one thing I have learnt about remakes / covers of films & TV shows over the last 10 years, it is that you must watch with a clean slate (forget what came before) and with TV shows you must work on the rule of watching three episodes to get a fair idea and to give it a fair chance. This show is no exception. It requires you watch the first three episodes for it to be able to tell you a bit about who's who and what's what and then after finishing the 3rd, it chills and settles into the story. Some films do this too with a 'hectic scatty' start. I am now on episode 8, so obviously its not bad enough to have stopped me watching but at the same time its not currently any better than a 'pretty good' show IMHO. I will watch the rest of this season as I think it deserves it and I'm curious to see where it will lead.",5 February 2018
"I saw the wave of horrible biased ""Trekkie/Trekker"" reviews and just laughed. I've seen all the movies throughout the years. Enjoyed all of them to varying levels. The TV shows have always had a lesser than level of execution. The effects/polish was just not there. Not good enough for me to suspend disbelief. This show is absolutely fantastic. All of it. Except the big girl, she's just not funny... Sonequa Martin-Green, unknown to me before this series is giving an absolute masterclass in acting. Just wow.

Too bad so many of you are stuck judging this series based on past timelines and previous material that you can't enjoy it.",7 April 2019
"I have watched all the Star Trek series, movies and I do like this one looking forward to each episode the only thing I did not like was a scene where 2 crew members are brushing their teeth talking about their relationship I do not want this to go to the soap opera route ... too many soap operas on TV lets keep the Star Trek theme exploration, science, let the characters reveal their personalities through their actions in these adventures",30 October 2017
"....Worse and worse. I could roll with the first few seasons and kinda let it stand on its own, but now it has just gone too far. I don't think I like a single character on this show. I don't feel connected to a single one of them. Why? The writers should focus more on who the characters are rather than the ideas they represent. You are leaving the most important part of the character out by doing so.... The individual. Blah. Meh. The show just feels like, I don't know.... A statement and not a story.",13 December 2021
"With everything dark and poor lightning, yes space is dark, but please, the story and characters are way more important than effects. The reason everyone loved the original series is you can see everything. This is like radio show, just close your eyes, use your imagination, you will enjoy better than what you see, which is blackness most of the time. IF that's a spoiler, so be it. I rate it a 6 just because i love Star Trek. I hope it improves.",1 October 2017
"First, the sets and imagery are great! The continuance in this area of previous excellence, is impressive.

That was the pro; the only pro.

Star Trek was always a bit Soap Opera-ish. It is expected. It is (after all) a Space Opera.

The current series (like each Star Trek series before it) must give us a certain amount of validity. That amount must be enough to allow us to suspend our natural disbelief. In short, it must have a certain amount of believable structure.

Discovery fails utterly. The writers have continually presented untenable scenarios: appearing to base their character development on some sort of (misguided) ?Maslowian? Precepts. In short? Unbelievable to anyone who has spent more than a weekend in the real world.

The result? A series which has committed slow, agonizing suicide, wherein each episode becomes more painful that the last.

Starting with a new low in immature plotlines, unbelievable characters, agonizingly drawn-out scenes, and deeply juvenile results, Discovery sags to the floor. Then? The series finishes its decay into sad absurdity by injecting our brains with toxic levels of uber radical-leftist ramblings, mixed with (a very unsubtle) overdose of preachery. Again, Maslow would have been proud. For me? Tedium, followed by sorrow (that a series with such great possibility was utterly wasted, instead).

It is with great relief that I look forward to not watching another episode.",29 December 2021
"Star Trek had numerous versions and stories. But this show is not amongst almost cliched Star Trek theme, show started slow but after a slow building up, second half of season went sky rocketed, almost each and every episode ended up with WTF comment in my lips.

For me, all I can say it quickly became one of the most enjoyable Star Trek series. Also remind me never to read reviews written on first episode again. ""This is not Star Trek, this is PC stuff"" are all wasted space on internet.

Hence, if you want more than ""- Should we do that? - It's illogical to do that. - I'm doing it anyway"" theme, this is right series.",29 January 2018
"I can understand the vitriol Enterprise has received. Playing fast and loose with the continuity was always going to be controversial, as was the darker atmosphere. The thing is, that darkness is there for a reason- it's dealing with some very dark themes- betrayal, loss, death. And there's lots of all of those. But there is also, by the end of the series, that hope for the better tomorrow that is the DNA of Star Trek. Indeed, it is the one strand that holds together the entire story. A lot has been said about this series not being true to the ethos of Roddenberry's vision and, frankly, that's cobblers. This story gives new meaning to that vision, and that hope. Watch it. Enjoy it. Forget about the continuity issues and see just how this makes what will follow (or has gone before) have even bigger meaning. Oh, and the last 30 seconds of the last episode are pure magic that put a tear in my eye.",23 April 2018
"This is the 21st Century. SO of course this New Star Trek WILL NOT reflect the 1960s. This isn't my Daddy's Star Trek. I do thank him for turning on the RCA Color console back in 80s and said: ""Hey buddy, you want to watch Star Trek?"" I've been hooked since. I miss Shat, Nimoy, & Kelly, but I love the newest generation. This is a strong show that is not perfect. But same goes for the older series. Please stop whining about the 'Star Trek of yesteryear'.

"I'm a big Trek fan (hooked as a kid on the original), and have watched all the series and movies (deep space excluded). I was excited about this new show but ultimately found it painful to watch. I really don't like the Burnham character as she grates on my nerves. I stopped watching after the first few shows ...but being a Trekkie, i couldn't help myself and tried again. It was still not great. Many plot lines were clunky and obvious but if you're willing to stick with it I'm pleased to say it gets better. It picks up in ""chapter 2"" and that's why I'm giving it a 6. Hopefully it will continue to improve.",1 February 2018
I tried to get into TNG and other Star Trek spin-offs they all sucked IMHO until Discovery. All the other spin offs tried to be dramatic for the sake of being dramatic. Whoever hates on the captain being black are closet racists.,4 December 2021
"Star trek is about the exploration not only of new experiences and civilisation but the human condition. The other series have this but not descovery (mostly!).

The criticism is that there is too much emphasis on Burnham, and not enough about the crew. Though it is more balanced in series 2, its still not enough.

I am giving this a 6 as despite the shortfalls, it is enjoyable.",15 September 2020
"I've been putting off season 4 for a while as I found season 3 to be woeful. I binged watched it and what I hate about Discovery is the preachy 21st C morals. This is supposed to be the 24th C (forget the 900 years in the future thingy) and yet the crew are effectively emotionally and their attitudes in the 21st. In the real world attitudes change over as little as 60 years but in Star Trek world it depends on the decade the series was made. Even the aliens aren't alien. They are clones of the humans. For a Sci-fi series it doesn't work. For Star Trek series it seems to be the stable fare. Star Trek fans may love this. Sci-fi fans not do much. The special effects or CGI are as good as ever. The acting by some of the main characters can be grating, especially the whisperer. It's wooden and unrealistic. The physics is completely laughable. It makes me wonder if the writers read Scientific American or NewScientist and weave it into their stories without understanding the concepts. Or maybe reality is boring. One thing I will say about the Expanse is that it tries to be scientifically accurate. Not so Star Trek. I like the idea of the anti gravity generators failing but no seatbelts to keep people in their seats. Or the fact you never see the cleanup crews tidying up all the exploded debris that litters the bridge. They fix things fast. Maybe that could be Elons next project.",7 March 2023
"I like this show. Yeah its not quite the same as other star trek shows we have seen but if you compare this show to the last few seasons of DS9 it makes sense. This is a grittier more adult version of DS9.

Go rewatch DS9 again, watch the last few seasons, its nothing like the rest of the shows. Its also the best of all star trek in my opinion.

So yeah, this show is good scifi, and good trek.",3 October 2017
"One thing I don't understand is why this ship is more futurist, if this story was to be taken place before Kurt & Spock! I do like the special affects on this series but I don't like the one side story of Micheal that shows only how righteous the writers make her out to be.",19 January 2018
"I tried watching Season 1. After 4 episodes I stopped caring that I missed an episode here or there. It was sooo bad. Whats up with the Klingons? Why do they look like space rats? And whem they talked it was so boooring! Be quiet Klingons! The ship is so dark inside, I think they couldn't afford lighting on the set. And all of the characters are unlikeable.

"This program is quiet deep to be honest at first I didn't really like it but, I have changed my mind, a lot of serious stuff happens in this program, my second time around watching it and it has grown on me a totally different type of Star Trek, not for kids. Some strange characters but everyone has a personality so why not show everyone's. which they have done very well. Wasn't looking forward to Season 3, but after watching Season 1 and 2 again, can't wait for Season 3 to come out 8 out of 10. Keep up the good work",4 December 2019
"I have to say that my wife hates it with a vengeance.I took her to the Generations exhibition in Edinburgh twice when we were dating and even met Marina Sirtis, but a frightening experience in the toilet with a couple of Klingons was too much for her. I would not want her to meet the latest Klingons from Discovery as they really are scary.I think she will just stick to Eastenders and Coronation Street where reality Is stretched beyond belief.A lot of reviewers have slated this latest series but I really loved it and cannot wait for the next episode.To have a new series is fantastic and I think you have to forget that the technology looks more up to date than TOS as it just does not matter in the grand scheme of things. I thought the acting was great. Mind you I liked Will Rikers acting too.I think people should give it a chance as it may grow on you or would you rather be watching Dot Cotton down at the launderette watching dirty clothes.How many stars can you see.

The show is much better than boring sh** in the 70's. Deal with it your show style will die out with your closed nerd minds.",1 October 2017
"I'm on the 6th episode so far. In general I like the show and plan to continue watching it. However, I'm so accustomed to the proficiency and brilliance of the other Star Trek shows and it's crews that the incompetence of this crew is sometimes mind boggling. I realize that the Discovery was originally meant to be a science vessel. By necessity it's become a war vessel.

But, by episode 6 the Discovery has been losing battles or on the verge of losing battles A LOT. Much more than I've ever seen in any of the other Star Trek shows. Thankfully they have technology that can get them out of danger quickly or they would have been destroyed by episode 6.

Captain Lorca is forever yelling at the bridge crew to work faster, do something, execute commands etc. The bridge crew is constantly saying I don't know Captain, I can't tell Captain, I don't see Captain. Oops I lost it Captain. The First Officer (you know - the preying mantis type guy) cautions ""caution"" on a regular basis. You never see him do much except to caution that he wouldn't do that. Captain Lorca is a real SOB. He slept with the Admiral then put her in position to be captured. The original first officer, Burnham made decisions that almost fried everybody.

This is a lot of criticism aimed at Star Trek Discovery. However, I'm hopeful that the writers will get their heads out of their proverbial tushes and address some of the concerns of many of the critics. They can't do anything about the horrible new ""look"" of the Klingons or the ultramodern design of the Discovery ship that is way more advanced than Captain Kirk's ship which doesn't arrive until 10 years after Discovery. But, maybe they can polish this crew and turn them into a military machine or at least turn the entire crew over to a new Captain and a crew who knows what the hell they're doing.",13 April 2018
I accept slight critics about the fact that star trek discovery is rather a science fiction adventure which involves the star trek universe only on a side note. But it is totally unacceptable that people rating this show with 3-5 or less stars based on this justification. Star trek discovery is a damn good tv show in it's genre. And for me the show is even more thrilling than the classic one's. The second season is even better than the first one! I hope the discovery will flying through our galaxy for a long long time.,17 March 2019
"This is StarTrek, don't let the few butt hurt fanboys sway your mind. I'm an old Star Trek fan and other than a few cringe moments this series is enjoyable.

Most of the main characters are well written and the ongoing storyline while different than other Star Trek episodic series, it still works. If you've been on the fence I suggest giving it a try, you might be pleasantly surprised.",23 January 2022
"Why oh why is every damn episode about Burnham? If she was a likeable character then fair enough but - and let's be honest - she shouldn't even be on board a starship, let alone a ranking officer!

Saru is a likeable character, Tilly is.. well.. Tilly.

And the rest of the bridge crew?

Umm.. unlike, TOS, TNG, Voyager and Enterprise where people could name the majority of the bridge crew after the 1st season, with Discovery, I haven't a clue!

And this is after 3 seasons!! That alone says it all!!

The Art work, CGI/FX are absolutely stunning but the characters are just so hollow.

With the exception of Saru, the rest could all be replaced and I doubt anyone would notice the difference.

This is down to just poor scripts. Get rid of the current writers and get some in who know how to create characters and stories that we want to invest our time in.

And CBS should put someone in charge of the project who at least cares about the franchise.

The only real notable characters were Orca, Georgia, Pike, Spock and Saru.

That really does say it all...

One more season maybe to turn things around?

Let's hope they don't screw up the Georgia series or Pikes return in the Enterprise...

*Update for Season 4*

Okay, I see now why Netflix let this go. 1 star for the FX, 1 for the camera work & sound.

And that's it.

Season 4, well, I struggled to watch the 1st episode. The characters are written so bad & cliqued that I'm giving an extra star just for the actors who had to perform the drivel of a script.

Stark Trek this is not. Weak characters who burst into tears (or look like they're about to) & lets be brutally honest, half of them shouldn't even be in a Starfleet uniform.

You know what, just read the other poor reviews as they've gone more into depth about what is/has destroyed this series.

I've lost all interest and won't be wasting my time watching any more episodes.

Season 4 rating : 3/10.",11 May 2021
I've watched every single thing Star Trek and I have to say I'm loving this new concept. Star Trek as a franchise has to adapt. This is what this show is doing. I love the fact it's got a lot of characters with a lot of input. It was getting tiresome watching everything revolve around 7 core characters whilst nobody else on the bridge or indeed the ship said a word. This feels more real. Ok there are a few timeline issues but let's just re boot our minds and move forward . So far so good for me.,27 March 2019

"I'm a lifelong Star Trek fan but this is not Star Trek, they're just trading on the name. Do yourself a favor and skip this trash. It is unwatchable. Gene Roddenberry would lose his mind if he saw this mess and no doubt not want his name anywhere near it.",21 July 2022
"Look. I'm a TNG gal all the way. Nothing can beat it, not even the original series, in terms of well thought out single mind blowing (and life changing-deep thinking) episodes.

I know there is a lot of hate for this series but let's push that aside for a moment.

This is NOT a series created by Gene, if that's what you're expecting then you are several years too late. If you like the new Star Trek movies then this may be for you. YES, the episodes do not follow the stand alone format, YES each season is an entire story BUT....they are good. Not just good but pretty damn amazing, and that's coming from someone who follows the holy TNG.

The acting is really great. The stories, while somewhat predictable in areas, is also great.

The banter between officers seems on par with humanity as it is now which is fitting since this seems be be among the young Spock timeline. The characters are represented well for a young Star Trek timeline and you genuinely feel emotion (if you aren't Data) for the characters as they go through their challenges.

This is a series to give a chance, and I'm sad that it took me several years before I tried it.....but also happy that I can binge it.

In summery. The characters are great, the special affects are great. The acting is great. The storyline is good, nearly great. It's worth giving a chance if you DO NOT expect that it's a single episode story. This IS Gene Roddenberry.......if he were creating the series now and made it into a movie.",21 November 2021
"Its certainly not easy moving forward a beloved franchise that existed over multiple generations of tv watchers. However, the Discovery crew have succeeded, in my opinion.

As a sci-fi programme it's great. It feels like part of the Star Trek Universe and fills in quite a few gaps.

"I really don't understand all the negative reviews. Since Star Trek began we had several series, several movies. And ll of them are not similar to each other. Do we prefered Deep Space? Nex generations, or the originakl serie? All are diferent. Discovery is diferent. But all of them contains the same....explore the universe, explore the unknown and accept the difference. Do we expect to see the orginal Enterprise , Kirk and Spok in all manifestation? Of course not. Is Enterprise the center of this?Also not. Therefore accept the difference. DIscovery is well made , full of content and interesting caracters. I began 3 days ago and almost finishing the second season and ansious to see how it ends and problably ansious for the 3rd season. Besides being diferent it's great to see the threasures of the past. Loved to see Pike. Ok...didn't like Spock that lot ....to human and with lot of sentiments. For those who is critizing that is to focused on Burnham....wasn't it also the same with Kirk or Picard for example? Even if Burnham being the main ancor...we had a lot of character development , of the crew and othes And for those who criticize the lack of resembelence of the klingons or the talosians...my god....please update the tech to XXI century....imagine you had the same klingons as in 1960's...what would you say? DOn't be fanatic and enjoy it, enjoy the history and the characters...enjoy Pike for examploe",4 July 2019
"As the title suggests Discovery is a really good solid show, The show is getting a lot of hate simply because the people hating on it do not like Trek, do not listen to the hate.

Why do i say this? because any true Trekkie loves all Trek for what it is and not what they think it should be. (Even JJ's FlareTrek)

Haters say Discovery is too full of drama yet sit and watch DS9 which is essentially a soap opera in space.

Haters complain about Discovery not following canon yet they don't realise that Discovery now has control of all Star Trek canon from beginning to end, how can it not follow something it controls?

Haters don't like the fact that Discovery focuses primarily on 1 character even though the story is set around that character... That's like watching The Lord of the Rings and saying you don't like it because it focuses too much on Frodo.

Haters crippled Enterprise on it's first run and eventually got it cancelled due to poor ratings, the only Star Trek show to be prematurely cancelled and yet they took onboard the criticism they were given and gave us something new, Discovery, and now people are hating on this for doing things differently.

It's just that simple.

Discovery is not a masterpiece by any means but it is good solid Trek.

True Trekkies will love the show and will continue to support it whereas all the haters will continue to hate simply because they have to, it is in their nature to just throw hate into the world, Don't listen to them and go watch it to make up your own mind.",28 August 2020
"I felt it necessary to write something, because even one person disagreeing with the tidal wave of negativity is progress of some kind.

I find it ironic that the community once heralded for their progressivism and acceptance of that which is different are so aggressively against this series, without at least seeing the first season through.

I went into this new show a veteran of Star Trek. I grew up with TNG, and avidly watched every episode of Star Trek, straight through to Voyager. Admittedly, Enterprise was not my favorite, but it grew in me. The announcement of a new Start Trek series was both exciting, and terrifying. Exciting to see what they might do, where they might go, and how they might get there. But terrifying to think that another prequel series might not only break canon, but not do well enough to continue if I decide that I liked it.

Well, I sat down on launch day and watched the show while on the edge of my seat. I knew the Klingons were changing, but there was a logic to the reason for the change, and it's not like Roddenberry himself hadn't revamped their look before when the technology and money was available to him. This alone is sufficient justification for developing a fully fleshed out ""alien"" species four the Klingons.

People complain about the technology looking more advanced, which is just a childish nitpick. No one wants to sit down to a futuristic sci-fi made in the modern age and stare at crappy looking props, and even worse special effects. Does it all jive with the TOS-era look from so long ago? Of course not. But this isn't the 1960s anymore, and a starship based in the future, capable of FTL, and powered by an explosive reaction between matter and antimatter shouldn't look like it's controlled by vacuum tubes and buttons from a WWII radio. The original props reflected the way things were done back then, and how little creativity they had for the future of how we would interface with technology. Realistically, people will say the same thing about Discovery in another half-century.

As for the story, every single one of the ignorant people here who couldn't be bothered to watch the entire first season and allow the show's creative team the opportunity to tell their whole story, well you just don't deserve the right to claim you're a true believer in the vision of Roddenberry, because that man was all about looking forward, not back.",27 February 2018
"I've watched every episode of every Star Trek and none have been more visually stunning as Discovery!!! Also none have been more bold in their story line concepts! Not only that but add to the fact of tying this show to the original through the story of Pike the newfound interest in the originals will help carry this universe to a new generation!!! If you want to gripe about something killing the franchise, you'd be better off talking about the last dreadful motion picture that damn near killed the franchise.",19 April 2019
"I can't even say how difficult it is to sit through an entire episode of Discovery Series 3. Series 2 began to show some improvement, but now we are back to some pitiful material poorly stitched together and reference again to the faulty premise that Burnham was responsible for deaths, which in fact she never was at all. The reason Star Trek was interesting was not because of any long-winded serial story with too many complications but because each episode contained a story, enthralling new worlds and science. I don't want to see kissing and romantic and emotional story lines at all. This is not really Star Trek at all. It just exploits the franchise name to produce a series. The Tilly character makes me cringe and I actually cannot watch her scenes. This is lamentable garbage, to be fair to it.",3 December 2020
"Burnham is a fantastic character. The rest of the cast are all unique and great. The acting is perfect. The stories are great and imaginative. The CGI is fantastic and beautiful. The whole series is fresh and beautiful and full of love.

Not every episode is a hit, and not every scene is perfect, but at least as good a hit rate as any of the rest of the franchise except maybe the Voyage Home. If you don't like an episode skip it. I don't care for the first 2 but you probably should suffer through them to get the setup. Maybe that's why so many people hated the series.

Let's rank All the Start Trek franchise:

The original Star Trek The Voyage Home Voyager Next Generation Discovery Wrath of Khan First Contact Lower Decks

Lesser: Star trek Reboot Into darkness Generations

worst: Nemesis, Insurrection Beyond The Motion Picture The Search for Spock The Undiscovered Country The Final Frontier Enterprise Deep space 9 Picard The animated Series

If you agree roughly with my ranking, you will probably like Discovery.",30 April 2021
"When I started to see this season of The Expanse, I realize that Star Trek is way behind on CG & sets when it comes to 4K television. 4K streaming service is going to be the future, not cable. I also do not think Crave has the transmitting capabilities like Prime does for Sci-Fi shows like these. It make it look like models where used on ships & worlds instead of CG on Discovery after watching an episode of The Expanse. Also the inside of the ship is blurred out to show the actors & some other ship consoles, etc. It seems to me this is done to compensate for the streaming provider. I am using the same ISP, devices & TV near the same time late at night. This does not give the excuse of traffic causing the problem. I downgraded my rating because of this & disappointed because I am a huge Star Trek fan for 50 years.",23 December 2020
"I like this show. I did not like the darkness and brutality of first series too much, but second series is much, much better. I always had a problem with original Star Treks as they were absolutely unbelievable. I can believe this future, even if I have to close my eyes to blatant nonsense some time, but that you have to do even in Expanse... Yes, there could be a little less of emotions, but it has a drive and is pretty much unpredictable, which is practically the most important thing on todays shows.",13 January 2020
"I have watched the first 3 seasons. And each season gets worse and worse. This is not Star Trek but someone trying to cash in on the Star Trek Name. The crew of Discovery do not bring an emotional connection with the viewer.

They change the appearance of the klingons for what purpose? Just to be different or try to alienate the fans? In season 2, the only interesting characters were Pike & Number 1. They aren't even regulars to the season. Season 3 who knows what they are trying to do.

I was excited the first season of the show and the even at the beginning of season. However, the payoff for each season was disappoininting. In season 3, they couldn't even get me interested. I know season 4 is starting to air now, but I can give that a pass. It doesn't even interest me.",26 November 2021
"I honestly don't understand the hate. I am 54 years old and have watched every Star Trek series and movie, most of them in first run. I practically lived on TOS growing up. Of all the complaints I have heard there is exactly one that is even remotely valid. Namely the continuity issue concerning the ""spore drive"", and I have a hunch that is going to be dealt with, if not in the first half-season, then come January. My guess is that spore technology will become a ""failed experiment"", and that this is why we don't see it in future series.

Everything else I have heard is utter nonsense. ""Characters are wooden and flat."" Really, go watch Encounter at Farpoint and get back to me. Every series takes time to get its feet under it.

""Sonequa Martin-Green is dry and remote"" ??? You were expecting a human raised by Vulcans to be skipping merrily up the corridors weeping at the beauty of the starshine?

Or, and this is probably my personal favorite, ""its all too shiny and futuristic looking"". Okay, so Star Trek is to be locked into a 1960's aesthetic and limited to cardboard and plywood sets with the cheapest of practical effects so you can be spared the pain of a new looking starship, that's your plan?

Honestly folks, its a good show, and well worth the cost. There is a bit more of an action vibe than in most past series, freely granted. Largely because we find ourselves in the middle of a war(something fully recognized in cannon). Then again the action oriented episodes and movies have always been the fan favorites, so why the problem?",12 November 2017
Now the computer has alot of feelings. The only logical and cold blooded thing now has feelings. The best decisions are made when you are extremely emotional? Logic and clear mind are stupid. How can someone mess so bad an idea like star trek. What is wrong with you?,24 December 2021
"Many people dismissed the show at the start without actually watching it! There were some different aspects when in comparison to other ST shows but it's not meant to be a replica of the original series, or any other. Remember that Discovery is not Enterprise! Now, wait foir it....

As for continuity, it's all explained if you catch everything - like for example; the 3D Hologram (Holographic Visual Comms) and why they appear on Disco and not 'later' on Enterprise. The Klingons (visual and language) took a little time to get used to but this was explained also - after all, humans speak different languages and we have different shades of skin, so too have Klingons. There's even a fun moment regarding the 'new' uniform colours! Now, importantly, why is the Disco nor many of the crewn ot mentioned in other shows (later timeline)?, . - it is all revealled!

I enjoyed getting to know the characters and was glad to see Ct Pike in his early days. (And to keep with original storyline, we see Pike have a flash forward of his ultimate demise). And names from the 'past' but in our future, or is that the other way, anyway, we get to enjoy young Spock, Harry Mud, Sarek, Number One, Amanda, Vina.... and of course Section 31.

Now, there were some great enjoyable moments, combining humour and classic sci-fi paradoxical moments (or not) such as mirror universe, universal translator malfunction, the arrival of Jett and of course fun moments with 'Po', or Me Hani Ika Hali Ka Po, for short! And not to mention young Tilly and her 'moments.' Of course there were some darker scenes and we see the loss of key crew members, so nothing new there. But it's performed well.

And to keep in tune with Star Trek, there's no over-the-top violence or unnecessary swears, so it's fit for everyone.

Let's boldly go, or is that 'to go boldly' (lol) into the future with Discovery and other productions such as 'Section 31.'

And what about the Borg? Let's wait and see.

Helm, hit it!",2 May 2019
"This is not only one of the best Star Trek series it is also some of the best television of 2017! The daring new direction where the captain of the ship has everything to hide and the enemy is beyond redemption or negotiation, is how Star Trek should be done.

Aside from the compeling serialized plot the great diversity of the cast is exactly what the world needs in this increasingly polarized political environment. Just like in the 60's where the Original Series paved the way for increased representation of diverse cultures, this series shows us that we are more alike than different.

Coming off the cliffhanger ending where the first half of the season left us wanting more, the series puts the viewer in an excelent position: ""to boldly go where no one has gone before"". I can't wait for January!",22 December 2017
Star Trek discovery is one of the best series out there today it kind of has a sinister plot to it gives a Game of Thrones vibe but Star Trek instead I would definitely recommend it,5 March 2020
"I was never a Star Trek fan, the shows never appealed to me that much.

Giving 1 Star is an immature rating, not one based on facts, whether or not they might be subjective.

Teeth, holograms - who cares.

They are not bringing in Darth Vader or Han Solo - that would be awkward.

The show is a concept to attract modern audiences and they achieve that by fairly good CGI, sufficient acting and the show feels like a very long movie split into episodes. I honestly really liked it and the concept works in my opinion.

Of course, fan boys will find a lot to hate, but in our world today it became cool to hate things and label them unworthy. It is silly, immature and by all means a waste of time.

The new series will hopefully attract a large audience and keep going for many seasons. I enjoy it very much, maybe because of the lens flares :)

Take it easy, stop hating and think before you write 1 star reviews.",7 October 2017
"The work done on the technical side should not be condemned. However, the writing, pacing and preaching are stunningly appalling. This is not Star Trek. It is a show about a woman who is some sort of god, that's going to save us all, surrounded by right on people who talk nonsense. Star Trek: Voyager had the perfect lead and great characters. Star Trek: Discovery has the worst possible lead character in a show that seems to think cutting from one idiot to the next makes great TV. I'm not surprised Jason Isaacs, a very talented actor, was completely lost in the incompetence of it all. I can only imagine how happy he felt not to be in the second season which was mind bendingly awful. This is nonsensical garbage with great FX.",14 August 2019
"I usually don't write reviews unless I've seen at least one complete season of a show. But with all the negativity among the reviews for this shows urged me to balance things out.

I admit I was slightly skeptical during the two first episodes, but once I had seen the third one things fell in place.

For me Star Trek is, as the title states, discovery. Having seen all of the episodes thus far I'm excepting the discovery to go inwards, namely Michael Burnham's increasing battle with her conscience as opposed by the agenda of Captain Lorca and the mission of the Discovery.

The same applies for Voq considering recent developments in the show.

Hopefully we'll get to see an ever increasing complexity regarding the characters, with lots of gray zones.

I also like how the show combines a sort of gritty feel with sterile surfaces. This gives Star Trek: Discovery a compelling visual flavor which adds to the compelling nature of the show.

Considering the criticism regarding technology I, personally, couldn't care less.

Also I find great humor in that people who don't like the show still take the time to lurk around here, like Cardassian spies, and down vote all the reviews which are appreciative of STD. Love you guys.",15 October 2017
"This will not be a rant or a hateful response to this show like many other reviewers did. I will review this show by core elements I look for in a good sci-if and Star Trek series.

The cast: The show has a large ensemble of characters but don't expect this series to do its best to have you get to know them all. The show is primarily about Michael Burnham. There are some other characters which you get to know somewhat but don't expect it to be deep. Saru, Tilly, Stamets and Culber are the most prominent other cast members but their backstories remain rather shallow. This withholds me from bonding with these characters and even makes some of them unlikeable. Don't compare this series in its character building to DS9 or TNG. Most bridge members are glorified extras and only get to tell a tragic backstory or a useful anecdote from their life when it serves the plot.

Burnham is front and centre in this show. Especially in the first 2 seasons everything seems to be connected to her, which makes her feel like the centre of the universe. I quite enjoyed her character but with season 3 her growth halted and she started to annoy me. She does it all, she knows it all, she solves every problem on her own, she's always right and never has to face any negative consequences for any of her actions. She commits mutiny on several occasions but in the end she's always rewarded for her actions.

In the S3 finale she becomes a superhuman action hero, shooting the enemy through the head with one shot, after completely being pushed in a wall. Star Tek should be about imperfect humans, not superheroes.

She is the most emotional captain you have ever seen in a Star Trek series, often involved in deeply emotional conversations with whispering tones and big, teary eyes. After 4 seasons that is really getting tiresome. It also doesn't help that she is practically an invincible superhero, solving everything on her own with almost no collateral damage. And when the show surprises you with actual consequences, these are being undone almost immediately.

The stories: season 1 was chaotic and messy but it had some nice twists with Voq and Lorca. It was exciting and seemed to move at breackneck speed. I quite enjoyed it and found it to be the best Star Trek I had ever seen.

Season 2 was even better, with a slower pace and the inclusion of Pike and Spock. The episode in which Pike saw his future was the strongest moment I had ever seen in this show until that time. For the second season in a row major characters died, which raised the stakes and tension of the show. The show took risks and I loved it.

Season 3 slowed things down even more and went in a different direction when the touch of Michelle Paradis as the new show runner became clear. The show became more introspective and gave us more and more quiet, emotional talks between characters we still hardly knew by then. These moments felt flat for me because most characters were still so unknown to me that I didn't care enough to have those scenes move me emotionally. For me that made the show boring to watch. The science fiction went to the background to make way for personal discovery. The mystery of the season was quite dragged out and was very anticlimactic for me personally. The stakes turned out to be very low and the ending was too neat and perfect.

Season 4 seemed to slow down even more and gave us even more quiet emotional talks, even in the midst of hectic situations. The mystery of the season yet again was dragged out to long and the finale was very anticlimactic in that it solved everything so neatly and easy that the stakes were non-existent. Every sacrifice, death or damage was undone, and every bad deed was forgiven too easily, removing the emotional impact of all those elements. All in all I found it to be a very boring season. The idea and the moral of the story are true to Star Trek but the execution felt more like Grey's Anatomy in space. This show would really benefit from some more risk taking, actual bad stuff and consequences happening once in a while, together with some characters actually dying.

Is it Star Trek? For me, it isn't. There's hardly any humour, there are almost no remarkable, developing friendships like Bashir and O' Brien for example. We hardly ever see the crew enjoying downtime and experiencing other shenanigans than what the main plot gives us. There is hardly any space exploration, alien planets, or encounters with new alien races. This, together with the spore drive makes the universe feel very small. We hardly get to know the crew, it is more of a one-woman show. The show sure trues to tell true Star Trek stories in season 3 and 4 and the message they try to tell is great, but the execution isn't.

The show is often about telling instead of showing, like the Burnham speeches at the end of S3 and S4, telling about new worlds joining the federation. In S4 it is often told that the DMA is x hours away from Earth but we never get some actual scenes depicting it. Or all the crew telling their backstories instead of showing them. Some more showing can really improve the stakes and the tension that the show so desperately wants to create.

Finally, the SFX are often blurry and the show uses way too much blue and orange colour schemes.

All in all, this show is deeply flawed and I commend it for trying to tell a true Star Trek story but the execution isn't great. It emits a strong sense of diversity but by excluding straight white men altogether, it may feel exclusive to people from that group. We all like to see great role models in our favourite shows, therefore Pike is why I enjoyed S2 the most.

Disco needs much work for S5; hopefully the succes of Strange New Worlds can help with that.

And for the love of god, please find a better catchphrase than 'let's fly'. We're in space, you know, not in the air.",14 December 2021
Please ingore all the negative reviews on here. I am a trekkie fan and Discovery is by far the best STAR TREK EVER!!!!!!!!. And yes I have seen them all. All the movies and all the series.,27 April 2019
"Never saw any star trek series or anything, but i do watch MANY series, and this one looks promising, thinking about watching the old series so i can follow a little bit the story line, but at the moment ""Discovery"" looks all i need to get the idea Good luck Star Trek hope you get a second season",4 October 2017
"I'm maybe younger (25) than people who hate this show. But i sure don't understand the hate. I love it. For me, I was very small watching old ST, this show works like it should, I like the character (strong female characters!), I love how the story is being presented (am at ep7) and wish they would do many many more :). <3",1 December 2017
"Have to admit this series isn't bad at all...and is about as soul- searching as TOS was designed to be. The singular story arc allows for focus on the characters and their development within that universe and along that time-line. It subtly questions Starfleet and its Prime Directive in a way last seen in the second JJ Abrams reboot, which is something TNG, DS9, Voyager or Enterprise failed to address. Discovery is far more cinematic in look, feel and progress than standard TV but it is Netflix and I'm loving the way it's unraveling in its slow burn narrative.",5 November 2017
A girl named Michael is supposed to be Vulcan trained but goes running off in all directions chasing every emotional surge she experiences and contradicting herself left and right. And who thought hairless Klingons was a good idea? Absolute worst story. They have tons of money to spend on sets and actors but no idea what direction to take a new series. Horrifyingly bad.,11 July 2019
"I understand how some people may not like it. It's definitely a change. I have always enjoyed star trek. Amazing concept. And yet it always felt as though i was in the most expensive restaurant in town, eating the juiciest steak, served with... the wrong spices. Bland flavour even though that meaty centre melts in your mouth. Star Trek Discovery fixes it for me. It has action, it's darker and grittier. It shakes off that 1950s perfect middle america ""niceness"" and delivers that yearned for flavour. It is everything i have always wanted star trek to be. Action sci-fi at its best.",27 March 2019
"Watched the 1st season over a week and it's hands down the worst Trek by far. It was getting to the point I was expecting crew members to have their own safe space where they could go for a cry when they got overwhelmed with emotion. And real men appear to have been phased out of existence, replaced quivering wrecks or as was the case the one strong male character was from another universe and no surprise he was 'evil'. And what's with these little 8 or 9 stone butch women battling Klingon warriors, Lorca and winning? This Burnham character is ridiculous. Totally unbelievable in the role she's in. All she's got are stern faced looks and boring monologues. Get real, this is a an absolute joke. Even the Klingons have a woman running things at the end of the series. Lol No chance I'm watching any more of this rubbish.",11 December 2021
Too much hate this show has received... I find it most enjoyable! The cast is very good the visuals are outstanding the plot continues nice from episodes to episode and in a very interesting way. There is a persistence with Burnham in the show it seems she is the main protagonist but in my opinion the show has focused too much on her. The whole gay thing is the only bad in this show. Well almost every show now is trying to project as much gay idea as it can and that is a disgrace. Everyone can do whatever he want we don't care seeing it at shows and movies. Jesus. Nevertheless if someone just close his eyes and ears to all the hate from others and not to expect to be the same as the old S.T original and S.T TNG I'm certain he will enjoy the show.,16 September 2020
"I think this is a really good show, of course it can get a lil sappy at times but all in all fantastic visual effects, new species, and new storylines. Keep pumping the seasons out and I'll definitely keep watching!",17 March 2022
"I guess if you are a Treky a devoted fan then I can understand why some have given this show poor reviews. The background is the Star Trek Universe however the story line is different and is much more centered around specific characters. For me I prefer this as it allows for twists and turns that you don't get in the usual Star Trek storylines. What I enjoyed was the character development and the new technologies that I hadn't come across in the Star Trek world before. If you give it a chance things unfold and there are a few satisfying moments when questions are answered that you didn't even think there was a question for. I am not a Star Trek fan myself just a lover of a good story. If it works for me it works. This one did. I found it entertaining and it kept me interested and wanting more. I hope they keep going. It may trip up on the basis that it has Star Trek in the title which sets expectations and might put non fans off watching. While Star Trek fans turn away because it is character driven rather than driven from Star Trek origins, ethos and the more overarching storyline of ""Going where no man has gone before. Searching out new planets and civilizations!"". If you can step back from that just see it as a sci-fi TV show it's a great ride and well worth watching. It's got a flavour of the recent movies as well which I am sure has divided some fans too. Personally I enjoy them apart from the third one which I thought was a bit weak. Anyhow give it a go. You get the payback in the last few episodes I promise! ;)",27 April 2018
"Geez - Sorry to say, this version is SO bad. Into 2cnd Episode of Season4. Still bad as they flop from Plot to plot looking for a show. My GOD it's Bad !

And the various PC/Woke characters ... do they all have to be so absolutely Nauseatingly squeaky clean & nice ? Oy -this show is TERRIBLE.

SO here we are -Season 4 Episode 5, and who shows up ? From Countless drams & series - the actor Shawn Doyle. Now he he is an okay Character actor. One of those Cadre of actors that comprise a small group of these standby men & women who, in the last 10 years or so seem to show up in every Cable drama that exists. The problem is - ENOUGH already ! Tois guy does not belong in Star Trek or Battle Star or ANY of the lame Sci Fi retreads. He is miscast & only reinforces the Generic quality of these RETREADS !

Just because something went well or OK for 50 odd years (depending on your views on certain series-Voyager/DS9) doesn't mean this isn't just as good, or can't be. Take off your Trek Goggles for a moment and forget all you knew before. This show is deeper, and requires more of your attention, providing you with that feeling of ""What Happens Next?!?"" that many Trek series didn't. No more episode to episode simplistic plots-- this is stronger. Love the old Star Treks for what they were and are, and try to accept and love this one for what it is trying to be.

"Anyone that thinks Discovery isn't Trek should go re-watch season 1 on TNG. Times change, things change. It seems like the biggest gripe is that it doesn't follow the traditional forumla! That's a good thing! I for one want creativity, not rehashed storylines (for example, there is an episode is in every series from TNG to Voyager where the crew ends up somewhere in the 20th Century). If you want boring formulaic stuff that's been done before and that doesn't take any risks then Discovery is not for you.",1 March 2019
"You may not like what you are seeing, but the option is to watch re- runs and I don't know about you, but that is boring after a while.

Some tips for the disappointed ""you"".

Clear your mind, forget about how Klingons looked in TNG and onward, the Klingons in this show is more akin to the Klingons that Capt. Kirk met which by the way is as it should be, as this is 10 years prior his ""time""

Now do the same if you are into the technological gizmos, bear in mind the original series was made in the 60's and they conjured a ""possible"" future in form of technology , now 50 years later, the makers of Discovery, does the same.

Discovery is as much for the cravings of a series-hungry trekkie as it is for the wider audience, but on some points they will cross the line, it is inevitable.

As for me, I will and have adapted, to be honest, once I cleared my mind, I actually enjoyed it, this is way way better than nothing.",27 September 2017
I have seen all the star trek series so far and i don't get the hate this one gets. It has all the elements from other series. It has a more movie like feel and a bit more grim than previous series. But i am loving it. I am OK with smaller tweaks that makes it more up to date. Hope it will start a new chain of series like the tng/ds9/Voyager times. Thumps up,6 November 2017
"I've never written a review, but this time around, season 4 was so bad, it just pushed me over the edge to make sure you don't waste your time. Season 1-3 had it's gaps and was okay, about a 5/10, but season 4 oh my! It has gotten from bad to worse. It has drifted so far from the original Star Trek. It seems there is a political correctness undertone that superseded any script writing and characters. The feel of the series is depressing, over dramatic with endless dialogues that lacks any substance. The visual effects is watered down that it's almost laughable. I'm Star Trek fan through and through, still playing the Star Trek Fleet command game, watching the older films now and then. But this is a pile of rubbish. If you like sci fi, don't waste your time.",11 February 2022

"Absolutely amazing show! The new movies have really set the ball rolling for a reboot that works. Discovery has taken it to a new level.

Special effects are top notch, and the redesign of the Klingons really works well, although that one did take some time to grow on me.

I like the continuity of the Season. They've taken a page from Enterprise's book, but they've actually made it work. I hope they keep this going in some form.

Overall, a nice re-imagining of the franchise with some great throwbacks to the Original, Harry Mudd being my favorite. Can't wait for Season 2!",27 June 2018
"I am Trekkie, always was and always will be. Voyager and DS9 were the shows closest to my heart. Needless to say I was excited that a new Startrek series was coming, Excited and also skeptical.... Because how can one make Startrek even better? Right! That is very hard!

What I find the absolute most disappointing about this series is all the people hating just to hate! First they whine that we don;t get a new series, then we DO get one and they do nothing but hate.... Then wonder WHY we never get new good shows... because of people like you, that is why!

We live in a new era, we moved on, these are new times, if you want the Startrek from the 60ties, go watch that! But don;t go expecting Startrek to stay stuck in those, they are trying to get a new generation for Trekkies, which is perfect! More Trekkies is always better!

The show itself looks great, sounds great and the acting is on par. So stop all the whining and the hating and just try to enjoy the show for what it is, and do not try to protect the purity of Startrek. Loosen up, and most importantly, lighten up! If you don;t like it, don;t watch it, just don;t try and ruin it for all the people that ARE happy we have a new Startrek!",26 September 2017
"There are viewers/fans who seeks to find themselves in a character in every Star Trek series and heal a little loneliness. I understand that but it's not my thing and that might be why I really enjoy and appreciate this series. You might not find yourself in this series and I'd say it's because the characters change so quickly due to big impact events. Those events right from the beginning are slowly adding up to something big that involve a lot of new tech and thus a lot of flexibility for the writers.

Season three takes Star Trek somewhere it has never been - there is a new stage for a new but also old audience. Setting the stage needed the Federation to lose...a lot. It simply means there is a lot to re-gain and that is where the true Starfleet adventure is found. It is also where we see characters history become important. Season three almost re-creates the constant first-contact (or second-contact you might say) scenario with a unique situation each time.

If I'm right we could start to see regular episodes that resembles the best elements of all Star Trek series - especially diplomacy. While at the same time staying modern for a less stereotype-demanding viewer which is a 20th century mind-set. That is what I felt by episode three of season three.",14 December 2020
"Starfleet officers are apparently now immature, unprofessional, disrespectful, childish, self-indulgent, and emotionally incontinent. They are also foul-mouthed. Basically spoiled toddlers raised by trashy parents. All those good writers who used to write thought provoking and inspiring stories were presumably busy with other things as well. Why does this even bear the Star Trek name? Sonequa Martin Green Saves the Universe Many Times would be a more apt title. It's a shame Anthony Rapp, Sonequa Martin Green, and Michelle Yeoh got suckered into this convoluted, vapid mess. Sorry folks, this is not good enough. It's an embarrassment to the franchise. It makes The Final Frontier look like Shakespeare.",10 February 2023
It's rare to find a tv series which has me itching for the next episode and Discovery does just that. It's even rarer to have such original and brilliant concepts as run through this show and sci-fi must be the hardest genre to keep free of the tedious cliches which infect most popular entertainment. The writing is brave and heartfelt the characters rounded and engaging the direction is gripping. I love this show - it's the only thing worth watching and in a league of its own.,28 March 2019
"The first 2 series were good, the third felt weak but I watched it in the hope it would improve, it didn't. Finally finished season 4 and it's awful. They should end it now and put time and effort into Lower Decks and. Strange New Worlds.

The 5th series is meant to be the last, if it is hopefully they get rid of the series arc and copy what Star Trek has done before and make it episodic based, it would be tighter and a whole lot better than the mess the last two season have become. They probably won't as the writers and producers are tone deaf and carrying on with what they want and not what fans want.",4 November 2023
"Brilliant - Bringing Star Trek into the 21st Century, I have enjoyed every Star Trek Series and movies for their own uniqueness, but Discovery is brilliant in its fast paced, modern reproduction of old classic stories - just let yourself go and stop winging... otherwise go and make your own Star Trek?

Can't wait for series 3 and hopefully many many more to come.

You will all be complaining if Hollywood abandons the franchise... how would that feel.",11 April 2020
"I really don't understand the hate for Season 3. It tries something bold and new with plenty of rich story telling but because it's 'not like the old one' it gets hates. Move on people, Star Trek has :-)",11 January 2021
".... And calling out the snowflake fanbois who are missing the point entirely. If we were to remove the Star Trek label from the title of this amazing series, I'm almost 100% convinced this show would be getting 7-10 star reviews. As it is, too many mummy's-boy Trekkies are getting all vitriolic over a show that doesn't strictly adhere to the rigid format and themes of TNG. Guys... This is the 2020s, not the 1980s... Unless of course, I've been watching a totally different series and have gotten this mistaken. Nope. This is by far one of the most emotive, exciting, interesting and entertaining science fiction shows in the last 10 years (with maybe the Expanse being a touch ahead of it). It's genuinely bewildering that people should be hating on it so much. Yes, it's not perfect, yes there are one or two episodes which could have been left out but in my opinion this is up there with shows like Twin Peaks and The Mandalorian in terms of bingeworthy entertainment. Seriously fanbois, just wind yer necks in.",10 January 2021
"It's been getting ever so vaguely more trekky in seasons 3 and 4, but it's still the worst thing that's ever happened under the title ""Star Trek"", so I refuse to update my rating. (Picard S1 wasn't much better, CBS, don't get your hopes up.) Burnham still sounds as arrogant as in season 1 every time she opens her mouth, I think this show might have compromised the actress herself for me - I may just automatically hate everything she's in from now on.",11 January 2022
"It's ironic to me that so many of these review bombers are complaining about ""woke SjW garbage"" when the original Star Trek cast a Russian and had the first interracial romance on American TV during the Cold War. Seems to me that ST Discovery is totally in keeping with Star Trek and ST TNG. The show is exciting, fun, engaging and ultimately optimistic. The people who are hating on it are just whiny snowflakes who are uncomfortable with a cast that's representative and story arcs that deal with current trends and issues...which the original Star Trek was also criticized for as well.",18 November 2020
"The show has great CGI and production value. The plot is also mostly interesting and at least most of the time somewhat logical. So the whole thing makes a decent SciFi series.

However it fails completely as a StarTrek Series in way of storytelling, stylistically, prop design and fails to fit even slightly inside the Star Trek canon.

The worst part about the show are the characters: Unlikable, unreasonable, none or random character development, which suddenly hops back and forwards. Apart from the actor each character is extremely inconsistent in behavior.

So to summarize most of the characters seem to have the emotional stability of Teenagers in their worst years. So the emotional irrational and arbitrarily behavior of the crew has more to do with aforementioned teenagers on a school trip than the crew of a military vessel. So I guess the endless emotional meaningless stupid and repetitive discussions about values and qualifications the characters keep on having are kind of consistent with the rest, but unfortunately not enjoyable.

All of this might even work if the show wouldn't take itself to seriously but it does quite the opposite.

So it is kind of hard to give a rating. If you are looking for CGI and action filled SciFi and you can/want to turn off your head it actually is a decent show maybe 6 or 7. But if you are looking for StarTrek or other forms of serious world building SciFi it's bad.",23 November 2021
"The show has brilliant production values and at times feels like a movie. The acting/scripting once you get past the first episode intro is top notch.

Now....the Klingon's......yes they do look different but they do now look like menacing alien creatures and not so much a bloke with a fancy dress mask stuck to their face. Some are unable to get past this which is odd considering how they looked in the original series in comparison to later incarnations. Holographic communication is new but it does make sense to bring in something like this but once again some quote cannon etc etc... If the above bothers you then....um OK...but to give this amazing start to a show a 1 out of 10 is frankly very silly on so many levels that you just have to laugh the stupidity off.

Watch it, support it and hopefully at a later point we will get more star trek which may possibly carry on from ds9. Friends who have watched the first two episodes have really enjoyed it so please watch and make your own mind up.",26 September 2017
"I don't get all of the negative reviews. Took a couple of episodes to get to know the characters, but its still an engaging addition to the Star Trek universe. Give it a try.",16 October 2020
"Beautifully done, excellent acting, I can't get enough of this show.By far some of the best Trek of them all",19 January 2019
"First time I write a review and I felt the need to do so here, seeing all the excessively biased reviews. I'm sorry, but 1 star out of 10 is complete negative bias. No way is the show this bad. I can understand disappointment coming from the die-hard fans, but at least be fair. I'm a Star Trek fan myself and appreciate all sorts of SciF, yes that also includes Star Wars, Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, etc.etc..

To put things into perspective, this is a sort of reboot and modernization of Star Trek. Yes, so far they've put aside the ""exploration"" aspect. Yes, there are more battles and violence than in previous Star Treks. Yes, the ""techie"" side kind of got put away. But no, the show is not ""bland"". No, the show does indeed remain interesting in its own way. No, violence and action doesn't make it undeserving.

This is a fun show. Put aside the ""Star Trek"" title if you have to, and enjoy it for what it is : a science fiction / space TV show. If that doesn't float your boat, go back to the original series and keep on mulling about the past. Or better yet, jump onto these ridiculous TV reality shows and quit Sci Fi altogether. For those who gave this show 1 star, shame on you as you aren't true SciFi fans. I do feel some shows are much better than others, but this one (so far for entertainment value) gets a 7, 7.5 star in my books, which is better than average.",28 October 2017
"Watched and loved expanse then start season 4 of this and my lord. Please just cancel it and delete it. Wokeness and feelings. Lorca was the only intresting character, after that it went down hill and by season 4 it's a steaming pile of plop.",14 March 2022
Stop trying to hold onto the past and enjoy what is now ffs. Sorry but I really enjoy it!!,26 January 2019
I am huge fan of star trek the first two season of Discovery was fine but season 4 very difficult to watch. It's only about bulschit emotive conversation every 5 min. No action no real conversation. I am very disappointed by this the full principe of star trek is getting lost in here.,21 December 2021
Too emotionality but good enough stories and it can create new perspectives despite crying scenes. Update: But 3rd season is terrible,22 February 2021
"Just finished watching last episode of season2. To my conclusion, the show is not about the Starship Discovery, it's more focus on one main character, Michael Burnham, everything else evolved around her. Unlike other Star Treks which will have small stories for other characters as well. The show also dwelling on long goodbyes repeatedly and sometime one right after another. So this is more like a really really a long movie with one episode that breaks in to small little parts.",30 April 2019
"All of these 1 star spams does not reflect the show fairly. I have seen quite a few Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes, but I do not consider myself a Star Trek fan (or rather ""trekkie""), however I am a mad fan of Science Fiction.

Note that this review is of the two first episodes:

Positive:

The show had great visuals and the action was great. It was possible for me to follow the story without having to have watched every other show.

Negative:

The dialogue was kind of weird? Some lines didn't seem natural and was only said to spout story. My biggest complaint was forcing all of these feminist and other ideals into the show.",29 September 2017
"This is literally WISH brand Star Trek. Everything looks remotely familiar but it's as if everything you know and love about Star Trek has been put through every language in google translate and then translated back to English. Absolutely nothing is good about it and the lead female character has no believable grit and is constantly drowning on with the big speeches that are meant to inspire but actually wind up being very annoying, like the kid who won't shut up. Probably the worst piece of Sci-fi I have ever watched. No redeeming qualities.",4 December 2021
Worth the watch. really loved it both season 1& 2. star trek still rocks. dont listem to others. definitely worth a watch,19 April 2019

"I see all the 1/10 reviews and I'm thinking to myself, you must be a manipulative group of people with an unexplainable incentive to trash a rather good series. Well, I never had an urge to review anything here, but this time I had to. Star Trek Discovery is awesome, it has an intelligent storyline, I'm hooked, and I want more of it! Please go elsewhere if you don't like it, don't trash the ratings.",13 April 2019
"Ignore the trolls rating this 1 and 2. Story, music, action, cinematography are all excellent, especially after season 1. Episodes are wonderfully colored and vibrant, the technology animations are amazing. Love every episode.",7 July 2021
"This is not like the old Star Trek shows that I've grew up with, where genres are simple & clear. With this show, you'll find trans characters, gays, lesbians, etc, even the captain who uses a male's name Michael to make her look more in command & more authoritative. Basically it is a Star Trek show created for LGBTQ people in mind. The show also has more soap operas, less action & adventure.",20 March 2022
"I am a massive Star Trek fan and have seen all the programs, been to conventions etc. etc. blah blah blah.

The problem everyone seems to have with this show is that it's not like the previous ones. This is ridiculous.

It's almost like the DS9 Gamma Quadrant war arc to compare it to an ""old"" show (although I watched TNG onwards weekly when they aired). Otherwise a good comparison would be that this is the Dark Knight to the original Batman TV series.

It's modern, dark, edgy, very well written and has phenomenal acting. It takes Star Trek somewhere different which is interesting!",23 January 2018
"While this show was a mediocre attempt to bring Star Trek to a whole new generation of fans, it seems that it falls flat, especially with the most recent episodes. Casting Stacy Abrams as the president of a United Earth was especially awful. A ""woke"" person that failed to win her own state, much less a nation or planet was a plot line too far. The acting throughout this show is sub-par, but not terrible (like Lily from Modern Family...she is undoubtedly the absolute worst actor/actress that I have ever seen.) Do yourself a favor and watch reruns of the original, or The Next Generation. This one will only depress you.",23 March 2022
"I for one found the series more diverse than any other startrek series I've watched. There may be talk of the cheesy story lines, and diversity in many forms going on here, but none the less I found it a riveting series to watch. After all, what series/show doesn't have any of this? Indeed, there may be an undue focus on the Michael Burnham character, but it has made no difference.",16 January 2021
I normally do not write reviews but I saw all the 1 out 10 reviews for this show and had to say something. There are way to many people hating on this show because they can not and do not like change. Is this show exactly like the older Star Trek shows no it is not. That's what makes this show good. Star Trek can not stay the same through every show that it has. It has to grow and adapt. This is a good Sci Fi show based in the Star Trek universe. It is not perfect but by no means is it 1 out of 10. I really enjoy Discovery and Picard and I am looking forward to Strange New Worlds. I am also not a Trekkie that hates everything that Kurtzman has created just because its not what Star Trek used to be.,7 October 2020
"The Good: Quality Acting; Dynamic cinematography; Visually stunning CGI (Vulcan Ship Design); Characters interpersonal relationships are more realistic and gritty

The Bad: Minor Plot Holes; Unbelievable and confusing science at times

The Ugly: The Klingons, Saru and Star fleet uniforms are going to take some getting use to

"Not sure why some of you hate it so much, I grew up on ST and this is an excellent new beginning. Well written, new ideas, new characters.... What's not to like?

Please do not listen to the naysayers, keep making this and many of us will keep watching!!",28 January 2019
"Lifelong fan here. I've found something to love in every star trek incarnation, from TOS to Enterprise. I made it through season 1 of the aptly abbreviated STD mostly on the excitement of a new show. The unnecessary revamp of everything Klingon, the multitude of aesthet inconsistencies, and the writing were all contributors to making the show so hard to watch. What little quality was present in the writing and acting was gone by season 2, to the point where I started and stopped watching it several times and took over a year to finish it. The only explanation for season 3 is thag they made a coordinated effort to make it horrible. It watches like a b-rate sci-fi was given good effects. I couldn't finish the second episode and never went back.

In summary, if you enjoy the hopefulness, moral philosophy and consistency that made previous ST shows the icons they are, then this cheap copy is not for you. It's a sad, shallow, pedantic show and an unworthy successor to the franchise.",21 December 2021
"I've been a trek fan since I was a toddler and right the way through till now. Discovery is trek for the modern era, it keeps the ideals and hope of the franchise and includes everyone in that story now. The characters are brilliant and flawed, the writing is top notch and the stories are unique. If people don't like this new addition to the series they don't have to watch it. I will keep watching and hopefully it will carry on. Keep putting the best you can into what you do and the work will find friends. It has found one here. Live long and prosper Discovery!",5 February 2019
"I wish I could separately rate seasons, I have enjoyed 1 and 2, 3 was watchable, but the 4th season is abysmal. Unending boring character soul-searching mono/dialogues completely ruined the experience. I've stopped watching after the 5th episode.",27 December 2021
"To all those who are moaning about this show. Here is an idea for you.. Get out more. Get up ask mummy if your allowed out and get out. No this is not star trek. Because star trek is dead along with most of the cast. That's why this is not star trek. Its called mindless escapism. That's all. Don't watch it, turn it off. This is a good show not brilliant but good.",5 October 2019
Plenty action .but weird at times. Hope for third season,25 April 2019
"I don't care what anyone else says, I've seen everything Star trek has to offer, and this reminds me of Next Generation.

People who speak of flops will do well to remind themselves of Star Trek: Enterprise, watchable exclusively for hardcore Trekkies.

Star Trek has had to evolve and with Discovery, has done it brilliantly. Great cast, some excellent acting and a brilliant, evolving story-line.

Forget being a Trekkie, this show will have anyone by the edge of their seat.

Anyone who doesn't enjoy this ... has no sense of adventure.",15 November 2017
"I mean where to start with this show. Star Trek has a history of the first 2 seasons being rocky. This is just bad in so many ways. The writing, the acting, directing, even the cinematography is bad. Set design is way too dark and the costumes and makeup are even odd and look uncomfortable. I guess the cgi is ok. It seems like someone at corporate gave them a checklist of things that they think the audience would like. Then the writers just put those down on paper and all congratulate themselves on being clever. I can't think of a comparison because usually when something is this bad it doesn't make it past one season. I guess the last season of Game of Thrones is most comparable show. It's just so bad on so many levels I honestly have no clue how they keep getting funded for more seasons.",18 November 2021
"Christopher Pike was exactly what the show needed. To be honest, Michel gets on my nerves and i wished thy continue with Pike and Spock and the Enterprise instead of Michael and the Discovery",22 April 2019
"Why should the set design look like the star trek of previous iterations? We must keep in mind that set design has come a long way since the 60's , 70's and 80's back then the most advanced computers they had ran on punch cards, and CGI was but a dream in the far distant feature heck, they completely missed the mark on tablets. Even in TNG they were using multiple tablets when all you needed is one if you have unlimited online storage! Give the set designers a break we have moved on from the ""big back"" TV well most of us anyway their are a few hold out's the the geriatric crowd that think computers and the internet are just a fad. So far I think it's great, it's gritty. Definitely not my parents Star Trek.",2 October 2017
"Sci fi loving people dont believe tha bad rating of the show. Its because of the so called trekkies. Trekkies should be ashamed giving Discovery bad reviews. They forget its 2018. All i hear is thats not canon, that are not Klingons. The show Is quality. The actors are very good. The story is excellent. Give it a chance",14 April 2018
"When reading all the negative commets I was prepared for the worst. I am a fan for about 20 years at least. Having seen all series. Except for DS9 I loved them all. Voyager and TNG as favourite.

Now Discovery. The first 4 episodes were tough. Yes really tough. I had voyager in my mind and this is NOT Voyager or TNG. New caracters, new storyline, new gadgets. But that changed from episode 5. I started to see the different layers in the story and it is amazing powerfull.

TNG and Voyager are kinda childish compared to Discovery... I almost feel ashamed by writing this because I still like to look at some of the episodes but it is nothing compared to Discovery!!!!!! wow

The story has several layers, when used to the caracters they are real people with whom you can connect, the dialogues are from out of this world. So powerfull and apealing with real depth. The visuals are mind blowing etc. etc.

Yes Star Trek has moved on. I understand that many want to see Voyager or TNG but come on guys move on with Dicovery. Yes it will take some episodes to get used but you will massively be rewarded.

Thank you Netflix for bringing me Start TRek Discovery!!!",13 February 2019
"I have watched ALL the Star Trek series, spin-offs and this series is at the top of the heap! I have seen people whining about its long, not like star trek,etc. YOU obviously have not seen all of the star trek series. These series has very well written interesting plots on each episode that pull you in to the next episode. I had start watching this when it first came out but some reason stopped and so I started watching it again and I am wondering why I stopped watching it.",6 February 2022
"Season 1 was irritating. It was very much Current Year rather than the future. But it did have some redeeming features.

So I stuck with it, even watched it again and came to the conclusion that it's very good sci-fi, even if it has little in common with any other Star Trek and is too far up it's own behind.

Seasons 2 & 3 passed. Don't really remember them off the top of my head. Still the same woke nonsense in there.

I'm having real trouble with season 4. It's so slow. And so emotional, kind of. It's like Oprah in Space. Self indulgent and whiny. Lots of long emotional conversations about stuff that Starfleet Officers should be able to deal with. Don't they go through training? Ugh. And all the women. Every leader has to be a female these days, apparently. And they'll still find something to moan about. How about some balance?

If these people wanted to do a sci-fi show set on a spaceship in the future why not just do that? This isn't Star Trek.

And one more thing - they created a body for a person that was somehow floating around and seen by only one other person. Then they somehow managed to get that disembodied phantom to actually enter the new body. BUT. If they can just make new bodies and transfer consciousness into it, they have literally just ended the medical profession. And found a way to make everyone immortal. A very stupid storyline indeed.",12 December 2021
"The show is a standard sci-fi fare with fantastic settings, deep lore and interesting characters with back stories. Some ideas are recycled from former shows but are nonetheless interesting and engaging in their own ways.

One piece of advice though, make sure not to judge it in anyway with other Star Trek series. The best would be that you haven't seen those at all. It would have garnered 8+ rating, if it had been an original instead.",21 November 2017
This almost seems like it should be post NGT but definitely enjoying this series. I hope it will continue more than the other series.,24 May 2020
"After months (years?) of anticipation, Star Trek Discovery finally aired on Netflix tonight, and it has been worth the wait. As an adolescent during the TNG era, I remember staying up late in a dark house, or hanging round at a friends place, watching the latest episode on a little square TV. Star Trek was exciting, a glimpse into a possible future and an allegory of current events.

To me, the the pilot episodes of DSC gave me recaptured the feeling of those dark nights, where belief could be suspended with enough reality to keep you grounded.

Without a doubt the pilot episodes leave the viewer wanting more, with a brilliant set up and really no clue as to how the series will evolve. Unpacking DSC is going to be a heck of a ride.

Technically, the video and effects are stunning. There is significant evidence that a great deal of attention has gone into the detail, and the use of cutting edge visuals really adds a new dimension. The audio is absolutely on point, with plenty of consistency with audio in other Trek. The artistic license taken to deign the characters and re-design some species has paid off handsomely.

Living outside the US, in the past it has not been uncommon to receive shows months or years after they air in other places. Netflix and CBS should be congratulated for their approach which some would see as a risk, but others know is the future of video content delivery.

All in all, a real pleasure and a show I will be looking forward to greatly every week.",25 September 2017
"I've followed this show, sometimes against my better judgement since season 1. After the third season, I expect a star trek show to have found its footing and start producing more favorable plotlines and episodes that have a little something for everyone. As a kid, I grew up on 90's treks and while I realize Berman and team are gone, no longer producing those episodic plots anymore, this is a terrible turn for the branding. The seasons were steady and somewhat palatable until season 3 jumped the whole dang shark. Now every season since has revolved around feelings and emotional break downs. We've gone 2 seasons now without one space battle. NOT ONE! They don't even do much with the sci-fi science-y aspect either. I feel like it's a daytime soap opera with woke overtones and sci-fi themes.

This last season was the end for me. Won't be watching any further. Thankfully we have more trek coming are way so I can thoroughly wave bye to this garbage show and its garbage cast.

PS: Don't bring real-time politicians on your show to portray... politicians. We already know you picked a side on this show, but it's just rubbing the viewer's face in it at this point and it's a huge turn off.",18 March 2022
"Let's be clear, here - every Trek series has taken its own angle on the Star Trek universe. When DS9 first came out, the uproar from ""purists"" and ""pundits"" about a stationary space ""ship"" was hilarious to follow.

However, the true mission of Star Trek is, and always has been, to present an optimistic view of the future where ""people"" of all creeds and races (and species) worked together for the betterment of ""humanity."" The platform for this mission was a show tgat involved a crew jetting off on exciting adventures - yet always making the viewer ponder a bit about the philosophy of life.

Think what you will about the acting, technology/CGI, writing, etc - Star Trek Discovery delivers on this mission in spades.

I personally love it, have grown to love the characters and their relationship. Michelle Yeoh makes my heart sing every time she is on screen. Sonequa Martin Green was perfectly cast in the lead role. And gorgeous Ethan Peck is a great addition to Season 2.

Don't listen to the haters - revel in this series!",7 April 2019

That said, this iteration has got an extremely strong 'camp' influence which I don't agree with. Star Trek has always played middle ground and I think it's trying to over compensate with the changes in our current time.",19 March 2019
"I have to laugh at so many single star reviews by 'outraged' Trekkies This series is the series Star Trek needed. It has intriguing characters, fantastic actors and storylines that maintain the star trek culture but drag it into the mainstream. Michael Burnham is a person you can easily like and emphasize with. She is flawed, determined to a fault, and very human. The stories swings and flows between traditional Star Trek themes and more mainstream sci-fi storylines. There are even elements of 'geiger-escque' horror thrown in on occasion as well as a smattering comic relief. I who have watched all Star Trek series, enjoy it, as does my wife who was never a Star Trek fan. This series is definitely worth your time",23 February 2019
"Season one- kind of OK.

Season two- saved by Captain Pike.

Season three- everyone's crying.

Season four- completely unwatchable.

In the future, white men are extinct- straight white men should i say.

Star Trek for the #metoo generation.

Embarrassing.

Hopefully, Strange New Worlds will be different, and hopefully, we'll be able to hear some semblance of Gene Roddenbury's original vision, instead of this over-politicised garbage.

"I never watched the originals and I know people cling to them, and I'm sure its rightly so.

I enjoy this version, and how it grows and has its complexities. There is a little stumbling with plot and acting but overall I enjoyed the hell out of this show. It is a very J. J. Abrams take on the tv series, but I think it captures the fun and exciting parts of the show. I like the change of pace with the different captains and strong leads, followed by equally strong supporting actors. Unique story lines including the black alerts and its origin as well as supporting characters backgrounds being flushed out really made the show great.

The tie in with the origins of the original series was interesting but not disliked, and in fact I think they did so subtly and interestingly.

I think if you enjoy action and fun sci-fi without comparison to the older show, you really could enjoy this a lot. Look at it as a new show which it is and enjoy the ride !",24 December 2021
Did they shutdown all the daily soap opera series? The script here is just like watching a soap opera so they must be the writers. Seems to be all about women's issues/power and how they feel about it...,2 December 2021
"I've been a fan of the serious from TNG. Never cared for the original, find it boring. Watched all episodes of every series since and every movie and have enjoyed them all on various levels.

There is nothing worse about the series than the ""fans"" and not most normal fans but the very small minority that are a bunch of rabid haters who will never be satisfied. They hated Enterprise, they hated Voyager and now they hate this... SHOCKING

The show is fantastic, I personally prefer it over the new movies (is that ok?). I also think this was made for a wider audience to enjoy and so it should be appealing to more people, which is good, because that means we continue to get seasons of Star Trek and not another cancelled series for no good reason :)",18 January 2018
"I like how ppl talk about science. I am not a geek to understand and recall if every scientific methods and theories used on the show are accurate but i still love it. I love how they developed bond amongst each other. i see why viewers hate michael burnham's vulnerability,but hey she should be vulnerable, as she is human. some storylines may be very basic, and predictably favorable but i could not complain. It's good entertainment. The show takes me away to the universe whenever im watching it. i find Jett Reno's sarcasm funny.

Dont expect super hardcore interstellar level of show on star wars so you wont get disappointed.",18 November 2020
I loved it i hope they make more i don't care what they think it was great i can't wait to see more,12 June 2018
"If you're looking for new episodes of a Star Trek series you used to love, this is not the show for you. If you are, however, just looking for a good sci-fi show, I highly recommend ST: Discovery. I'm 4 episodes in now, and if the makers manage to keep up this level I will religiously watch every episode as it comes out. The casting, acting, and camera work create an atmosphere that will grab you and keep you hooked. The characters are believable and likable. The story lines are interesting, and keep the suspense high at all times. If I have to give one downside, it's that the Klingon language is not easy to listen to. I've noticed a very loud minority giving bad 1 star reviews, but note the average rating is still very high. It's worth a look!",9 October 2017
"This show is an example how politics shouldn't be done. Looks like the main goal of the script is to spread diversity of all kind and put the story behind it. No, story is number one and after that comes the politics. Now there's very poor story and very bad acting - but it's not actors fault - the characters are so shallow and non-believable. Diversity is too much on the nose. Yes it should be there but not like this.",2 December 2021
Season 1 didn't feel at all like Star Trek. I hated it. But Season 2 it became the Trek I know and have made it into something worth watching. I can't wait to see where they go from here,21 April 2019
"To watch a show I love for its accurate and sometimes visionary science and a crew played by actors so well that I actually cared about what happens to their characters turned into this Dr Phil drama.....

With the exception of Anson Mount as Captain Pike and Anthony Rapp as Paul Stamets, this series' crew can happily face the same fate as the Red Shirts, I do not care!

The characters and dialogue is dull and unimaginative, Best way to watch, it is without sound and enjoy the special effects and VFX. That is the only way to watch this cruel parody on Star trek.

Why do TV writers dislike Star Trek so much? First Enterprise than this drivel. I guess haters (the writers) gone hate (us trekkers).",8 January 2022
"I know that many Star trek fans are vocally angry because of the tone of this series. Even though I wouldn't have minded a slower paced scifi show with some more time to think I understand the decisions that had to be made to make a decades old concept appealing to today's audience. Maybe it shouldn't have been named star trek but money is without a doubt a reason for this decision.

I found this to be a fun, action packed rollercoaster ride that didn't dare to dictate morals to its viewers but allowed me to think about interesting characters, situation and questions.",27 January 2019
"I cant believe the negative reviews here. It seems so many people wont except any type of change. Star trek could use a boost. But ofcourse theres always the haters.

This show is totally edge of your seat exciting! LOTS of different things happening . Lots of MIND BENDING concepts! Give it a go people.",10 February 2018
"I'm not a big fan of star trek, but I'm into sci-fi and so I check out whatever tv show or movie I can find. I've seen some episodes of various star trek shows and I guess I've seen all the movies (and happen to only kinda like the last few installments).

Quality and entertainment wise, Star Trek Discovery's first season gave me the hell of a good time. Sure, it could be named completely different. Like 'Discovery' without the 'Star Trek'. While reading all the negative reviews, that seems to be what keeps this away from being a great success: it doesn't feel like Star Trek - and thats good in my opinion. I happen to like the atmosphere, the well developed characters with all their flaws and the visual approach of the cinematography - as well as the pace. I literally loved everything about this season except for the awkward escape/rescue sign from the first few scenes and that one time loop episode which came way too early on a fresh installment like this.

If you're not into the Star Trek franchise at all, give 'Discovery' a chance. It deserves a lot of love. If you're a die-hard trekker, knowing all history and time line events of the Star Trek universe, avoid it.",21 December 2017
"I found this quite enjoyable. The 1 star reviews are very interesting and I think people remember the older Star Treks how they want to remember them, but really they were frequently the adventures of Kirk (TOS) or Riker (TNG) hitting on an attractive lady. Voyager and DS9 were a lot better, but TOS and DS9 had a lot more wooden acting. The characters in Discovery are far more believable and 3 dimensional. One thing that did bug me was the Klingons. I'm not sure why they were changed so much. The writers also need to keep their eye on the ball for plot holes. What self respecting 32nd century starship lets an asteroid hit it without any warning?",23 April 2021
"Not like the very first star trek, wich I also liked, but I was much younger then and for the time it was produced in it was of course outstanding. Now, at last it is a grown up version, with an interesting plot and characters who are as well thought out as in the first Star Trek . When I heard about this new series I was really, really, really afraid it would be just like all the over ones that followed the original series. Too goodie goodie, too harmless and always the same story-plots, thankfuly it is not. This one has a more sophisticated plot. AT THE MOMENT (Iam still in the process of watching season one ;-). I hope the producers don't change the series because of all the bad reviews of those who liked the original better. I do suspect one reason for a lot of the haters might be, that there are so many powerful women characters involved and nearly forgot, some gay characters. (but they main chieftain ist a man again, which was of course the right decision from the producers of the show;-)",1 May 2019
"The Star Trek name will forever be tainted! Please save the legacy!

60 years and this is what the new makers bring. Poor writing. Poor character development. Poor acting. Poor direction. Not to mention, zero presence of the old star trek values...not star fleet graduates, but star fleet junkies...",22 November 2021
"I LOVE StarTrek. Grew up with it and it is where my love of SciFi started. Over time I started to hate the correctness of Startrek. The Unlogic sometimes. Till Captain Archer I have watched every show. StarTrek Enterprice killed it for me. The almost doll like characters.

And now StarTrek Discovery. I was a bit afraid of watching it. The Klingons that where not like I wanted them to look like. That new drive that is never mentioned in the series. This is 10 years before Kirk,eummmmm? They have a Holodeck that was brand new on the Next generation? Euummm? Some big mistakes there.

But if you look beyond that. Sit back and watch without prejudice. Forget that Gene Roddenberry is turning over in his grave. Then you have an amazing show with great and deep characters. Forget it is StarTrek and you can enjoy the best Scifi show in a long time. I love this!",23 October 2017
"I thoroughly enjoyed it! The story line is clever and gripping. The acting is great. I really don't know why people are hating over it so much. Sure, it is a new take with a captain who does not have the moral high ground at all times, but hey, that is something truly new isn't it? The only thing I don't like is the new look and feel of the Clingons. When I first saw them I spontaneously thought of the Urukhai-orcs of lord of the rings. I also think their movements are a bit wooden. But apart from that- it is well worth to be watched.",8 October 2018
"I love any show about space travel. I am a big Star Trek fan but wouldn't say I'm a die hard like most reviewers here. Perhaps if you fit in that category you might have stronger opinions about this show. But if you just love space and interesting characters and cool storylines, you'll probably really like this show.",12 November 2019
"I remember when TNG premiered 30 years ago how aghast fans were. Trek without Kirk and Spock? A bald-headed, Shakespeare-loving Frenchman commanding the Enterprise? And speaking of the Enterprise, there are families on board??? Blasphemy said the fans! TNG wouldn't last one season. Well we all know how that played out seven seasons later. And the same with DS9, Voyager, and even Enterprise. Discovery will find its own footing and I'm already encouraged from what I've seen in season 2. Trek in all its forms is at its best when it explores the human condition, and I think if Discovery continues to remember that, it too will Live Long and Prosper.",23 February 2019
"For starters Bernamn is a horrible character, hard to watch let alone root for, which sucks because I enjoy the actress in her other work allot. Discovery is nothing more than a Star Trek series intent on excluding white males from main plot points. That appears to have been the goal and the season 4 trailer confirms great success! When will the show runners take a cue from shows like The Orville that has always put story telling first! Forced diversity and a check box cast ensemble more important than the story itself... that's equals HARD PASS...",12 October 2021
Finally great diversity in lead roles and story telling as well. This is a great representation of what the Star trek family.Yes! More please 😘,12 November 2020
"Now imagine all the training the go trough to get there ranks and then there is real life situation they are in other country doing the job and bombs start to drop. All the female military persons will start to hold hands and start to talk there feelings about what is happening and some of them are crying in the progress.

I actually cant imagine the scenario like that in real life. I dont know why that is in this Star Trek as that is also a military corporation between multiple different alien races. And they should be best at there field in that ship. Never mind that there captain at season 4 the Mighty Burnham lived most of her life in Vulcan where is a culture of people that suppressed there emotions and try to think logically. How on earth coming from this type of culture your weeping and crying every moment you can in this series ? Like how does it make any sense ?

Modern day star trek is lots of CGI action with lots of explosions and laser fire and in the same time they cry and talk about there feelings.

Like in this 4th season episode 2 they are flying inside anomaly and they have time to talk about there feelings while they should not have any time to think about anything other then how to survive in there.

Also the part of diversity is that there is a lot of people in color and mostly characters are women that are super sensitive emotions weak people. I would not say anyone in there is a strong female character as strong female character dont cry most of the thime or whisper or anything we see in there. Janeway from Voyager is a good example of a strong women. Also there are few man in color who get like few words in a season to say. Other man we see are mostly killed off and we dont see diversity in this show as politically white male and women dont fit in the diversity.

Now for the people who rate this with 10 points.

You people are trolls who have no sense in what is actually good. You also dont review the shows or movies and your just here to give the maximum points and whine about other people who actually give a review while calling them as trolls.

This show can be what ever teenage drama show in space but it's not Star Trek. It has nothing in it that we have seen in the past 50+ years. The writers for this show got the job only cause of tokenism as they have no talent what so ever to write science fiction. They use fancy technobabble words while dont explain the meaning but the word just sounds good so they go with it.",28 November 2021
"As stated, Discovery stays true to the original concept. It fills the void perfectly and feels exactly like a Star Trek series should.",17 May 2020
Absolutely loving the new season of Star Trek discovery don't see why folk hate it so much give it a chance let it grow let it get under your skin I absolutely love the humanity in it something that is lacking in the modern world,13 November 2020

"I'm 39 and I've loved Star Trek across all it's iterations and have watched it for as long as I can remember, started with watching re-runs of TOS right through to the new movies and beyond (I mean beyond Star Trek: Beyond). Discovery looks a bit different to what we'd expect for a pre-TOS series, but it's made for an audience watching in 2018/2019. It needs to look futuristic what we have now (which TOS tech just doesn't) and also needs to not look cheap and cardboardy. They have a budget to work with to produce amazing visuals and the production value in DSC is outstanding - movie quality CGI each and every week. The writing team give more than enough easter eggs to keep the fans happy (without descending into ""fan service"") and the acting and directing is some of the best I've seen in Trek. It's an evolved Star Trek, made for a new TV audience, which isn't satisfied with what's on TV when they're stuck at home. We have more choice for things to watch, and Discovery has to grab our attention - and so far it has. Season 1 was outstanding, and Season 2 has so far surpassed that with some of the best episodes in all of Trek's history (Anson Mount's Captain Pike is simply a joy to watch).",8 April 2019
"Omg!!! I love it Star trek discovery is by far the best Star trek show of all time. I am so pleased with the show and happy Michael Burnham finally became captain and falling in love with Booker ""go girl"" the show writing is beautiful. There are some relationship types I can do without morally, but all in all the show has a lot of good moral values.",8 January 2021
I love this show! I'm a big star trek fan so this is just wonderful. I really miss the motion pictures so this fills the void. Keep them coming!,11 June 2020
"This is pretty good, maybe you won't think it's a 10, but it's definitely not worth all the 1 ratings. It's fresh, fun, new. Enough with ratings of 1 from people who didn't watch past the 1st few episodes! I did, and I would give it a 10, and no rating system I know of would EVER give this a 1!",7 October 2018
"I've been a fan of Star Trek since I was a little kid, the show is great!

Don't listen to the negative reviews, give it a chance. Some people just do not like change.",14 April 2019
"I have watched Star Trek all my life, since the very first pilot, and the only time I was despondent about it was when Enterprise was released. A soulless, characterless actor with drab plots and incoherent overall episodic strategy. Cue Discovery and I had high hope for a better show and sadly that hope has been dashed. Star Trek is all about bright, shiny, hopeful, idealistic stories with a moral and a humanitarian theme and an optimistic view of the world and the future. Discovery is pessimistic. It's dark, brutal, unforgiving with no moral really in each episode. In fact instead of the traditional and much loved format of a story per episode, we now get stories which span 5 episodes. That's not story telling, that's lazy and unimaginative writing. They say every good thing must come to an end, and I am sad to think, but I do believe, that Star Trek reached it's end the moment Janeway blasted through the wormhole and back to the alpha quadrant. Never again will we see steadfast captains promoting heady principles and standing strong as beacons of leadership. All we will see is over produced films presented in many sections played by mediocre actors with no real cohesion or grounding in the ethos of the Star Trek world. Farewell Star Trek, your influence on my life will remain even though you are no more.",18 October 2020
"I really enjoyed the old films as a child and still like to watch them from time to time now, I've enjoyed some of the TV series more than others, while most were entertaining they often lacked depth and grounding. The movie re-boots were fantastic to watch as an adult, major advances in special effects making those possible, I've never been obsessed about the lore etc so can just take all of these movies and TV shows at face value and enjoy them for what they are, entertainment.

Discovery is an engaging and much darker work than almost all of the previous movies and TV series, some of the reboot movies are closer in feel and direction.

This series feels real and visceral, not the comic book like cleanliness, bloodless or the jovial swashbuckling bravado of the original TV series (think the lone ranger or the magnificent seven). It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination but then again I can't think of another TV show that is, the closest to date is probably GOT.

If I had to sum up this series in one paragraph it would be:

The blacks ops/dark version of the Star Trek universe which does not pull any punches and gets down to the business of entertaining without being bogged down in franchise accuracy. Check your nostalgia at the door and enjoy the ride.",5 October 2018
It had its moments but overall terrible show the show is full of current political bologna it's supposed to be entertaining and it became current events.,24 March 2022
"Lead character Michael Burnham is one of the best of all the Star Trek series. Saru started out weakly but developed into a pretty good character. Philippa Georgio is AWESOME. Third season onwards were a great twist to the standard formula.

HOWEVER, I feel like they are overcompensating with the diversity. Half the cast is gay or non-binary. Almost half the earthlings are African. I think they do themselves a disservice.

That said, I do appreciate the diversity when it isn't so obvious. For instance, Sonequa Martin-Green is awesome and her race doesn't detract at all. Stamets and Culber are gay, but that also doesn't detract. So is Tig Notaro's Jett Reno which also seems ""organic"". But then. Adira and gray seem gratuitous. And then it turns out Tarka is too.

Whoever is running this show has gender/sexuality fluidity on the mind and thinks this is the norm. I have no issue with it, but Star Trek is a show where diversity is commonplace, not one where it is the star of the show.",21 September 2022
"I'm 65 and a Star Trek original massive fan. When TNG came out i was very much against it but found myself loving it. It's been the same with all the new versions of the Star Trek universe. Some are good, some are excellent, some are so-so. I have however, kept an open mind unlike some on here. Is Discovery the same as the original? Of course it isn't. Does it have interesting characters and storylines? In my opinion, yes. If people are fixated on the original series by all means go back and watch it, but please don't think stagnation is desirable to everyone. I for one have Wally enjoyed Discovery and the end of season 2 was amazing. I will stress that this is purely my opinion but at 65 years old and a long time Roddenberry fan I think I'm entitled to one.",6 October 2020
To some this is sacrilege. To me it's a new era of Star Trek. Season one was good but didn't exactly enthrall me. Some of it was excellent but a lot was a bit meh. Then season 2 dropped and anson arrived as pike and suddenly this was Trek again. True to starfleet. Perfect in every way. Anson deserves his own season. Season 2 had me enthralled and eager for the next episode. Star Trek has been a beacon in my entire life and this expands on it even further! I love it! Anyone that criticises it is not a true Star Trek fan. I am so excited for this new era of trek!!!!,26 January 2020
"This show become more concerned with advancing a politically correct narrative than putting out a good story. The first two seasons is the make a lot of mistakes as far as the Star Trek timeline are concerned, the only brief time this show was at all intriguing was season three when the Christopher Pike, Number One and Spock were brought into the show. This show is barely worthy of the Star Trek name.",20 March 2022
"Continuity and other matters aside, script wise as stand alone Sci fi in a trek universe, this is the best written show I could have ever hoped for. Leave your prejudice aside and enjoy it! I loved it from the first episode to the last. People love to moan a lot and glorify everything past.",11 August 2018
"Couldn't get any worse its a struggle to get though each episode.

I've watched every Star Trek series and movie nothing comes close to how bad this is.",13 December 2021
The first thing people need to understand is that this series is totally different to other Star Trek series' and you should not compare it to other Star Trek series'. It is unique in its own way and has a brilliant story line never mind the camera work and CGI effects. I would definitely RECOMMEND this show for all science lovers.,21 April 2019
"OK i'm reading all the negative comments and while many have merit, I think a lot of the comments could be aimed at ANY pilot episode of any genre. Only over time can you start to get that intimacy with the characters that we all crave. There is a general awkwardness about the crew and other characters, stiff and a little try hard at times, but with time this will dissipate. With regard to the overall aesthetic - the quality of the FX are excellent and the environments, ships and characters of a very high order indeed. Hard to comment on the 'story' at this point, but a promising start. I say let's all pull our necks in a little and reconvene after the dust has settled and see how we feel then. My credentials - grew up up with the original series and watched every film and variation in the ST universe. I'm a Trekie and proud of it.",25 September 2017
I'm a real fan of Star Trek and I'm not disappointed by the Discovery one !,29 March 2019
"There is no need to try and ruin it for the rest of us. But what i would every fan encourage to do is to really look! It's all there.

Discovery gives us characters which are faced with questions like: Who am I? What makes us Human (or any other featured species for that matter), and how far am I willing to go to do what I think it's right?! Embedded in a world where gender and LGBT equality is the norm, where diseases, capitalism, racism and superstition is a thing of the past and humanity is free to explore the universe, inner and out. In this future we made this our world. That's always been the core of the Star Trek universe. We've been given characters that struggle with this questions ant struggle to find a place in this world. In a Universe that is not free of nationalism, greed or sheer evil. For those who say ""Star Trek has never been about War"". I think you're wrong. It's always been about bad idea vs. good idea, logic vs. emotion and that is what I love about Discovery. From the inner conflict within a character to a massive war it's all there and every player has its motivation. Set in magnificently designed sets, accompanied by a squad of intelligently chosen, outstanding actors dressed in top make up and wonderful costumes. I was hoping for this since I first watched Star trek as a boy and now there is! I enjoy the hell out of it, hopefully I can do so for a long time!",7 January 2018
"With every season and every episode the series got worse. The CGI effects are nice to look at, but the whole story around them is really unbearable.

I don't know exactly how to describe the lack of any real emotion in the series. Maybe like this: artificial, inauthentic, unbelievable and sometimes even embarrassing.",18 February 2022
"Ok, if you are in to TOS and want the same don't bother. But if you liked Voyager, Enterprise and the latest Star Trek Movies (based on TOS). Give it a try this is the best ST tv-series ever made. Do not let the old bitter generation get to say, test it and give your own opinion. My opinion is: New thinking, Very good story, effects and again simply the best Star Trek tv-series ever made.....",13 February 2018

"Suspenseful, fast paced, thoughtful, and dense in world building - this newest incarnation of Star Trek has been amazing to watch. They've done credit to the existing cannon (difficult to do considering on where it's place in the timeline) exploring a key juncture of federation history. The Characters are so vibrant and diverse, and the writing is a delight to see unfurl onto the screen. The darker tone serves the show well whilst still feeling very Star Trek in the values and themes it sets out to explore. It's refreshing but so true to source. Every subsequent episode has been a suspenseful delight to watch!",15 January 2018
"Discovery goes back to the pre-Abrams times and its quite refreshing. I grew up loving TNG, DS9 and Voyager but looking back at them I don't feel so connected to them. Perhaps that's because TV writing has improved so much in recent years.

That being said, Discover has those elements of being a continuous story. After watching one episode you'd sell your brother's soul to a Ferengy to see the next.",5 October 2017
"Excellent sci fi, best of Star trek so far. Do not understand how it got so low grades. Totally undeserved",24 December 2017
"I love all the reviews that make statements based on 1 or 2 episodes. DS9 took like 3 seasons to hit its stride. Take your time and enjoy Discovery for its own merits.

I think I was very lucky that I was out of town - and was not able to watch until Episode 3 was out.

If I only watched Episode 1 and tried to make a judgement, I would be completely wrong. The show takes a hard LEFT at the end of Episode 2 - and we really aren't introduced to the real crew / ship till E3.

Even in these 3 episodes, you can feel actors settling into their characters and the show starting to find its feet.

Enjoy the ride for what it is :)",6 October 2017

"The old timers on here giving it 1 star simply don't want a new show. They want a carbon copy of the old TNG series. If that's what you want, then just re-watch them! That's what I do!

I for one do NOT want another TOS or TNG or even Voyager. I love the new take on the tech and I can't get enough. Every time I re-watch TNG, I feel it is so ""antique."" For example, when they opened Data's skull, I see those old large LED with wires flashing which looked like a Christmas tree lights. Most view screens on TNG are static panels with florescent back lights! I chuckle sometimes when I re-watch them and think to myself how could I have thought that was cool. Sure, 20 years ago, that was ""passable"" but today, no way. An update to the tech only makes each new Trek series more believable.

I do see the love appeal of the old Trek series. That is why I still re-watch them. I've watched TNG and Voyager at least 3 times each now. But they are certainly not better in every way to Discovery.

It takes a few episodes for any new series for one to get hooked. In fact, Netflix has a list of how many episodes it took to hook most people on a number of their shows. I checked this list and most came really close to my personal episode list.

IMHO, trying to judge a new Trek series by wanting a clone of the old shows just doesn't make sense. One reviewer claim there was no character building. Seriously? There are only 3 episodes! How do you build characters with 3 episodes? If you re-watch the old series, you will realize it took many episodes to fully build a character.

Don;t bother to place your hate if all you want is a carbon copy of the old shows. However, if you have an open mind and love the updated tech, I'd say give this one at least 6 episodes before you come and write a review.",6 October 2017
"With Klingons that look more like the Jem'Hadar, Federation ships with the bridge hanging under the craft and a credo so divorced from 'To boldly go.."" one has to seriously ask if a class action lawsuit against the producers of this dross, for this death blow to culture, is viable.

Great, another space-based action fodder for our cherished millennials, but why on earth call it Star Trek? Obviously this ain't it? And that's forgoing the staggeringly wooden acting, horrid writing with jaw-droppingly bad exposition and across the board miscast actors.

If you really want to sodomise a beloved franchise so badly, why not go all the way with the political correctness agenda and post-modern junk science and just flat out paint the picture for us.

Let the Captain be a 7 feet tall woman sporting a moustache who refuses to be called 'Sir'. Let the first Officer be a black, lesbian Muslim wearing a yarmulke. Let space exploration be replaced by the quest for gender identity. And lest we forget, lets always refer to space as safe space.

Gene Roddenberry probably never heard of the term social justice warrior, nor would he have wanted to. Because if these people would have their way, the character of Kirk would be chained behind a large SUV, his ripped-open corpse hauled around town while pink haired mercenaries chant ""Death to the patriarchy"".",1 October 2017
"I've watched Star Trek my entire life. this series reminds me so much of Enterprise showing of some amazing technology with a mix of DS9. The writing is great, I have never been so excited for a Star Trek Series. I am so excited for season 2 and I know all the real reviewers on here are hoping for another 7-10 sesasons of this season. Really hoping they connect Discovery with Sector 31 with the spore drive. Heck would have saved Voyageur quite a journey for it not to be a secret :D",19 July 2018
"Don't listen to the silly (trekkie) old-timers who can't move on. They're the ones lowering (unfairly) the score of this little gem we have here.

Realization : 10 / 10
Script / story : 10 / 10
Acting : 9 / 10


At the time of this writing we're at 7.4 mark on imdb, and that is with the above mentioned going wild with their 1 star review. So imagine what sci-fi lovers truly think about this show!

Finally, interaction between characters is still very prevalent despite the drive for a bit more action in the 21st century. I really loved that in Star-Trek and I am over-joyed that they kept it in this new one.

Amazing job!",30 January 2018
First off - the series are great! Second ppl need to understan that there are certain styles in which TV shows are made and the good old days where u get selfsufficient episoded are long gone. Don't hold on to that and moveon... The series make amends and its mostly true to the original especially with season 2 finale... Its great overal show and probably the best space scy-fy atm...,21 April 2019

They know how to tell an engaging story and they do It well. The characters are worthy of getting invested in and the overarching story is exciting. I recommend this show to anyone who likes sci fi and quality. It is truely impressive and I hope they continue for many seasons. Thank you.",15 April 2019
"I really liked this at first, but I can't get into season 4. The LHBT characters are annoying and I have no clue why they are there, what they do or what they add to the story. It seems they were written into the script, because woke.

There are some interesting plot ideas, but the woke interludes ruin the show for me.",28 January 2022
"Everything about this show seems wrong. Technically the logic is all wrong in this show. Technology is incorrect for the time period.

The cast is not great but it's better than DS9, and anything beats Enterprise.

It just seems like this show was really dumbed down like most modern shows.

Season 4 seems... like the tech writers are either 10 year olds, or people TOO old to be writing the technical aspects of the show. I'm not sure what happened here. DO YOU ALL NEED HELP?

Here we are at Season 4, Episode 5 and the episodes keep getting worse and worse with almost zero thought put into the script. I'm kind of wondering if they are even using a script or just letting the cast make it up as they go. DONT get me wrong, yes I still watch it... watching and waiting for it to get better and have at least 1oz of star trek logic. Maybe they need to change writers... they better do it quick if they want to save the show.

Season 4, Episode 6... I have not stopped watching this show. It's gotten to the point where it's just extremely stupid. Pretty sad, this show had some hope but they blew it.",18 November 2021
"I've been reading through the reviews of this laughing! It seems that in order to be be a ""real"" fan of Star Trek that you have to hate Star Trek. I'm not a huge fan of the franchise (although First Contact is one of my desert island films) but I am of quality Sci fi entertainment, and this is some of the best I've seen. The production is especially good, with the sets and fx being consistently amazing.

Admittedly it throws out the episodic formula, the result being basically a 10 hour film, but in age of streaming what's wrong with that?

It takes a couple episodes to settle into the characters, but I highly recommend sticking with it.",26 February 2020
"The Boomer's (of which I belong), and part of Gen-X are showing the same disdain for progressive television their parents do. Star Trek had the first inter-racial kiss, presented intelligent women, and the necessity for understanding ""the other"" in order to find cooperation between species, or in other words to acknowledge the intelligence of women and people of color. This series takes it to the next level, to acknowledge worth of women, POC, and non-binary PEOPLE. This was truly the five year mission to seek out new ways of thinking, explore other ways of thinking, to boldly go where you have never thought before.",3 December 2021
"This is a solid - more than solid - entry in the Star Trek line-up. It re-imagines, extends, and innovates, but all in a manner keeping with the larger Star Trek universe, marked as it is by constant reinvention and, yes, by progressive politics, which Star Trek has always embodied. If you like TNG, DS9, Enterprise, etc., you'll enjoy this, and maybe even love it. My wife and I definitely have. And it looks amazing on an OLED TV, I might add.

And as a White person myself, I must say very directly that many of the written reviews here are absurd, the product of triggered / fragile White alt-right trolls and Tucker Carlson wannabees, Russian bots, and purist fanboys, the same type that can't, e.g., wrap their small minds around seeing black people in Star Wars.",4 November 2019
"I think many of the ""reviews"" on here that give an undeserving 1 score are disappointed by the fact that the formula that the previous four series' mostly adhered to took a radical turn. maybe im just an old fart that's easily wow'ed by flashy cgi but there more to it than that. before i continue, seriously, the fx are terrific. many times i have to remind myself that i'm not watching a movie. i have to admit that when i first heard about the show and its premise i was a bit skeptical until i gave it a try. i didn't warm up to it right away. the first season took its time to ramp up but when it did it didn't disappoint. in the second season, captain pike was such a great captain (portrayed not unlike the charming and dependable but clumsy james t kirk). by the end of the second season, it feels like a gaping hole in the history of the original star trek universe was explained believably. i will definitely be there when they all return for season 3 considering where the story's heading now.",29 March 2020
"When Star Trek The Next Generation began I was apprehensive but soon grew to love the show. With the other shows that followed (Deep Space Nine, Voyager, Enterprise) I enjoyed each one immensely. So I was excited about Discovery. I watched the first episode and wasn't impressed. But a single episode is often not enough to judge a show on so I gave it a chance. After a few more episodes left me with no desire to watch any more I gave up. I've heard that season 2 is better but I'm not going to sit through a whole season of mediocre to bad episodes just to get to the good ones.

So why don't I like it? For starters I found the main character unlikable. I know it's not the actor's fault since I loved her character in The Walking Dead. As I watched the show though I just found her to be un-relateable and lacking in any warmth. The show seemed to follow the same pattern. Superior officer makes a decision. Main character arrogantly says they're wrong. Main character is proven right. I know she's supposed to be educated by klingons but Spock, Tuvoc etc all had enough warmth without being so annoyingly perfect. Every other show had a protagonist (Janeway, Archer etc) who showed strength while also showing enough moments of warmth and weakness for the audience to connect with them. Even Picard who came off as stuffy and rigid at first quickly showed there was a lot more to him than that.

Now the Klingons. Why oh why did they make them like that? No good reason has been given for changing them from the other shows (budget and technology constraints were the only reasons they were different in the original). Why did we end up with klingons who look ridiculous and speak in a ridiculous slow, stilted way. They literally sound like actors talking through bad latex masks, which admittedly is what they also look like despite no doubt cutting edge makeup.

Most importantly there's the theme and general feel of the show. The bright optimism of the star trek we know has given way to bleak pessimism. Many things about the show's look are certainly familiar. Uniforms, ship designs etc are spot on. But the general bleak feel. Other star trek series managed to deliver action and suspense without trying so hard to be ""dark and gritty"". If I want to watch dark and gritty sci-fi I'll watch shows like The Expanse or Altered Carbon which do it so much better. Or the excellent reboot of Battlestar Galactica which pretty much popularised the darker, more serious type of sci fi tv series so popular now which Discovery seems to be trying to become. For that matter, perhaps Discovery should have pitched itself as a reboot rather than pretending to fit in to the continuity we know. That would at least explain the technology appearing so much more advanced than what is seen in shows set centuries later.

To sum up, this show hasn't delivered the Star Trek experience we know. It's been said again and again (and with good reason) that if you want to watch a show that feels like star trek, you're better off with The Orville. Which, while more or less originating as a star trek parody, has delivered storylines and characters far more like what Trek should truly be. For my part though, Discovery simply doesn't fit in to the Star Trek universe I've grown to love.",7 August 2019
"I'm older, I admit. I remember watching the original Star Trek. As a fan, I've enthusiastically anticipated every new series. Some have been great, while others were...""meh"".

I must say that this series is quite enjoyable. I have become ""tolerant"" of the younger generations and their cinematic ideals. I'm not sure how to feel about the Mr Spock and Capt Pike timelines; nor do I see why it's necessary to include what I refer to as ""the mandatory inclusion"" of a homosexual relationship, but ok.

Regardless, I think it's a good show.",13 December 2021
"Into a brilliant franchise with poor health.

ST:D has blown all of my expectations of how a 'modern' show in the franchise would become. I absolute love it.

I hope that the yet unnamed Star Trek show featuring Anson Mount and the rest of the Enterprise cast from Season 2 will be equally as good as Discovery.

Keep up the brilliant work!",8 January 2021
Very cool visual effects and interesting story i dont want to spoil it but you know its a star trek product and this means its cool,28 April 2019
"So many negative reviews smdh, for what reason, for trivial stuff? Clearly the set was flawless, costumes flawless, acting flawless, dialogue, script and plot flawless and the opening was thrilling and eye grabbing the closing was seat grabbing and making you want more and to see more, I couldn't wait til to the next episode to see the outcome! I think what the underlying problem of all these bad mouthing nonsensical petty critics is that they are unhappy because (they see people of color in authority and positions of power) the Captain is of Asian decent and the First Officer is of African American decent and the show is clearly all about her lol and the haters, bigots and racist just can't accept it. Get over it or don't watch but don't put out petty reviews and hide behind them when the real issue is Color. Get Over It, It's 2017 and in the 23rd Century we still exist and are leaders in every field!!",11 October 2017

"I wish they would just cancel Star Trek discovery there are so many inconsistencies and somethings were not even done yet in the 23rd century and a lot of that stuff was invented in the 24th century. If you go back to the Star Trek the Original Series you will see some of the technology in discovery and on Enterprise wasn't in Star Tek The Original Series and you go to Star Trek the Next Generation, Star Trek Deep Space Nine and Star Trek Voyager you will see some of that technology that in being shown in Star Trek Discovery is new and or being invented to just have been invented. Star Trek Discovery would have made more sense if it was set after Star Trek Voyager. In Star Trek the Original Series Spock never had Dyslexia or the problems he had in Star Trek Discovery and never had any sisters, and his parents never adopted any children and the Discovery in the original Star Trek looked completely different.",19 November 2021
"I've read a lot of comments where people are angry on the Discovery series cause it's not as the rest of the Star Trek. Personally I think this is the only reason that makes it special. It's because there are few similarities between this show and others.

I really liked it so far because the show tends to be more socially oriented. It looks like they're trying to show more behind those old starfleet protocols. Like, what's really happening to these people, how do they really feel. Maybe there should be a bolder line between the moments when they need serve and to focus on their tasks and the moments when they are off duty and reveal how they felt during those difficult moments.

Michael Burnham is very emotive and I love that because that's the side no one sees on brave people or ""heroes"". This is the pressure that she faces and those emotions are the things ""behind the curtain"" that we usually don't see in our idols.

In other words, imho, another Star Trek series would be a lot more boring, so I'm okay how they did this one so far. It's obvious that it's not everyones cup of tea, but I personally like it so far :)

My final score would be 7.5

(still waitin' for Picard tho...)",16 December 2020
"I won't spoil anything but somewhere towards the end of season 2 the writing takes a swan dive. Season 4 is truly bad. I've my 3rd grade niece point out the glaringly obvious plot holes.

This is not Star Fleet, I mean even Voyager with the crew trapped and isolated did not degrade away from Star Fleet the way Discovery has made this seem.

Did the writers say ""Hey you know what would be a good idea? If the ""highly trained"" paramilitary personnel stopped to ""talk it out"" about their feelings during a crisis.""

The characters have moved from interesting complex diverse characters to two dimensional caricature vessels of whatever socio-political message the show feels the need to give blatant exposition on. No subtly, no complexity, none of the thought or reasonably compelling and though provoking objections as we saw in earlier ST series. Nope. Just blatant exposition, often composed of non-relevant drivel.",25 December 2021

"Now I'll admit that the first two episodes weren't a glorious masterpiece but it was still really freeking good in my opinion. Everyone else is raving on about how they didn't have holographic communication technology at that but they actually did, if you want to see my reasoning behind that go look at the Star Trek subreddit. Everyone's on here writing reviews giving it one star when literally the first two episodes are out at the time of this review. If you judged DS9 on the first two episode I'm sure it's rating would be a lot lower than if you were to watch the entire series. A lot of people consider the first season of TNG to be a bit rough but as it progressed in the 3rd and 4th seasons, people absolutely loved it. All I'm asking is that you people that are quick to dismiss the series as awful based on just the first two episodes reconsider and maybe at least wait until at least maybe 8 to 10 episodes are out to cast judgment on it.",27 September 2017
"This is not what Ray Bradberry ever envisioned Star Trek to be.

This is simply Paramount using the franchise name to make money but not following what the Star Trek ideology was based on.

Being woke is never what Star Trek was founded on, despite the franchise having episodes that spoke to social and moral issues.

And to bring a divisive, dishonest, losing candidate for Governor of Georgia, who to this day has failed to concede the election, as the ""President of the United Earth"" simply shows that sucking up to the left is more important than ever putting on an honest Star Trek series.",20 March 2022
"Yet another victim of the twitter culture police. For a group of people so preoccupied with diversity, the twitter culture police sure do want their media to be totally conformist.

The one checkbox the show doesn't tick off is good, coherent writing.",23 November 2021
"Let me begin by saying that as a Star Trek fan for nearly my entire life and applying its hopeful and uplifting messages into my daily life, I am insulted and embarrassed at the amount of one star reviews already given to Discovery.

I have been following the interviews and articles for well over a year about Discovery and its storytelling goals. How can the pilot episode be judged so harshly when its intention is to set up a much larger story that is unfolding throughout the entire first season? I am well aware that there are going to be some inconsistencies with canon – but this is nothing new in Star Trek. Take Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan for example. This is widely considered the best of all 13 Star Trek movies, yet it contains a huge mistake within the story that recalls Chekov from the original series episode ""Space Seed"". Chekov was never in the episode or the entire first season - which this episode is from.

The apparent improvements in technology and appearances are something I can easily accept. The way I see it, if TOS was created today with the larger budget that Discovery has, we would most likely have the same results. A few details are clear mistakes in the time line, such as the holographic communications channel, but it would be ridiculous to let that rain on my parade. I find that the creators did a fine job keeping many TOS elements intact, such as the props, uniform appearance that blends the Enterprise and TOS series designs, and classic sounds such as the red alert.

It has been stated repeatedly in interviews with the creators that these Klingons are not the Klingons fans are used to – these are a very ancient race that we are going to learn about and their place during this period of history. Again, how can we know all the answers in just the two-hour premier?

All this being said, I had a wonderful time watching these two episodes with repeated viewings. The visuals, sets, makeup, and ship designs are unlike anything seen on a Star Trek series and I am welcoming the much needed and deserved upgrades. Just like the Abrams movies, Star Trek on TV finally feels ""big"" and pulls me into the action. Many of the scenes did a fine job of building suspense and tension, and every commercial break had me begging for more. There are even some unexpected twists in the story. I am also realizing that Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) is already a complex character with a tragic and complicated past, which I see leading to some fantastic character development throughout the series.

To accurately rate the premier of Discovery, one must understand that it is only the beginning of a much larger story. Star Trek has rarely gone this route before – with the exception of season 3 of Enterprise and some larger story arcs in seasons 6 and 7 of Deep Space Nine. Most fans are probably used to the very episodic nature of Star Trek, where each episode was a stand-alone.

Comparing Discovery's pilot episode to previous Trek's, Discovery is one of if not the best. TNG is considered to be one of the greatest sci-fi television shows of all time (ranked higher than TOS), yet it had the worst pilot of any Star Trek series. In fact, TNG did not take off until season 3. Deep Space Nine may have the best pilot with its deeply thoughtful themes, but the acting is about as horrible as anything on Star Trek. Again, if we want to judge the acting of Discovery, its actually pretty sharp as far as a Star Trek pilot episode is concerned.

Discovery just does not deserve all of the one star reviews. Some of the anger is due to CBS requiring a paid subscription to watch Discovery (which I will not comment in this review) and a lot of it is because Star Trek has been ruined in the eyes of so many fans. My opinion is that these are people that can not be pleased. If Star Trek had stayed where it was (which was franchise fatigue after Nemesis and Enterprise) then we would not have had the newest movies or this series. Some say that would be wonderful, yet I find they keep watching each film and now Discovery. This makes me believe that the one star reviews are not realistic and simply an outburst because there happens to be some minor flaws. With 50+ years of canon to follow and at the same time find a way to bring new people into the genre, Discovery is doing a damn good job. Star Trek is still here, and its pushing forward, boldly, still, where no one has gone before.",27 September 2017
"I've seen all the series and when it came down watching Discovery, I wasn't sure how it would fare with so much other good TV on. I was actually worried it would turn out horribly as they were banning reviews before screening, but after watching it, it all made sense.

For me, it covered everything with technology (modernised you could say) and actual character development. The effects were magnificent and I really enjoyed it. It is fandom service? You could say so, but I am enjoying every bit of it.

After the drag that was Enterprise I am glad we have a series with an overarching story arc and more personal development of character. The second half the season was more enjoyable than the first IMO.

"If this were made in the 60's or 70's I'd understand it a lot better, Pink Floyd, Jimi, Janis, drop some A & enjoy the colours. As it is, it's an over the top soapy with too many intertwined overly complex storyline's, featuring too many timelines & way too many ridiculous, serious characters.

"I think Star Trek Discovery is an amazing new show. I am a Star Trek fan and love what they have do here, to boldly take the show further in a new direction to help keep it fresh so the Star Trek can live on. I think it takes hold of you from the beginning and never lets go. This is a very new way of doing a show and I hope this is the future as I think this show is very intelligently done. It shows the evolution of writers and directors grown from earlier great writers and directors. I believe this show is of movie quality, I feel like I am watching a movie. An ongoing movie which I have learned at the end of this series is a chapter in this ongoing adventure. Keep up the great working Discovery team!",20 October 2018
Feels like a movie and brings back my love of star trek. Watch it and be amazed.,26 January 2018
"Discovery is as far from TNG as TNG is from TOS. It has completely abandoned the outdated sitcom formula that was so common in sci-fi for decades.

You know what old format I'm talking about! Where every episode there's an interesting new character shows up that interact with the reoccurring characters, and of course this new guy not who they appear to be or they're motives are unclear, and then the audience find out truth (""ta da!"") and by the end of the episode this new character has to go away forever. The end. ""Tune in next week, when we'll pull the exact same crap on you again!""

Discovery is a modern Star Trek, for the modern age of tv shows. Even sci-fi classics like TOS, TNG, DS9, B5 are all guilty of using this sitcom formula for episodes. In contrast, Discovery's story line have strong continuity; missing an episode will make it difficult to follow the next episode (try saying that about old star trek series lol).

Discovery meets the demand of the modern sci-fi fan in two fundamental ways. First, by successfully creating an authentic Star Trek series that will allow us to keep pretending that Enterprise was never made, but was instead choked in its crib. And second, by NOT pretending that shows like Game of Thrones, The Expanse, Battlestar Galactica and others hasn't upped tv standards drastically since shows like DS9 went off the air. It doesn't matter that its not like other star treks. What matters is how does it compare to shows that are out now.

TNG and DS9 absolutely have shows you should watch again, but Discovery is the Star Trek you should definitely be watching right now. The cinematography, dialogue, makeup, set designs, and fight sequences on Discovery make TOS look archaic by comparison. It is highly watchable show.

CONS: My only gripe with this show is that I have to ignore the obvious anachronisms that are endemic to Discovery. But you can't be too strict. After all, it is just fiction. :)",23 January 2018

"Wow, where to begin, the first season was terrible, the second season picked up and the third season was just shockingly woeful, there is not a single thing I like about this series now, the ships are terrible, I don't like a single character and the story, what a total joke. I just watched the season 3 finale, and I found it really difficult not to just turn it off and come and review it. A few things that really bothered me, the robots, are you kidding me with that? it's Star Treks Jar Jar Binks moment, then we have the holo deck that can see inside the mind of someone, yea, sure, we have Burnham being placed in command of s hip where her boyfriend is a crew member, like that would happen in any other Star Trek, that's just a few things, there are sooooooo many more to pick on. I am a big sci-fi fan, I have almost every series and this has pretty much turned out to be the worst of them and I won't be watching season 4, I actually hope this pile of steaming poo will be cancelled.",10 January 2021
"I was cautiously optimistic at first but after the first epiode that turned into enthusiasm. Cant wait to see the next episode.

The new series feel fresh and up to date. The acting is great and I like how Michelle Yeho and Sonequa Martin-Green complete there roles. And the staging and special effects looks great I am a fan of TNG, DS9 and VOY but I do not compare them with this. Those shows was great in there time but also Star trek has to move forward in development. But I hope a little bit of old star trek also will be present. I hope the new series will last for at least seven seasons.",25 September 2017

While we were watching second episode, my 10y old daughter without any reason told me, dad, this is boring and those actors are bad and not likeable at all. Can we watch something else?

"Being an old fan of Trek, I have seen all incarnations as live first runs. Starting at age 11 with Star Trek (1966), and continuing on until ""Discovery's"" final episode of season 3, in this year, 2021. I have taken each one on it's stand alone merits. Never comparing any one series to the others. That way no disappointment can be had because of any preconception or expectation. So after 55 years of Trek on TV, or in this case steaming, I am not disappointed.

Now this version is not like any other Trek we're used to. So be prepared to go in with an open mind. There is a more realistic view of the interrelationships between the Terran characters and aliens alike in this version. Some with a more traditional view of life that was once was in the 1960s will no doubt have a hard time wrapping their collective heads around these complex characters. But the characters are far more fleshed out with full backstories. And with so many characters, this can be hard to follow. And to make matters more difficult, their are a few aliens that are subtitled, because they speak their own language. So one must pay attention. And be a speed reader!

So here we are. Is this better or worse than all the other series? If you take my advice and go in with that open mind, you'll love it. And as far as this reviewer is concerned, the original series seems a little dated now. My 66 year old self no longer sees the original series with rose colored glasses and a nostalgic slant. No Sir.

"This is a science fiction show, but not Star Trek. In many instances it is more like a very confusing video game using names, places and objects from the Star Trek franchise. A spinning ship that uses spores to go anywhere and high tech that does not exist in other Trek series for another 100 years or more. Poor writing, acting and feminist overtones add to this mess. The show lacks any emotional connection to the characters and there is no bond between them that makes you want to root for them. In Star Trek (TOS) there was a connection between Kirk, Spock and McCoy, but this show fails any kind of relationships.

"Much as I love Star Trek the ethics behind the shows had got stale and boring and the PG nature of the universe was really holding it back. I was some what dubious when the new reboot came out but it turned out to be great (well, at least the first movie was) Now we have Discovery and it brings everything that I was yearning for to the table.

I don't care that it doesn't fit in with the tech time lines of the established shows or the fact that people swear and have sex (OMG!) as they have updated it for a modern audience while still retaining the 'feel' of the universe.

The characters are great, the effects are great and I am loving the proper episodic nature of the episodes so far and the epic feel the show has (I am writing this after watching S01E07) Lets be fair the franchise really needed a good kick in a different direction to get something that was worth watching again.

The spore drive is genius and the homage to Paul Stamets is something I truly wasn't expecting and I think he would be proud! I have no idea if he was gay but, really, who cares and if you do then you should be ashamed as they have handled the character brilliantly.

Personally I find all the negative reviews hilarious with their accusations of terrible camera-work, wooden acting etc. etc. because it is patently not true. The cast and production team are doing a wonderful job and everything is really beginning to gel together.

It has just enough of an edge to breathe new life into the franchise without going over the top like so many shows do these days.

Star Trek has finally grown up and it is wonderful.",31 October 2017
"If you expext and want this star trek serie to be like the old ones, then you will probably dislike this new star trek serie. The serie is made in the same way as the new star trek movies. More action action and lesser story and a lot lesser dilemmas (which I miss). I would say, they try to get it more mainstream, but in the process looses old trekkies. I did not like the first season so much, because I did not like the plot, but I loved season 2. Some of the questions that I had for the serie in season one, were answered in season two. If you can managed to look away from the wish, that the serie has to be like the old ones, then you maybe can start to enjoy it :) I managed that in season two.",22 April 2019
"Love the writing, lots of action. This is not your parents Star Trek. You want that go watch some reruns. Fresh new Trek with intriguing ideas and plots.",25 January 2019
"Coming from someone with basically zero prior Star Trek experience, this is a great show. Great action, slow and steady character development and interesting plot points. Sure, it gets pretty cheesy at times but never enough to stop me from watching. Halfway through season 3 and it's still enjoyable, definitely worth a watch for a sci-fi fan. It seems that die hard Star Trek fans don't really like it however from an impartial perspective it's very decent.",8 February 2021
"This honestly is probably the best start trek I have watched to date. I grew up on The next generation and love that show. So I am going to always more partial to that series. I Have watched most of deepspace some of voyeger and only really the movies of the original and a few episodes. Only about an episode of the series before this one. So I'm not your typical Trekkie fan. With that said the writing, dialogue, special effects and acting is superb. Best acting I have seen in Star Trek since Patrick Stewart and Johnathan Franks.

People need to learn how to let go and enjoy things. Too many fan boys will tell you this is bad because they have built all the others up so much in their head. It's just like Star Wars. The newest ones are the best ones ever created and the lore has created something that is bigger than it ever was.

Lastly I'd like watching a gigantic movie. All the other Star treks would have an episode be separate of the entire series. Where in this new one each season is a giant movie. Watch and enjoy!",18 January 2020
"I won't give any spoilers, but this show is not like the older star trek, and for me that is a good thing. If you are a fan of the older star trek, you're probably not going to like this show.

The story, the effects, the acting... it has everything it needs to be a great sci-fi show, and doesn't fail to deliver. Infact it just gets better and better. If you like sci-fi, you owe it to yourself to watch this. I'd give it 8/10, but seeing all the negative reviews for ""not being star trek"", I gave it a full score. Enjoy a great sci-fi show star trek fans are going to miss. Their loss.",21 February 2018
Who's idea was it to create this rubbish everyone in this show is either crying swearing or acting like a spoilt little child could someone just erase this timeline,6 February 2021
"The entire show is visually stunning. The first half of the season 3 had a little too much crying but the last half was filled with action and a lot ""wow"" moments. The season finale was crazy good. I really hope they come back with a 4th season. Nice work guys!!",12 January 2021
"I Just couldn't justify watching this anymore. And i usually love most science fiction shows, even mediocre ones ill usually give the first seasons the benefit of the doubt and watch them through to the end and if they get a second season, occasionally ill even watch that too.. well that was back when i felt like the genre as a whole was really in trouble and we hardly were seeing anything new being produced for quite sometime in the realm of science fiction.

This show actually made me really upset. It truly took everything that made star trek what is was and what made it a unique science fiction series of shows in the genre that only stargate has kinda had the same feeling of with its exploration, tho many more hand to hand battles and big baddies playing a more important role in stargate and obviously mssing all the things like heartfelt ideas about humanities future. A future where you can truly imagine wanting to live in unless you're a red coat :P

The future of STD (yes.. let that sink in.. ST:D...) Is not a future i want to be any part of at all. DS9 managed to make the only large scale long arc war in any of star trek, still a future i would love to live in.

STD would make me want to live on a holodeck for the rest of my life.... Tho we don't get those in this flashy prequel.. even tho we get... A TARDIGRADE DRIVE.... *face palm of the highest picard order... Spoks long lost sister never mentioned before....... Okay those are small nit picks compared to the massive glaring issues that is.. THIS IS NOT A TREK SERIES. ITS A SCIENCE FICTION WAR SHOW...... I mightve even added it to the long list of series id be willing to watch the first season of and judge it from there because the genre truly is my love when it comes to film, TV and books.. But trying to shovel this down peoples throats as star trek. And then seeing some of the only good reviews being absolutely obviously fake.... Its pathetic. But im not Angry at this series.. Im legit very very sad. They didn't need to fk with the formula of trek to appeal to stupid young people like i have a feeling they were trying to do... There was already enough of a audience out there from old trek, who then would've bought in newer fans with them... To create a revamped fan base of previous series... This show is just going for an entirely new demographic and leaving all the old fans behind... And for that, Im certain it will fail. I implore all you True Trekkie's out there to not watch this in any way that gives CBS money. They need to learn the hard way. Through there pockets. And since its all about franchises in Hollywood, luckily trek isn't going away if this get canceled. Its to much of a money maker. And if this fails enough, they will be forced to give us back the type of trek we all want. A trek where the Klingons are not literal monsters who sound awful, look horrible and make every scene they're in the worst... When in old trek, they used to be some of the best. If that juxtaposition isn't the clearest reason why they made a horrible mistake with this series. Then you should've stopped reading my review awhile ago and should go eat glass if you think those klingons are anything bearable.",13 November 2017
"We are all hypocrits and this show show, shows us that more some of us are left wing and some of us are right wing but normal folk meet in the middle and political issues and a media issues drives us to 1 side or another I think the federation meets in the middle and this amazing TV show, shows us that. Again people have their own views but I have have lived the modern take of star trek this show Is for the modern trekie nor 1 stuck in the past",30 October 2020
"Don't let the ""fans"" kill Discovery because they're too regressive in their consumption to recognize a creation of this quality - one that doesn't come around very often.

I watched Star Trek before and I will continue to watch it now. Some things have changed, but fans are like dull horses running straight and wanting only one. Things are changing so what. Top quality show. All that matters to fans is well thought out and through the continuation of the series will be shown, not giving a chance to an show and that is so stupid. Funny is how people write: that star is not so positioned, that signal is different, the klingons are slow to talk ... so what do you think producers and productions were not thinking about it before making?So you the ""fan"" could only find yourself prominent.",28 September 2017

"Series 1-3 OK, but S4? All yap and no action. Tilly's voice could grate cheese. Please stop talking and just blend.

I have no interest in the personal lives of these characters, unlike other Star Trek series i.e. Voyager, TNG etc.

Hopefully, Picard will keep me from drifting off. :-(",11 December 2021
"I am a sci-fi fan and love star trek. And I also hate PC crap! BUT I really don't understand the bad reviews this show have here on IMDb calling it PC. I read them before watching the show and I was pleasantly surprised by it.

And if you look at the end of the two pilot episodes where they show what's coming in season 1 it looks really good!

Someone complained about the looks of the Klingons but I would say they look much more badass then the original ones. They look more like the Klingons in star trek into darkness.

Another complaint was the PC angle of women in the top 2 positions. But I didn't feel that it really felt PC at all. But even if it did it wouldn't matter bcoz that's only the setup in the pilot. If you look at the previews from the rest of the season at the end of the pilot you will see that the captain will be a man.

So don't listen to all the bad reviews! It was really good! And this is coming from someone who would probably be a Trump voter if I was an American! ;)",26 September 2017
"Season 1 and 2 was good. Season 3 and 4 are bad. Every since they introduced a number of actors including promotion of gender dysphoria makes this unwatchable. Characters have become annoying, frustrating, and say some really stupid things to look smart!

I really had hopes for this series but now it's become a show that makes me feel regret when I hit the okay button.

The effects, ships, technology in the series is awesome, but the acting and choice of characters is sooo bad.

Watch season 1 and 2 but save yourself some time from season 3 and 4.

To the executives - stop promotion mental health issues like gender dysphoria. You are poor leaders when making these decisions!",30 April 2023
"If you enjoyed Deep Space Nine give Discovery a chance. Sure, it's gritty and violent at times. But in order for a television legacy to survive it must adapt and change. This is not your father's (or grandfather's) Star Trek. The Federation is new. Archer retired long ago and Kirk is not yet even on the radar. It's about second chances. And putting women at the forefront at long last!",10 January 2019

"Having seen the first 3 episodes of Star Trek: Discovery I am extremely impressed with the series. I grew up on the original Star Trek and loved it; loved everything about it. I have always been a Star Trek fan.

The only issue that always nagged me about Star Trek was that it could be a bit hokey, a bit silly or too goofy, and that always took me out of the experience. With Star Trek: Discovery it feels like the Star Trek has a chance to fully deliver on its vision. It is more realistic, the characters more believable; the technology is now finally matching the ability to zip around in space instead of ridiculous looking consoles and button and nobs. There would have been no upside to keep those incorrect elements in this series - it never matched concept.

All Star Treks of past have been fun and enjoyable but this is a much more rounded, polished, updated version that it has deserved for decades now.

I have provided an 8 star rating as it is very deserving of it. I am so impressed by all facets of this show that I would rate it higher but it must maintain what I have seen in the first three episodes and if it does it will merit a 9+ star rating easily.

This series has the potential to be the best science fiction television space adventure series ever produced. If you have not watched it yet do yourself the favour and do!",3 October 2017
First Star Trek I haven't 'warmed' too. More like GOT or LOR... AND another Mirror Universe tragedy. Relentless carnage includes most of the main & lead characters. For me it's a total fail. The series has been salvaged by Picard. But if this is the future of the main theme... It's over.,25 July 2020
"First two seasons were epic, but it has turned into the worst trek ever. Absolutely terrible. Terrible storylines, shocking leads just all in all... terrible.",19 December 2021
"This show would rate a lot higher if you took out all the 1 star ratings from pathetic star trek fans! they just want bad acting, uninteresting rubbish to watch and times have changed so get over it! i have never seen so many 1 star ratings for a show of this quality so realistically this is a 9 rated show! get on it! great story line very well acted! hopefully many more seasons to come!",12 January 2018
"I must admit that this show for me is better than Picard. I don't know why ending it... it's more creative and better written show than any other newest Star Trek show: Picard or Enterprise. Maybe Picard brings more money but it is only because old school actors from the old crew Star Trek. I must say that I am really sad that Discovery will end with a fifth season.

When show comes out, I was very sceptical and I didn't want to watch it...it takes 4 years until I give it a chance.

So, now...I was so surprised how good this show is. If someone will write petition for the six season, I will sign it first..",25 March 2023
"I have watched all the Star Trek shows over the years and for the Star Trek purist, this show fails badly. On the other hand for great sc-fi, this show delivers. Excellent CGI, interesting characters, and a intriguing plot line. If you want something closer to traditional Star Trek, try Orville.",8 October 2017
"Trekkie geeks really need to get over the fact that Discovery doesn't fit exactly into the ST universe and timeline. I've watched and enjoyed ST since the original series first aired in the UK (I'm properly ancient), and this is a fine extension of the franchise. I'm only up to 'Choose your pain' in season 1, but, after a shaky start, the season has got into a good stride, and I'm enjoying the darker tone very much. I'm looking forward to completing season 1 and picking up season 2 when it airs soon.",2 January 2019
"If this show spent half as much time on the story and core character development of a few key characters as it does its constant lecturing on inclusivity and political correctness, it would actually be interesting to watch. As it is, every episode is almost painfully cringe worthy.

The emotion it tries to elicit is absolutely never earned. It's clearly contrived. Here, you should be moved and cry at this moment because that is what our characters are doing. This backfires powerfully and is an insult to intelligent viewers.

I long for Star Trek to return someday. This sappy soap opera just isn't it. It's a shame too because the characters actually do have potential.",31 December 2021
"I am a huge fan of the franchise and when asked does Star Trek Discovery have what made the originals so relatable and charming the answer is no. It does however offer us a door back into the universe that few studios have bothered with since 2002 when the last of the TV series came to an end. Yes some episodes are a little... and yes it doesn't have the feel of the originals but it also brings a modern fresh feel with plenty to like while bringing a new fresh generation to this wonderful franchise with hope some will start enjoying series past.

Those who vote 1/10 clearly lack the adaptability to enjoy something new, it really isn't that terrible!",26 March 2019
"How could I not love a show called Star Trek with decent production values, starring some of my favorite actors, about a quantum entangled magic mushroom-powered starship?

Let me count the ways:

-The main plot was based largely on the worst sci fi plot crutch ever: evil alternate universe. I hated those episodes in TOS and DS9 and I hated them here. Except in TOS and DS9 you could ignore those episodes and the rest of the overarching plot would still make sense. STD is saturated with evil alternate universe rubbish. TNG and to a lesser extent Voyager did alternate universe/timeline episodes in a more thought-provoking way. It's a shame if they had to do so much of it that they didn't go a route with more nuance.

-Ret-cons and re-imagining of some of my favorite characters, lore, and alien species. They did the Klingons dirty and utterly destroyed the cultural identity of the Trill. I deeply wish that new Trek series would leave Spock alone. I thought seeing young Spock and Sarek developing as characters would be great. Instead it's like watching a 1980's era soap operas with Star Trek characters shoe-horned in.

-Regardless of how many feats of scripting gymnastics they did to explain away why Discovery was so much more technologically advanced than any other future Trek ship, it all comes off as ridiculous and unbelievable. Not only the ship, but the technological capabilities of other established Trek societies are ridiculous in any context. So much of the plot relies on absurd ""technology"" that is fantasy, not science fiction.

-Officers allowing crew mates to put their personal navel gazing over the safety of the ship and allowing them to derail military discipline is something that can not be explained away by this being an earlier ""Trek"" in the timeline. In no era would that sort of thing fly amongst a crew of astronauts nor in any any branch of the military. In every other Trek a character's inability to stow their emotional baggage and not make it the entire crew's problem resulted in the character being disciplined. Even when it was about something important, like Warf avenging his mate's murder and potentially stopping a Klingon civil war in TNG. He broke the chain of command and was demoted and prevented from ever attaining a command level rank. Warf got in trouble for ignoring orders to save his wife's life in DS9 too. Conversely, so much Discovery screen time, including during duty and even on the bridge, is focused heavily on characters navel gazing in the 2020's fashion, at the expense of telling a story about space exploration amongst a disciplined crew.

-Complete bastardization of the Trek message of hope in hard times, solidarity amongst intelligent species, quandaries about when it is acceptable to interfere with another culture, civilization, or planet and when it's better to mind one's own affairs and let the issue develop without interference.

Even Michelle Yeoh and Tig Notaro could not save this disaster. Please stop calling these generic space opera shows ""Star Trek.""",27 June 2023
"Title is somewhat misleading, but it covers it.

Let me start by saying: most of the Star Trek fans are doing the same as with Enterprise all those years ago.

And after two or three years into Discovery, when the die-hard fans who now cannot phantom a slight change in Klingon accent or too advanced technologies, get used to the show and start appreciating it. The show gets canceled because we nagged too much.

I like the show and it's way under-appreciated. Some say bad CGI, well I think the CGI is just good and the ship looks amazing.

Yeah it needs a little bit improvement (or getting used to). - Klingon accent could be better - Missing a little bit of exploration and meeting different worlds - Small things; like acting could be a little bit better (but give them time)

But all in all; lets not do the same as with Enterprise. Keep nagging about the show that it's not good. And you know what, then after four years, when it gets canceled, it's our own fault again and we can wait a generation for a new TV show.

If we keep expecting these shows to live up to such high standards, which the old shows did not even live up to, no show is ever gone be good enough.",18 November 2017
"The acting isn't really that good but this still ranks as one of the best Star Trek series.

Wow to season 1 and 2. But after watching season 3 I got the feeling of 'Mvaaa'. It's a thoughtful season but the action is lacking severely...,7 January 2021
"After a less than wonderful first series, it looked like Star Trek Discovery was destined for a less than stellar future..... but then Season two happened!

In one of the biggest turnarounds in my memory, 'Disco' had suddenly transformed into something most of us would not have ever dared to hope for so as not to be disappointed. We needn't have been concerned as somebody, somewhere did something magical.... otherworldly in fact. Season two had storyline layers with depth, really well developed characters, amazing cinematic scenes, but best of all.... the introduction (or reintroduction, actually) of two of the most historical characters in the ST universe. Anson Mount's portrayal of Captain Christoper Pike, the original Captain of the USS Enterprise stole the season by a hundred warp driven light years, with Ethan Peck bringing us a Spock it was easy to instantly recognise and love.

With a huge positive public response, support and multiple online campaigns to bring these characters back for a pre-Kirk series..... this changes everything. The loyal and faithful public may finally get the Star Trek future is so badly wants and deserves.",1 May 2019

"I don't understand all of the negative reviews on here!

This is a great series and is most certainly the darkest iteration of the Star Trek TV series. Yes, the Klingons were better in TNG but I think that the combination of the nods to TOS and the up-to-date CGI really livens up the Star Trek universe.

You would also think that Star Trek fans would be glad that the universe is even still alive and that new series are being created, let alone being expanded. I know I am!

For me, this is an awesome series and I hope it lasts for years!",16 April 2020
"Coupled with the new movie franchise, discovery is a welcomed upgrade to the old but nevertheless great TV shows of the past .

With now 2 good story lines delving into alternative universe and time travel you are in for a treat. Old enemies and new allies , it is really star trek reborn, in the present, or past and present day for us .",2 December 2019
"For me, and I think many, Star Trek was always this hopeful message and view for the future. Old Star Trek reinforced an optimistic worldview of humanity and the show also portrayed that the writers genuinely cared for humanity. Things weren't always black and white and there was a lot of grey too. Old Star Trek gave their viewers an intellectual and nuanced view of the world - they allowed their viewers to think for themselves, especially on the moral dilemmas involved. Sometimes, there was no clear answer.

This is why, for me, new Trek(or Kurtzman Trek) is so painful to watch. First, it treats their viewers like idiots and second, it throws out the story telling method old Trek used. Everything is now black and white, you are told what to think and, sadly, the world is constantly in a semi-post apocalyptic state. I think the perfect analogy that shows what the writers are like in new Trek is the episode Muse in Voyager. In this episode, Kelis needs to continuously explain the nuances and complexity of the various species in voyager and their mannerisms. One of the actors cries playing Tuvok, but Kelis needs to reprimand him, because he doesn't understand. The actor attempts to use what's already known to try evoke feelings from the audience instead of trying to understand Tuvok, but Kelis explains that a Vulcan's feelings are subtle and nuanced even if they feel strongly about something. Vulcans can suffer in silence, but the point was not to overdramatise(what new Trek does) Vulcans, it was to actually notice the nuances. I feel as if the writers are this actor. They just don't understand Star Trek. Their methods of swaying the audience seem ingenuine and conniving. All these forced emotional scenes feel more like the writers trying to manipulate you for their gain rather than tell a story out of joy and being earnest. They throw out what they don't like and keep what they do(e.g. The science-y stuff is gone). They throw in memberberries all the time to sway the audience. The writers don't seem to care but if and when they do it's very focused and narrow.

To me, what they did to Star Trek is heartbreaking. The undertone of this show gives the impression that those involved in the creation of new Trek are willing to exploit others(the viewers) for their own gain. Don't be fooled by their melodramatic shallow attempt. There's so much I can say about new Trek that upsets me so much. I think the writers and producers inadvertently expressed how they feel they feel about Star Trek in Star Trek Picard.

""I don't care much for science fiction. I guess, I just didn't get it"" Said by Picard in Star Trek Picard.

I agree - they just don't care or get it.",17 May 2022

"I truly think that Star Trek Discovery is an excellent show with a new and fresh look (reminds me of another great title:The Expanse).The camera looks good,the characters are very well designed,the music and visual effects are also great and the story arc type action is much more suitable for a sci-fi movie series.I highly recommend it and look forward to watch more episodes.Live long and prosper!",2 October 2017
"Whatever you do, do not listen to the grumpy old men in the review section! This show is a different take on the old, rehashed, and frankly tired ideas that have been played out countless times before.The characters are a refreshing change from your grandfathers Trek, the effects are very good, and I honestly enjoyed the writing on the few episodes so far.

If you are looking for the same old Trek, try The Orville, it's like the old Trek with jokes. If you are looking for a new adventure set in the Star Trek universe, with more diverse characters and a new take on things, this is the show for you.",13 October 2017

"30% Burnham whispering 30% Burnham crying while whispering 40% Star Trek canon with better effects.

This show is all the things I love about Star Trek - great story telling, suspense, mystery, action, progressive thinking, alien stuff and everything about space travel - with a new look and 3 seasons in it continues to 'go beyond'.

Initially I couldn't reconcile the 'advanced' technology of the pre-Kirk timeline but the events of season 3 help to sort that out and now I'm curious about what will happen with the 4th season.

My biggest gripe with the show is that Burnham spends most of her time whispering or cry-whispering and I don't see how a Vulcan raised star fleet officer would behave in such a way.

The biggest plus for the show is Tilly. Without her to offset Burnham's BS I'd have a hard time watching, despite the visuals.",3 May 2021
"As a die hard Star Trek fan the show has always been cutting edge. Ahead of its time as far as societal norms. The show started well but the writers of this show have gone so far to include everyone that they have made the mainstream an inconvenient afterthought. White and hetero is the new outcast and fringe.

The there's the dialogue. All the conversations between characters are these hyper sensitive reassuring pep talks. It makes the characters appear to be weak and insecure.",1 December 2021

Can't wait for more.",19 September 2020
To date this is one of the best Star Trek series. The fans wanted Star Trek to return to the screen and it has. Always with every series someone complains yet in this face it's only those stuck in the past that complain. Bring on more seasons as this series just gets better with every passing moment.,25 October 2020
"....the actress who plays the captain annoys the sh.... the heck out of me...

The looking off into the distance when she talks, or the whispering when she's in her feelings, or the almost crying when she's emotional and trust me in her world everything is emotional enough to bring her to the brink of tears. And anything that's emotional (or is supposed to be 'emotional') she acts like it's the biggest human tragedy. I mean damn girl if you hit your toe don't act like the universe is about to fall down.

There are more things that are bad about this show. Like the thick layer of wokeness on this show is unbearable but that doesn't annoy me as much as the acting of the actress who plays the captain.

The sad part is I think it could actually be an interesting spinoff of Star Trek. But the acting, writing and wokeness just kills it all.",26 November 2021
"Truly great series exploring not only space but human kind. I like how the narrative gives us a lot more depth into the characters in an elegant way and brings us unlikely heroes going on great missions. Episodes work well alone and together telling a bigger story; and I think it stays true to Star Trek. ST is revolutionary and this series is another angle, another take, into this great story. Every series of the Star Trek universe does something different but because people seem to have a lot of opinions and a place to put them nowadays it gets a bad rep. I strongly recommend Discovery to both trekkies and non-trekkies alike.",13 July 2020
This is a great version of Star Trek. I was a huge fan of next generation as a kid and this one is great as an adult.,2 July 2018

I also think that Discovery could be a great introduction to the Star Trek universe in general. If you like hardcore Sci-Fi, I would recommend you to at least give it a try!",21 March 2022
"Superb vision on the modern approach to space future and SF in general...old haters, please crawl back into your holes....",22 October 2020
"I did enjoy the two first seasons, and the third was ok.

But the 4, oh boy.

I dont have any issues with, what some call wokeness.

Neither do I have a problem with the captain being a woman of color.

My Main complaint is.... Its so damn boring.

The characters are bland, and in most cases 1 dimensional.

Most episodes almost nothing happens, its mostly just the captain tearing up over her boyfriend.

I would stop watching, but i just love Star Trek so much that i hope it gets Better.",25 March 2022
"I am a big, big fan of the Star Trek franchise, so much so that I have watched all the series and all the movies and although some are better than others they were all entertaining in their own way with my least favourite series being 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'.

I almost never rate any movie or series as I believe in the fact that everyone has their own taste and what will be excellent to some might not appeal to others. However I have never seen or watched any franchise type genre that has stepped it up as much as this new Star Trek: Discovery. The only way to describe it is Star Trek on STEROIDS!!!!!!

And to all the negative comments on the series I say you are lost people. To the Writers, Producers, Actors and Directors and to all involved I say well done you have taken something I did not think I can enjoy more to another level altogether. The work you have done is brilliant, thank you very much for a fantastic Star Trek series.",19 February 2019
"They just lost me as a viewer. It has become a WOKE show with so much time spent dealing with LGBQTwxyz stories. It used to be about meeting aliens and now it's about getting viewers to accept alternate life styles as normal.

2022 - Came back to watch a show about an alien first contact. Stacey Abrams is the President of Earth? That's it! Completely inane and insane. I am gone for good!",5 December 2021
"I dont know why all the Negativity... Its a bit different Star Trek series, and that its good ;)",25 January 2018
"For those of you who hate it, your entitled to your opinion. I respect that. To me this is up there with the greatest of STAR TREK. Period. Didn't say the best, but well up there. It was imaginative to the maximum. Was not just plain old stories, but incredible storytelling. The way the season weaved in and out was masterful. I consider myself a true fan of all that is Star Trek, this only enhances why i love all the series and movies. Keep up the great work.",21 February 2018
"I love the show, just finished the 3rd season. I read that other reviews keep compairing to the older star trek series. Where those series were more a story on its own per episode this is a continous story over multiple episodes. Star trek discovery can perfectly stand on its own between the older series. I believe they did a great job to transform star trek to a more modern time.",12 January 2021
"Just watched the first two episodes and loved it! The directing and CGI is very good, actors are well picked and the make up is excellent . It blew me away it exceeded all expectations. The first two episodes were prologue and the show will really start at episode 3 . This show has a lot in store us and I cant wait for more. Very good show I highly recommend it !",28 September 2017
"If Discovery would try to tell good stories instead of cramming their obtuse social agenda into every episode, this would be a pretty good show. The special effects are pretty darn good. The original series was great because it had good stories while also being inclusive of different races, cultures, and women. The part where Discovery has gone wrong is that the producers think that they must exclude characters that are representative of the majority western population in order to show characters that make up less than 1 percent of the population or even 1/10th of 1 percent of the population.",3 December 2021
"I didn't give this show a chance until it was to late 😞. I so impressed with the characters, visual effects and storyline. Micheal is so cool to me. She is perfectly casted. I find myself cheering for her constantly. I've never cheered watching Star Trek. I've always enjoyed it but not like this. The discovery ship is bad***. The spore drive ability the sleek lines make it the coolest ship in the series. The supporting and diverse casting is a welcome surprise. It just all works. I will have this series on repeat. Oh yeah let's not forget Captain Georgia 😍. I've always loved Michelle Yeoh she brings it as usual. Please find a way to save this show 🙏🏾.",16 June 2023
"I thought Season 1 was a bit touch and go at time, but overall it was cool. Capt Pike was a fantastic highlight. So far 3 episodes into Season 2 and I cannot stand it! The acting and pacing reeks of Millennial dosed unnecessary melodrama. I think I'm done with this show. What an abomination. Horrible...",1 November 2020
"Though sceptic at first, Second time watching it, and knowing what to expect I like it more and more as I see it over again, and it just sinks in. I know it leaves many unanswered questions but everything is very well thought and I'm sure it will all settle neatly in the second season.",8 July 2018
"Season after season, this show has the continuously best writing of any fictional series to date. The writing/stories; the acting; everything about this show is at the top of it's game. I just hope it continues like this for many more seasons, as it deserves.",13 January 2021
Not totally blown away but it's a good watch and the visuals and concept is great. Ignore the low Ratings people have left and watch it if you like Star Trek on any levels..,22 May 2020
"This is the best Star Trek show, The characters are not just one dimensional, and it looks like they fortunately droped, the one new crewmember that had to die in the old shows. The absolutly best thing. is that they have been able to adopt the continuity and style that we see as the new format for tv shows.",29 January 2018
"Watching season 4 up to episode 4 at the moment i can't shake the feeling overly sensitive person or people are responsible for directing and producing this soap opera-like show. There is so much drama that it feels there is only drama. No dark and light areas, no contrast just heavy drama situations, overly acted, overly wise conversations. I don't want to point fingers at the actors but some of them make my stomach turn how absolutely terrible they are at conveying emotion on screen.

I love star trek but this is the most boring series I've ever seen.",5 February 2022
"As much as I love the old format, It was dated. This is a fantastic revamp and I look forward to watching it every week on Netflix. Season 2 has me hooked.",22 February 2019
"Let's stick to the cool space, science and theories. If you want to keep the audience stick to more discovery of nature, space , creatures. Less personal Discovery emotion and feelings, dragging down the episodes. We have to deal with enough of that in real life and in the media.",14 January 2022
Don't listen to the basement dwellers and booger eaters. This show is first rate and a refreshing spin on the Star Trek franchise. It's supposed to happen 10 years before Kirk but feels more like 75 years after. That being said. I won't pay extra to watch-but my friend does! I don't understand this whole concept. It's solid enough for prime time.,6 October 2017
"This has been my saving grace of 2020!

The writing on this TV show is some of the most intrinsically perfect writing I've ever seen on screen!

Perfect cast!
Best costume designing on any Star Trek!
Amazing visual effects!


I would like to say I'm not an Uber fan of Star Trek but have watched them all as they're the perfect entertaining programme! But discovery for me has been a breath of fresh air, whilst giving the emotional links to older series'.

BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO!",9 January 2021
"If you are wondering how this series merits a 7.something rating , I think I know . When viewing ratings try this .. Filter by Rating and select 10 . Glance down through a couple of loads and you'll see 10/10 , 7/10 , 3/10 and 1/10 all being listed as 10/10 . Get the picture . Isn't it amazing how many positive reviews start out , not by praising the series , but by denigrating the negative reviews . Including "" You're are real loser if you don't like this series"" type of review . As I said in a previous review , this series started out showing amazing promise , yes amazing promise . I am so disappointed that it fell apart . I don't have a problem with spore drive that opens the door to universal travel . I don't have a problem with personal relationships , they tend to happen , don't they . But the reality you're describing has to obey some rules , it has to make some kind of sense .",26 February 2019
That this is really really good! I just love it! Completely hooked!,7 February 2019
"I watch Trek for strong characters and action. If these characters were in charge the Federation would've folded in days. They spend more time talking about what's happening and how it makes them feel than actually doing anything. If you cut out all the long winded BS of characters in love with the sound of their own voices these episodes would be about five minutes long. If I have to listen to Burnham blather on for five more minutes I might vomit. Definitely written for the ""safe space"" generation. Please give me a Picard or Sisko speech that inspires instead of this garbage that makes me just want them to shut up and DO something.",1 December 2021
"I'm the first one to hate all the PC BS, virtue signaling and all things related. Honestly I didn't see much at all. We're there some corny parts? Sure but overall the show was really good. And damn, captain pike was amazing. The actor fit the role perfectly, he was made for that part. Michael, yes could be a little much at times but again, the overall part she played was really good. I could go on about the cast but you get the idea. Don't listen to the haters on here about how bad it was and don't watch the show. I almost did and I would have missed out on a great show. Now I can only comment on season 1 & 2, maybe I'll revise this after 3 but the show would really have to take a nose dive for me to do that

Update: just watched season 3. Enjoyed the season for the most part but could really do without the trans and she/they BS storyline. And now reading that grey will have a big part in season 4, idk how much longer I'll be sticking around. It was fun while it lasted though",26 February 2021
"Huge Star Trek fan, liked every movie and series including the first 3 seasons of Discovery.

I find it unfortunate that in series 4 they are overwhelmingly over compensating with woke stuff. Imagine I'm liberal minded in all aspects and this is hard for me to watch, believe me I tried several times. On top of being woke it's a lot of touchy feely, about 95% of the time.

Really unfortunate, they should fire who ever is responsible of the story line. If it continues like this one of two things will happen, the series will be cancelled or they will reset and make something good.

Season 4 sucks major big time.

Really really disappointing. I never wrote a review, I had to in this case because I'm hopeful they will change it.",22 December 2021
"This is a damn entertaining show. Good production end to end. Presenting the makers vision, not all fans will agree. I've seen fan trek, I won't insult it, this is light years stronger, end to end.",15 February 2019

"Star Trek Discovery brings Trek up to date in more ways than just special effects. Season long story arcs, fantastic acting, cool aliens and a truly diverse cast that hopefully has a hero for all children to look up to.

Ignore the haters and enjoy some out of this world sci fi action :-)",20 January 2021
"I absolutely love this rendition of the Star Trek franchise, it keeps you on the grasp for what will happen next. If close minded people stop thinking of the 21st century messages the suppose its trying to bring and divulge in their ability to open their eyes and show we are all just people, they have gone through what our world is about to go through if we all just learn to see a human being, not color, or shape or sexual orientation. They are fighting for everyone to know their value and their worth and saving a universe not just one race or sex. I absolutely love this show binge watched the whole thing and nearly clawed my eyes out when it was the last episode. If your an open minded human being and non discriminatory than this show is for you!!! Amazing work writers and cast and crew beautifully done!!!",31 May 2022
"I'm a new Star Trek fan and I've been watching the Star Trek franchise from the original series, so far Discovery has done its job to ruin all that it could have been; great sci fi that entertains. Oh boy... Every character on this series seem to be depressed. They even managed to make my favorite character Spock an emo? However I can still forgive the writers for that as long as Spock and captain Pike are there to keep this ""Star Trek"" relevant. Also, please for the love of god please I do not think Tilly is a good idea of a character to have on board. She is everything I do not wish to be if I was a starfleet officer. And take this from an equity-loving Asian female, this whole series is too politically correct with too many feminist and left wing agenda on screen and worsen with every new episode. It makes me cringe til I cry every time.

Overall, if it wasn't for my favorite characters Spock and Captain Pike to save the series, I would have given it 0 rating.",3 May 2022
"I had my reservations the first two episodes. After episode 3 and 4 I am hooked. Some say this is not true Star Trek anymore. Well, if nothing changed, why bother? I like the different vibe. I like the slightly darker lead characters of Michal Burnham and Captain Gabriel Lorca. Be open and enjoy. I do.",13 October 2017
"Ok so I have talked to my other personalities and we refuse to watch this anymore, until all genders and pronouns of the cat are revealed. I can't even begin to imagine how the furry community must feel, I'm literally shaking right now.",27 November 2021
"Couldn't wait for it to come back. Won't spoil it for those who haven't seen the new episode, but it's a very interestibg twist to the plot line, and I like the two new caracters.",16 October 2020
"Nine episodes in and Discovery is really finding its feet. A lot of the reviews you read on here are based on the first couple of episodes, which were very hit and miss. However, by episode five Discovery finds a pace and a cohesion that quickly sends the quality skyward.

Why you should watch Discovery: 1. The characters are interesting. Flawed yes, not the goody-two-shoes we know from previous Treks but flawed and relatable characters. This is the Starfleet BEFORE Kirk, when utopia was still out if reach and hard decisions often meant hard choices and the characters reflect that.

2. It's darker, more mature tone of its war-set first season is reminiscent of the second half of DS9. If the utopian TNG or often-silly Voyager is more your preference, you might not appreciate this first season (although the show's creators have said that the war only lasts this one season 2 with season two being geared more towards happy exploration.

3. The relationships between the characters aren't always harmonious but do continually develop each episode, unlike many Trek series where most characters remained broadly static from season to season.

4. Serialisation. Things aren't wrapped up in a pretty bow at the end of each episode only to start fresh the next week. Mysteries, problems and plot lines carry from episode to episode (think Enterprise season 3, but more so). Again, this type of TV is for some people but not for others.

5. Updated technology and visuals. A lot of what we see in earlier Treks already looks dated by 2017 technology. Discovery refreshes the technology, once again making it look futuristic and (potentially) inspiring another generation of scientists and engineers the same way the original series did.

6. A delicious vein of dark and sometimes sarcastic humour runs throughout the show.

7. If this is successful, they have promised more series in different times and settings. If it fails, don't expect anyone to take a risk on a new Trek series for at least a decade.

8. It's a LOT more successful than the first seasons of most Trek shows.

Where Discovery goes wrong:

1. The klingons. Not the way they look (I actually like that), but the way they speak. I presume it's the prosthetics but it makes each Klingon scene a bit of a struggle to watch.

2. If you get obsessed with canon, then you'll have a heart attack in some episodes if some other fans are anything to go by (even though every Trek series is riddled with canon and continuity violations that apparently get overlooked).

3. You have to wait for answers. Although we're used to this in TV now, it's a new thing for Star Trek so it may take some getting used to.

4. The first 4 episodes are a bit hit and miss, so you have to stay with it at first.

5. Prepare for more zealous 'gatekeeper' fans to label you as a casual or new fan because you like a series they don't.

Summary: A more mature Trek aimed at a 21st century audience. Yes the changes have irritated the more zealous fans out there, but if you can handle more complex characters, a plot that doesn't give you all the answers straight away and updated visuals and sets, then you will find a smart, grown up piece of scifi waiting to boldly retake you to the final frontier.",12 November 2017
"Impressive graphics, interesting stories. I particularly like Sonequa M-G and her role and transition in the series; I have been a fan of hers since TWD, and she certainly brings her A-game to this show.

As a sci-fi buff, my exposure to Star Trek has been the original series and Next Gen as a kid; I havent watched the several other spinoffs. I believe JJ did a great job revamping the movies, and there is definitely a quality of his vision in this series.

I am half-way through season 2 and it is awesome. Definitely unique premise to Star Trek, and is certainly working to capture my interest.",4 October 2020
If you gave this series a chance and actually watch it to the end you will find it well acted with a great script and fantastic special effects it flows into each episode rather than individual episodes leaving you on the edge of your seat,14 December 2018
"Well, after watching Season 2 I can say there has been an improvement, for one reason - Christopher Pike. He is the only character worth anything. Although Number One was well casted.

There are still 3 reasons this show is not as good as the Orville.

Tilly: the comic relief who would never have made it through a real professional organisation. Simply awful. Burnham: Either blubbering because she received bad news, blubbering because she has to make a decision that affects others, or petulantly demanding what she wants. Basically a teenager ravaged by hormones.

The writing: The writers have decided that Star Trek should be a teen melodrama set in space. They are wrong. They show glimpses of getting it right with Pike and Number One. Perhaps they should reduce the number of writers from dozens, to a few, and see what happens.

Here's to third time lucky with Season 3. Hopefully with less teen melodrama, far less blubbering, and more actual Star Trek.",10 January 2020
"At first, I gave this a bad review because of the staggering amount of melodrama and overacting, all drowning in social justice and PC BS. Much of this is still present, but mostly centered on Sonequa Martin-Green's character of Burnham. She still has FAR too much emotional reaction to EVERYTHING, and I don't know how much more I can watch her walk around with her mouth wide open gaping like a moron. If she would just tone it down, her portrayal would be perfect.

That being said, the show started out like it didn't belong wearing the Star Trek name, but the last few episodes have started to feel right. The writers are finally on board with the way it should be....or so it may seem. Time will tell.

I look forward to more episodes and it has taken a full season and then some to finally bring myself to say that, and mean it.",29 November 2020
"I actually watched the first two seasons and tried to overlook the wokeness of it all. It wasn't easy but the CGI is good and there were some interesting storylines. But now in the third season, I haven't been able to make it through the first episode. I'll try again but the characters and their actors are even more unappealing this time around. Being ex military I find their bearing and respect of rank and orders appalling. The original Star Trek, of which Discovery is supposed to be on an earlier timeline, was faithful to that reality. Discovery is most certainly not. The captain is the worst offender and should have gotten the message from reviewers much earlier. But it's not entirely the actors fault, it's the directors and writers who create and bring us this disaster.",19 November 2021
"I honestly don't understand the huge amount of negative reviews STD received and I don't think a 1-Star-Rating could ever make sense for this show.

The cast as a whole - especially Soneque Martin-Green and Jason Isaacs - did a GREAT job. The plot of the first season had a lot of twists and turns, some more some less surprising, but all of them very well written and thoughtful. The special-effects and the music were stunning but they still managed to preserve the unique Star Trek-Flair.

The only reason I didn't rate it 10/10 was the slight lack of charakter depth in some parts of the show. But all 15 episodes were very enjoyable and exciting and I'm really looking forward for season 2.",9 May 2018
"Guys, this show is great in nearly every measurable way. People are complaining about the stupidest things which im going to try and address.

The look of the klingons. Guys, its a make up change, they've done it before - or does know one remember the klingons in the original series!? Get over it.

The ships appear more advanced then Kirk's ship. The original ship was designed in the 1960's - doesn't anyone really think that a 2017 show is going to take on a 1960's appearance!?

I could go on, but the bottom line is that this a fresh new show catering for old and new fans alike. The show is taking place in the original time line acknowledging events from the previous TV shows as opposed to the Abrams timeline. However, the design of the show is clearly taking elements of Abrams set design.

The show looks fantastic, the sets are gorgeous, its well shot, the costumes and props are also interesting - in fact the starfleet uniforms look great and there were a ton of Easter eggs for long time fans to pick up on.

The two episodes that have thus far been shown are interesting and set a great tone for the rest of the season, i'm excited to hear that Johnathon Frakes will apparently be returning to the directors chair and numerous previous cast members have expressed an interest in cameo roles.

The only negatives, the klingon scenes go on for a bit to long and the dialogue being spoken in klingon with sub titles made those scenes a tad frustrating. Id have just had them speak English.",28 September 2017
"This is the first review I've written for anything on IMDB. It's sad that in 2019 I need to write a review defending a TV show for showing LGBT characters. Before I come onto that I have to say this is Star Trek for me. Many of the themes present in all versions of Star Trek are in this series! My favourite ever was DS9 which like Discovery was often criticised for 'not being Star Trek' but is now considered one of the stronger outings and has some of the highest rated episodes in the franchise. Many of the tones set in that series are in this one and allow people to connect. Our world is not the utopia seen TOS and TNG. DS9, Discovery, Enterprise and to some extent Voyager try to make us understand by putting things we see every day into a format which we can understand and explore further. This leads me on to LGBT characters. Discovery is set IN THE FUTURE in a society which promises equality, freedom, acceptance and embraces different cultures (I think all Star Trek fans will recognise those themes!) - things that are sadly lacking in today's society and in some of the reviews I've read for this series. I find it amazing that Discovery is criticised for showing a normal gay relationship in the same way it would show a straight relationship in sci-fi and in Star Trek... Dax/Worf, Paris/Torres these relationships have been done before, Discovery is showing something different. There's no point in repeating the same old theme which the 90's shows often did. What's wrong with reflecting the world in which I'm hoping gay relationships are becoming more accepted everyday? Very few would ever say that the kiss between Kirk and Uhura in TOS was wrong - so why say it about Discovery? Let's not forget DS9 actually did it in the 90's with Dax and her female on female kiss (although a little more complicated than it sounds!). So for those saying this isn't Star Trek because of what it shows I'd say that you don't reflect the values of any of the franchise and it's probably best off without you until you catch-up!",17 February 2019
"Michael finally evolves into a great character. It's still cowboys in space, like the original series, but up to date and (honest) a show that will carry the 'early 21st century' mark but hey, this is early 21st century. Don't say that you did not watch and than give terrible reviews. This series has more depth than any other ST, but it takes time to adapt. It's no soap the Orville (like it also) but genuine cinema. It's more like the ST movie reboot compared to the original and his spinoffs. So, don't compare but accept that there are 2 mayor brances in the ST legacy and,... don't bully. Kirk never did. Enjoy!",9 December 2019
"Its bad enough the main character is a crybaby, but even the Klingons are emotional wrecks that seem to have a dad story to tell.",2 June 2021
"I do not understand why so much hate? Finally we got a Star trek series with A class special effects and more dark and mature characters. Yes, I have seen all the star trek series and I'm happy to see some progress from the ""super moral and smart star trek officers exploring the universe and spreading (forcing) the wisdom of the Federation to other alien cultures"" to more realistic protagonists. It may not be as funny as the others with amusing and memorable characters but I'm totally with this more ""down to Earth"" approach and so far I like it and i'm looking forward to see how the show will evolve and which characters will pop up next. It is a harsh step from the fable like start trek we knew but a step in a right way. If you don't like this, go watch ""The Orville"" it is almost a parody to star trek but closer to the older star trek series then this.",10 October 2017
"The first 2 seasons were great. Season 4 left me wondering what happened. It's almost as if the script writers were replaced by Kamala Harris' speech writer. Scenes in which the heroes only had minutes to act to save the crew were interrupted by emotional arguments that could have waited. Actors were dodging explosions before they happened. If this series is going to survive, it's going to need to return to good storytelling. The directing could also handle some improvements. Bouncing between upside down and upside right camera angles added nothing to the story, instead it distracted from it. Hopefully the creators will learn from the feedback before season 5, if it survives.",8 January 2023
"I'm amazed there are so many one star reviews. Many of these reviews are ridiculous; ""poor CGI"", ""like Star Wars"", ""Unlikeable characters"". All nonsense if you ask me.

Another bugbear seems to be that the technology is better than TOS, TNG, etc. Well, of course it is as it was filmed in 2017 and not 1967. If they wanted to be ""authentic"" then we'd just have walls of flashing lights, which would, in 2017, be a bit ridiculous. Why not have the captain of the ship fighting bare chested or at the very least in a torn top to show his rippling muscles....

We even get many reviewers become more or less hysterical because the female lead is called Michael. So what? Does it matter? Does it make the show or her character any less interesting? Who cares what she's called and one day we may even know why she is called Michael. It's only an issue if you make it an issue.

Many viewers don't like the idea of the franchise moving on, it seems. They just want a regurgitation of previous series. ""It's not Star Trek"" seems to be a phrase that comes up time and again. The crew ""works against each other"" screams a one-star review. Well, that's what people do. They are stuck on a ship millions of miles from home and so they're bound to go a bit crazy, particularly when in danger.

Now, I'm no great Trekkie. I love TOS when I was a kid and the cartoon series. I liked TNG until the ridiculous Borg starting to appear more and more and I even liked Enterprise. And, annoying to many, I like Discovery too.

I have seen five episodes and I think it is engaging and exciting and am looking forward to seeing what happens next.",16 October 2017
"I have to say I love the show in a lot of ways but I wish at times they set the show in the current day as opposed to being set in the past as if we need another prequel? We really don't need anymore. I'd love to see a current day Star Trek with a lot more modern thinking tech. I love the idea of the spore drive however and I feel it adds a really cool touch to the show and the ship. Having said all of that, they have done a great job of integrating Discovery into an existing universe.

The one major issue I have with show are the Klingons! The prosthetic and the teeth seem to muffle their voices and make their faces look a bit rubbery. Any scene that has a Klingon in it automatically annoys me. I wish they have less prosthetic around their mouths and weren't as muffled.

All in all I am so incredibly excited to see Star Trek back and I really hope they continue to invest in the franchise. Can't wait to see where they bring Discovery!",15 April 2019
"Its amazing how many people dislike this show, as proven in the comments, yet how high the ratings are. Why does this site, and others, continue to have this problem? The ratings do not match the comments left. Its like ratings are coming from people who have not watched the show or something. Hmmm...

This series is yet another example of what is wrong with modern Tv. Its like the writers are living in a separate universe from what fans of Star Trek really want. Its really sad.

1/10 Can it get any worse? Stay tuned for next season. I cant wait to NOT watch this!",16 April 2022
"In my opinion all people giving 1 or 2 star reviews lack the vision Star Trek is about, I am such a fan of Star Trek, far from being a Trekkie but I love all the series and the movies, if you are a true die hard fan you don't rate this that low not this early in the series, I didn't warm to DS9 until late in the first season, I think so far they are doing a great job at reinventing Star Trek the only problem I have is Captain Lorca, I see him as being a lot darker than any other captain, not sure Starfleet would accommodate him as he is portrayed but I am watching eagerly to see where they go with it, the storyline with the Klingons is great, not sure how supposed Star Trek fans are criticising so harshly this early give the show a break, at least see how the first season goes remember with the amount of Star Trek that has been produced it must be difficult to come up with a new series with new story lines to engage the viewer. I for one am excited to see what happens next episode",23 October 2017
"This is by far the worse Star Trek ever. The main character is my biggest beef. Sonequa never seems to make a mistake, every time she makes a suggestion she is always right while everyone else is wrong. I also don't like how they don't let you get to know the other characters much except for Saru. The only bright spot of the whole show was season 2 and the coming of the Enterprise and all her officers and looking forward to their new show. I will be happy when they cancel this show and that is not something I usually wish for.",19 March 2022
"My favourite series is TOS. I Find TNG slow and boring. Discovery is different and I like the continuous storyline. The special effects and drama are great, each episode is like a movie. I'm not sure why people are so against it, be fairer.",24 February 2018
Thank you Star Trek Discovery. Eagerly looking forward to the next episode.,9 March 2019
"Finally a star trek that has a sense of urgency, mystery, fear and above all a real story curve. People will cry that this show is dark, it is supposed to be. The federation timeline was not all roses and unicorns. Finally a show is brining Star Trek to a newer generation. It's mostly the baby booms that are crying, but hopefully they will all be dying off soon.",5 February 2018
"ST Discovery take a different approach with many twists and turns. If you think you know the plot line you will be surprised. There builds a different feel from the prior series that may throw you off, but the writers bring it home. Actors are great and Effects stunning. A variation from the look of earlier series is off setting and the only distraction I had problems with. However, again the actors are great and the investment pays.",13 June 2020
"I am currently watching season 4.

I wish they'd just get on with it instead of going on about feelings, relationships and supporting one another. We all know how they would feel in these situations and we all know that we need to ""be there"" for one another. Captain Kirk would have sorted it out in one episode.

Another complaint, while I've got a few characters to find, I've never liked these insuperable foes who take a whole season to overcome, whether it be the Kazon in Voyager, the Dominion in DS9 or the Xindi in Enterprise. Then, when they do deal with them, you think they could have done that in one episode.",31 December 2022
A lot of bad reviews wasn't sure whether to watch it but I eventually did and I got hooked. Thankfully I can't compare it to the original Star Trek. It's 2021 we all hate remakes but some are worth watching. I found it really good it's interesting.,9 July 2021
"Trek fans seem to have been priming themselves to hate this show for the best part of a year now, and the fact that the two-part premiere was genuinely excellent - far better than the last 4 films, Enterprise and Voyager - doesn't seem like it'll stop them. Strong script, pacing, production, characterization and concept, plus a realistic and complex look at how two societies can stumble into war; this is a show where actions have consequences. Finally the franchise is doing something bold and progressive for the prestige TV era, and attempting its most ambitious storytelling in two decades. Surely that's what fans want, isn't it? You'd think Trek lovers would be excited to have a new Trek series.

But apparently not. It's clear to me that a significant proportion of the fandom wants comfort food. ""Regressive listeners behave like children. Again and again, and with stubborn malice, they demand the one dish they have once been served. A sort of musical children's language is prepared for them: it differs from the real thing in that its vocabulary consists exclusively of fragments and distortions of the artistic language of music. [...] Regressive listening is always ready to degenerate into rage. The regressive listener would like to ridicule and destroy what yesterday they were intoxicated with [...]"" - Adorno wrote this in 1938 about commercial jazz and its enthusiasts, but it applies equally well to fandoms generally, unfortunately including many professed Star Trek fans. You get a lot of people in fandoms who consume fetishistically - treating the object of their fandom not as a piece of drama, art or literature that's supposed to challenge, develop and break new ground, but as a comfort blanket of tropes - they just one that one reassuring staple served to them again and again. Fast food. This would seem to be why so many Trek fans are delighting in the critically-mauled Orville and its colorful brand of fast-food Star Trek while consistently attacking the well-received real thing (and believe me, Discovery is far more ""the real thing"" than the JJ Abrams movies or Enterprise).

I don't think The Orville is terrible, but I do think that at present, there's unfortunately a greater appetite for its brand of lightweight, glitzily produced bros-in-space Trek than there is for a complex and tonally somber prequel featuring two non- white female leads. And that's a great pity; one that speaks to audience entitlement and a failure to treat Trek as what it is and what it was always supposed to be - drama. It only takes a quick look at some of the other reviews on here to see that this negative reception is not based the quality of the show's storytelling, but is either nitpicky in character (writing off the whole series because the Klingons have been redesigned, the ship's design/technology is wrong for the era, or even just the fact that Discovery is set in Trek's past and not its future) and/or has gendered and racial aspects, especially gendered. It's not automatically misogynist to criticise a Trek show with a female lead (Voyager was bad more often than it was good, and Janeway's characterization was highly inconsistent), but there has been a continuous strong undercurrent of misogyny (both dog-whistle and overt) in advance of and now in response to this excellent show.

Everyone who thinks Discovery is decent and that it deserves a chance to thrive, whether Trek fans or general audiences new to the franchise, needs to support it, because otherwise we'll just be stuck with The Orville. Don't let the ""fans"" kill Discovery because they're too regressive in their consumption to recognize a creation of this quality - one that doesn't come around very often.",25 September 2017
"There's been a lot of people dismissing Discovery out of hand, but having done a recent rewatch of all of the series, the first 8 episodes have stood up better than any other live action Trek series' first season to date.

Is the casting ""political""? Maybe. Certainly no more so than that of TOS, where Roddenberry pushed limits in terms of not just race and gender, but also in his inclusion of a heroic and proud Russian character working alongside Americans at a point in history when Russia was unequivocally The Enemy. In short, Trek's always been political, and it's never been afraid to ignore realism (or its own canon) in the name of philosophical exploration. If that's what draws you to Trek (as it does for me), Discovery's worth checking out.",6 November 2017
Written as a modern series with action and personal growth. The old star trek series are awesome but sometimes kind of boring. This is a modern version of star trek and I absolutely LOVE it. It fits perfectly in the star trek universe even though it's new. They brought back so much from the old series and made it work in present time.,9 January 2021
"Sure it's different from previous Star Trek series, but it's fresh and cool. Have seen the first 9 episodes and it's getting better and better. Maybe compared to other series it's even easier to get in. Just give it a chance and you will like it.

Would give the first 9 episodes an 8, but because of all the hate out here I'm giving it a 10!",17 December 2017
"Finally An Amazing Star Trek show that more then makes up for Enterprise.

The 1 Star reviews clearly aren't giving it a chance.

The new Klingon look takes getting used to,. it is explained in season 2 when they have hair again.

Love everything about this show. Can't wait for Season 3!",10 September 2020
"The only characters worth a damn are Emperor Phillipa and Commander Saru. Burnam has her moments, but when each episode's themes are Burnam breaking all the rules, putting the entire universe at risk and being ultimately vindicated by some unlikely magical plot device, it just becomes tedious.

I get it. We need more inclusivity. No problem. We need strong female heroes. No problem, agree completely. But I have yet to see a slight female charter lose a battle with an eight foot hulk. I have yet to see a dweebish emotionally crippled character without any thought or regard to the bigger picture lose an argument against cold hard reality. It is a teenage fantasy written into corners without restraint or purpose. Seriously, not only are universe threatening problems solved in each episode, they are done in real time. All in a days work and I still have time to text all my friends about it.

As other reviewers have noted this is (the very worst of) Star Wars with a Star Trek name. As another has said, I am coming to intensely dislike all of the main characters.

I am not certain I will be able to watch the remainder of Season 4. I have to pause so often and go vomit. Honestly, I'm shocked there will be a season 5, season 4 is so bad.",21 February 2023
"I've grown up with Star Trek, I love every one of the shows and movies deeply, but at some point I admit I thought they wouldn't be able to create anything new or different...

ST Discovery does it so wonderfully. It brings the world of Star Trek to today's rhythm and pace.

It has fantastic characters, new worlds, incredibly surprising and interesting scientific theories (for example the mycelial network), and all under a shape that is no longer a 1-episode/1-story kind of show. The story is a plot that continues through the episodes and the seasons, with neverending new ideas, turning points, great writing, sense of humour, heartfelt relationships, fun and adventures.

Highly recommend if you're looking for something to stimulate your mind and imagination, and to give you hope and happiness as Star Trek has always done!",14 January 2024
"I think the phrase ""Star Trek"" should be removed from the title. Since it denigrates the entire history of the Start Trek series.

I've watched every season since 1966.

And I can conclude that this series is the worst I have ever seen.",13 March 2022
"First of all I want to say that I don't care about problems such as the CBS All Access or stuff like the copyright issues of Axanar, things that drove people to downgrade a long awaited series but have nothing to do with it. Furthermore the first two episodes can not and should not depict the whole series or the future of Star Trek. Anyone who has watched the pilot of TOS would know that. If one removes the nostalgia factor...it was terrible.

With that in mind let me say some things about how I felt by watching this ""pilot"". It was really good! A bit fast, but good.

The story starts by giving you some hints about what Starfleet is and who the Klingons and the Vulcans are and thus it introduces you to the universe and the characters. In a few words the pilot is a fast ""catch up"" for whoever hasn't seen a single episode of Star Trek but also a get to know with the characters for the rest. This is done by hints in discussion, some monologues, scenes of Klingon behavior and more. You are also being introduced to the Prime Directive, the main rule that all of Starfleet has to follow and the Klingon tradition of honor, bravery, glory and independence which is their guideline. After all that and when you have learned everything you need to know there are some action scenes here and there until the big finale that is the conclusion of the pilot and the beginning of the new arc.

Overall, I really enjoyed the discussions, the chemistry and the actions between the characters. I liked the fact that they show that Starfleet is consisted by many different races, cultures, behavior and opinions in union and always within a contradicting but ideal society. The simple but hard message that even if you disagree with someone or if you fail to do things your way or if ,in your passion,you have done some things that shame you, even then, you have to fight for what really matters when needed, unity above all else. Even if things have gone out of hand or if the result is bad for yourself you must stick to your ideals and stay kind, humble, noble, proud, brave and have the heart of an explorer. Seek out whatever you can like a child, face whatever is to face like a warrior and accept the consequences of your actions like a king.

Other than that, the effects were really good, the story seems that will go slower from now on, which is nice, and I think I'll be the ""explorer"" with these strange new Klingons! You can't know unless you try. Enjoy!",28 September 2017
"Keeping this simple , if you like trek or sci fi , watch season 1 and 2 , some filler episodes in both seasons which is to be expected but season 3 , what were they thinking , dull drawn out season that could of been covered in 3 episodes , shame really because it had a blank canvas and so much potential , what an absolute let down .",8 January 2021
"I really loved this series! Although I've grown up loving Star Trek, there's so much about it that needed modernising. In this new take on the old series, the visuals are beautiful, the science intriguing; the story is fluid, exciting and climactic; and the acting is inspiring, as is the character development of the heroine, played by Sonequa Martin-Green. Old star treks are amazing, but they tend to be based on one-sided, over simplified constructs of black-and-white social justice and ethics that are representative of American 1960s-1990s values. This series explores the Klingon empire (before it became an empire) and attempts to determine how the factionalism and drive for honour through violence would be represented in the individuals themselves, avoiding much of the archaic implied judgement that was present in so much of the old Star Treks.

The only thing that doesn't make sense to me is the over-emphasis on military bureaucratic hierarchy in the structure of the federation. Smithian bureaucratisation surely wouldn't have much of a future in organisational structure; its immediate failings were obvious and it seems to me that a federation built on exploration wouldn't be managed in such an out-of-date way. Nevertheless, it's a great series and well worth watching!",26 March 2018
"I don't think this show can be called Star Trek anymore. Season 1 and 2 were great but this season dropped off a cliff. It has turned into a Lifetime or Hallmark channel show. I am a big Star Trek fan and an even bigger Sci-fi enthusiast, but there is little of both in the new season. There's woke, and then there's this extreme version of it. They really dropped the ball on a legendary franchise filled with history of consistent intrigue and entertainment value. Wow.",24 December 2021
"But I can't so

To be honest i loved this show from the first season i was hooked. Those who cry and moan about it are foolish at best and maybe looking for up votes and such. I say go for it if that is what you are looking for on all your user names.

This IS not the original and never claimed to be so get over the fact.

You are on the internet and no one cares who you are and the goofy X amount of reviews that are given by the same person.",26 November 2021
"As a lifelong fan of the Star Trek universe, Discovery is the worst of all the series's.

Too much time spent on emotions and relationships. I served in the military, the lack of adherence to the chain of command is unrealistic.

I am very disappointed with the story lines and obvious holes in the plot lines where a simple solution is unnecessarily made complicated.

Please do better!",1 May 2022
"Relatively new to Star Trek. Really like the series, it's twists and turns keep me tuning in.

I Don't understand all the negative reviews, saying it's poorly written. Finding that I liked this series, I tried watching star trek next generation and found it unwatchably poorly written.

This to me feels like an upgrade, whilst continuing the general thrust of star trek which is the triumph of inclusiveness, solidarity, and knowledge in the face of ignorance and bigotry.

"As a lifelong Trekkie I welcome the Discovery Series. It's a much needed Breath of fresh air for a franchise that has become stale and stagnant in the TV department.Old overhauled concepts, corny Make-up/Costumes etc. Whoever doesn't like the different spin on things can always go back to watching the old stuff. I like the fact it's a woman of color as a main-lead character on a Sci-Fi show and the choice in Soniqua Martin-Green couldn't have been a better one. Everything is well re- imagined and shines light on pre Enterprise Star-Fleet scenarios in a very High Quality fashion, especially for a TV Series. Some people like changing things up every once in a while, others wanna be served Spaghetti all their life with no deviation. If you consider yourself part of the latter group...this show is not for you.",13 November 2017
"Star Trek is a sci-fi IP that has accrued a super passionate fan- base over the years -- similarly to the likes of Star Wars, Firefly, Farscape, etc. The lore-rich universes the writers create are something fans can grab onto and 'live' in their imaginations. As with any new release of material, much of this fan-base tends to want to flex their passion-muscles and nit-pick details apart to show everyone how knowledgeable they are about it -- to the overall detriment of the property.

Then there's another side that just can't stretch their tiny imaginations enough to understand why the writers and producers are using effects and story technologies available to them to present visuals that are up-to-date and interesting regardless of where it is in the story time-line. We have more modern-looking technology on our desks nowadays than the Original series or TNG showed us. Can you not just understand and enjoy? If you think you want to see old- film- tech because the time-line is before a previous series or movie, just go and re-watch the old shows and then tell us you want to see something like that in a new release -- you're nit-picking something that just isn't plausible.

So, it is *MY* opinion this is my favorite Trek so far. I love the new effects; the gritty, modern, film-quality visuals. The new Klingons are alien now and I love them! In fact the aliens in this series look way more alien than any trek before them -- instead of simply being humans with weird noses or ears or foreheads. The story is a continuing saga of not-so-perfect outcomes that plagued previous series where each episode was wrapped in a cute little bow of resolution in the last 5 minutes of each story. I'm not going to get caught up in what color the lead character is, or if she's got a male or female name base. I like the character - she's flawed and bold and torn. In fact all of the characters are flawed and that makes them more likable and realistic.

If you're a Trek fan that wants to show everyone how informed you are and point out every little mistake you can find and rate the title low because of it...well, I guess you're just not as excited as I am to see new Trek after 13 or 14 years -- and you're certainly doing your part to ensure this won't last long and there won't be any more. If you're the type that can't get past technology and visual reboots -- you're not going to like this, just move along and go re-watch the old series. However, if sci-fi (particularly Star Trek), a good story-line, and great movie-quality visuals are something that get you excited, try it out and enjoy it as an awesome new edition to the universe!

The only reason I'm knocking off a star is because I just can't understand the plot mechanic of pointing the blame finger at Michael for the problems that are now plaguing the Federation...how was it her *fault* again?

TL;DR -- The rating is for the story and presentation -- CBS All Access is a different animal altogether -- 0 stars for this abomination. I'm not opposed to paying for content, not at all. But if I'm paying for it...I don't expect ads. And if I'm paying for something -- forcing me to accept an ""agreement"" where you're going to sell my information to other marketers and partners should be illegal! Of course, it's my ""agreement"", no one is holding a gun to my head and I understand that. However, as soon as the season is over, I'm out! I'm only *in* because I love this show that much...",17 October 2017

"Fantastic cast. Fantastic art direction. Fantastic writing. Full heart and mind engagement. If you love Star Trek you will **love** Discovery. Its creators are totally attuned to everything that makes Star Trek great: feminism, complex characters and narratives, the subtleties of human emotion, imaginative science, theology, its own roots and tropes, and deep character development. Extra points for amazing Klingon development. Discovery for the win.",20 February 2019
"Series isn't really about ST, it's just more hollywood political BS...why do they have to shove that into every series they put out these days??? This is so tiring it's ridiculous the plot lines and writing are poor, the characters don't have any kind of evolution or charisma, there are endless dialogues that lead nowhere.... meanwhile 20% of the series is really about science fiction this is one of the worst sagas of ST, it should be cancelled!",29 April 2022
"Just imagine this were a common SciFi - what number in ratings will it be then? I am pretty sure it would be more then 8.8 - S. T. Discovery is a damn good SciFi Show - you should never miss this.

For me, as someone who never liked the originals - the new style and plot is fresh and good.

I think its the very right thing what the series needed to get modernized. It has strong characters, strong acting, strong effects and a suspenseful plot.

Don't listen to all those whiny reviews here - just watch and enjoy.",4 October 2017
"But it DOES hold true to the original timeline! Technological advancements are explained away quite nicely. Enough crossover to fill in a few story blanks. BUT THE FEEL is so much more intensive, a bit unpredictable, and so very much more creative. NBC has kept for yet a third season, MY ONLY HOPE is that they don't attempt to dilute the series down to make it more closed loop single episodes , humorless and boring.Further, IMDb gives it a 7.4. I'd have to shoot myself, (right after the show runners), if they ever even attempted to go back to old ways.. The review that pulled up quite obviously was pissed that he wasn't paid to write something nice so he's decided to vomit out large chunks of under cooked haggis to whine about it. That's what you get when your a 44 year old man unemployed and living in your mothers basement.",13 September 2019
"Idk how you could have a negative review. The gay and transgender stuff gets pushed obviously too hard which takes away from what Star Trek is about. It feels forced when it's just simply unity, no need to be so blatant. But nevertheless I'm on the edge of me seat constantly hitting next episode :) very cool show!",3 January 2022
"This is by far my favorite entry into the series. There's really no campy episodes like in past series. This series is intense so much going on all the time. If you're one of those wished for more space ship fights and phaser battles then this series is for you. The storylines are well developed and are engaging. I will even admit there is more than a few episodes that had me misty eyed. There some surprise guests and some of the storylines will crossover into other series storylines like all Star Trek series do. I binged watched the first four seasons in just a few days, it's that good! I can't wait for the final season.",1 September 2023
"This is far from what Star Trek started as. I feel like the Chris Pine modern films gave producers free creative licence to go ""above and beyond"" with their portrayal of the franchise. It's very ""un-Star Trek"" - there's a complete lack of authenticity. The characters are incredibly bland. The driving narrative is simply not that interesting. The costumes are not true to the original portrayals of certain species like the Klingons. The protagonist seemingly has a lot to say and do despite being an eventual outcast from Starfleet. It's all very confusing as a series and one that I simply cannot see through to the end.",5 May 2023
"Firstly, the aesthetics are are incredible. These are blockbuster movie quality effects. I am so glad that they spent the money on this. Secondly, character development. Casting a Black female in the lead is bold even in today's date. It is way past time for such and she delivers a superb performance. She is smart, forceful and a joy to watch. In past series', character development has been mainly confined to the starship crewmembers. This series takes the choice to develop characters of the antagonistic Klingons as well. This presents a more entriging scenario as plots develop. Staying true to General Order 1 through the series and mini-stories, really ties the current series to TNG. Let's face, the original did not. I also like the steps it takes to expose the ""general population"" to other-than-heterosexual characters and their relationships and struggles with each other. Other reviewers have complained, that this injects politics into their viewing and are uncomfortable with such. I argue that they must be living under rock. People love one another regardless of gender, etc. Love is not political. Get over it already. Even if I were to concede a political bend, Captain Kirk kissed Lt. Uhura in 1969, the first nationally televised ""inter-racial"" kiss. I air-quote inter-racial, because race is societal construct, not a scientific one. Now to state by biases. I am a long time Trekkie, having watched the original series in the 80's, TNG weekly in the 80-90's as they were released and the others as well. I am a Causian, Southern, staight, married male in his 40's. I love this show. I pay to watch it and after the first season, will purchase Season 2 on iTunes when available.",31 January 2019
"Season 4 of STD has got to be the worst ""Sci-Fi"" I have ever watched. It's almost a sin to even call this Sci-Fi and have it a part of the Star Trek brand. Nothing about it even relates to the history of Star Trek and the central themes and direction it has taken over the years. The entire season was all about ""feelings"" and ""emotions""!! FFS even the computer had feelings!!! It was sickening to watch and every episode got worse. Who wrote this BS? A bunch of fairies and unicorns and soft fluffy kittens?",25 March 2022
"A very interesting series that breathed new life into Star Trek. Finally, aliens do not look like humans. Do not believe the low ratings. They are put by those who are used to past low-budget series in which there was no money for high-quality make-up.

The Klingons themselves pushed me away at first. But as the storyline developed and the characters bloomed, I was fixated. No, it's not some utopian show...it's the story of how they get to that utopia so it's going to be a bit messy. But I'm a fan!",17 July 2018
"This is for the first season. Dark, dull, boring and as far from my beloved original series as you can get. Replacement actors for the originals like Mark Leonard are unconvincing, Jame Frain is the worst Sarek interpretation I have ever seen. They ruined the klingons, Vulcan and Andorians. The technology is so advanced that it belies my disbelief and having androids on the bridge is a slap in the face to the Next Generation. At the end they ruined the Enterprise and will LoL off when I suffer through the dreaded phony second season. This series should be de canonized just like the way, Solo, TFA, RS and TLJ should be within the Star Wars canon. The space battles are a laughable mess. I hate the darkness, where is the light of the Original Series and I would not be caught dead wearing those ugly Discovery uniforms.",6 February 2021

It still has all the hallmarks that make it innately Trek: humanity, a sense of hope and wide-eyed wonder, but with jeopardy, clever plots and no easy fixes. Sonequa Martin-Green leads from the front as 'Michael Burnham' with grace and strength, heading up a fantastic, talented cast, with great on-screen chemistry all round.

Season three was a real let down with the show no longer being a prequel. I really think they got this last season wrong and could have taken this show to a new level for any future ST projects.

I have watched TNG, Voyager, The Original series and Deep space Nine. They were indeed good shows. Star Trek Discovery is trash. The show apparently promotes Feminism which is ironic because the lead female character is resolutely unlikeable. Voyager had strong female leads. Janeway and Seven of Nine were strong characters. Michael Burnham is despicable. Skipped season 2 after 2 episodes. Binge watching old Star Trek is more sensible.",30 May 2020

Same here, they need to give a new feel to people growing up with this series to be likable, they are the 'Many' now, and the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few which are the old TOS & Generations fans... The era is over, get over it, adapt yourself, be assimilated, resistance is futile.",25 September 2017
"This show has finally ""grown the beard."" I love it, especially the character Saru. Discovery has always been a bold swing pushing the franchise to new tones and new frontiers, but so has every other Star Trek series. Seasons 3 and 4 start to embrace that premise, without the constraints of being a prequel series. Give it a chance and enjoy it on the same level as you might any other Star Trek show. Some episodes are inevitably better than others, but then again, TOS had ""Spock's Brain,"" TNG had ""Code of Honor,"" DS9's ""Move Along Home,"" etc. That's the fun of Star Trek, I think. Watch it holistically and enjoy what you like.",31 December 2021
"The lead actress (Sonequa Martin-Green) for me is the problem, I've never watched her in anything else and I must confess I wouldn't want to. The show is total rubbish in every direction and I'm surprised they keep making other seasons. Star Trek Enterprise was so much more deserving to continue as a series than what Star Trek has become with this version. Can our cousin in America please listen and axe the show.",25 May 2022
"I was really worried this might turn out like a dumbed down version of Star Trek. I was worried it was going to be as rough as some of the other series' intros. Luckily my fears were not realized, at least yet, as of episode 2.

Klingons look different? This probably bugs me the most, given it isn't like TOS or the other series' designs. That said, I liked it more than the Romulan adaptation the movies took.

To people complaining about holo tech... I get it. But if we're really this far into the future, isn't it realistic that this is possible? Star Trek was good at predicting the future, but not perfect. All those scenes in DS9 when they had to go talk to each other in person, or in TNG when you needed multiple PADDs for everything... Initially while the holo work was irksome, I like it when I reflected on how close we are to holo tech in this century and project out.

I haven't made up my mind on the main character, but overall enjoyed her performance (and the rest of the crew's)!

I sincerely hope that the rest of the series is the great mix of old and new Trek I saw in these two episodes. Hopefully they keep it full of action but still sharp and intelligent.",25 September 2017
"Despite costing millions, I really don't know who this show is made for. I can't imagine it has many viewers, since it's made for a streaming service few watch. Every Trekkie you run into, in the wild, is not just indifferent, but feels seething hatred and abject disgust for it. I've yet to meet a viewer who's opinion wasn't extremely negative. It's reputation is terrible online and offline.

The show seems to wear this reputation proudly, as if it's critics are the enemy; they are just too stupid to appreciate it, and the more they criticize the more determined DSC is to continue, to spite the masses. Long time Star Trek fans in particular seem to be the enemy, since they are so disappointed, as if they owe deference. Perhaps someone in charge sees them as extremists simply for caring about their hobby, and vandalizing the franchise is 'just deserts' for fans not liking their show.

Average viewers want to enjoy a thoughtful addition to the Star Trek legend, which does not step on the toes of the acclaimed franchise's history, but adds to it. It's easy enough, if you can write at least as well as Star Trek, Stargate SG-1, Babylon 5 or Farscape did, or a modern show like The Expanse or The Mandalorian. People don't want to be condescended or insulted for their personal interests, which includes caring about things like consistent history, or good writing. For many millions, research into the world of Star Trek, was half of the fun.

DSC's characters often act like they are in a sitcom or soap opera, full of forced feelings, cartoon blunders, misjudged humor and misunderstandings. DSC's science is infantile, below high school level. It's closer to fantasy than science fiction. It's a step down where most franchises have taken a step up. Floating rocks and other unimaginative fantasy gimmicks are everywhere. No previous show needed to exaggerate the natural beauty of the universe. Planets and other celestial objects are all in visual sight of each other like a cartoon playbook. The behavior of the crew is infantile given the profession they are in. They treat life in a NASA-like organization like it's personal time to behave however they want. The music is inappropriate, and overwhelms every scene.

The main character has been retroactively made the most important human being in history. She taught the classic world famous character 'Spock'. She started and ended a massive war. She saved the universe. She put the Federation back together. What next? Perhaps she went back in time and started life on Earth? Authored every scientific discovery? Is this seriously the only way writers can think to make their writing 'important', by saying everyone secretly owed their existence to this character, or is this done to deliberately antagonize people?

Given how the last three years has revealed the extent of hysteria in Hollywood, one cannot help wonder if this is all intentional. In this George Orwell-like dystopia, 'science' and 'truth' are oppressive, just getting in the writers way; they should be free to write whatever they want. Is this why pointing out how bad a show is, is treated like a personal attack?

Star Trek: Discovery demolished a long legacy that once had tens of millions of fans, and inspired astronauts and engineers. It was a source of joy each week for millions.",24 November 2021
"forget the bad user reviews not sure what they expecting but i can tell you this program is just so good,if i could give more than 10 stars i would. its new and its fresh,highly recommended even for non trek fans. the bad reviews? they know nothing of star trek,this is still star trek at its core with new and fresh ideas,still works for me and I'm a massive trek fan.",18 October 2017
"The naysayers are wrong about this excellent series. Right from the off one can tell it has been shot with a loving eye for hues and detail. The characters are well rounded and full. The series carries on the tradition of the original and enhances upon the concept of what makes them both great, diversity and tolerance. The effects are wonderful with design and Foley being used to the full. Cudo's to all.",7 June 2019
"As someone unfamiliar with previous the previous Star Trek series, I found the introductory episodes of Discovery to be decent enough to pique my interest in the rest of the series. I know a lot of users are upset by the change in direction of the franchise, but if you enjoyed the tone of the latest Star Trek movies then I believe you'll like this one. I won't attempt to critique the portrayal of the universe since I'm not familiar enough to judge, but you'll know after the first episode whether or not this show is for you.",27 September 2017
"The main issue of all these 1 star reviews revolves around 2 things. The first being that it doesn't look exactly like the old ones and uses a different story telling format in season 1 and 2. Season 3 is more like previous Ster Treks. I think they are silly for this line of reasoning but I can at least understand the logic.

The second reason is far more sinister. A cursory read through of most of these 1 star reviews will show you that they don't like: emotions, are antagonist against females being leaders or questioning themselves, definitely don't like seeing actual relationships being developed (good and bad), there is LGBTQ representation, and that there is crying. All hallmarks of toxic masculinity and the nasty underside of nerd culture.

One would think that by watching a show for decades they would have picked up on some of the shows themes of love, kindness, and our shared humanity but I suppose some are just too dense.

Now does the show have some issues? Yes it does. Was there a lot of crying in season 3? yes there was. However, in season 3 the crew of the Discovery have gone through some serious stuff and tears are warranted. It goes back to that whole shared humanity theme that many of these haters seem to have forgotten is a core value of the franchise.

If you are thinking about watching the show do it. Enjoy the ride. The characters a flawed both intentionally and unintentionally but that will make you love them all the more.",24 February 2021
"This show is an insult not only to the Star Trek fans out there, but to the intelligence of the audience in general.

The plot holes are so wide, you could fit the entire Star Trek fleet in it.

The show is filled with so much drama, you start to wonder if its actually meant to be a comedy.

The main story line is so amateurishly written, you could probably do better by just banging your head into the keyboard.

On a serious note, the show really fails to capture what made Stark Trek great.

Apart from that, the horrible plot and overly whiny and utterly stupid characters make it absolutely unwatchable despite it's cool looking visuals.",4 December 2021
I have thoroughly enjoyed the series so far and highly recommend it. Completed season 1 and watched S2E1....I am hooked. I have watched all of the Star Trek series over the years and I am pleased to have this new show.,20 January 2019
I kept trying to love this. The effects the landscape the world the moral universe have all had their moments but now it's a waste of time and horrific waste of money. Dripping in vacuous soliloquies and anodyne soundtracking. No room for pace and sci fi. Not enough dynamism and evil characters. Had narrative moments in series 1 and 2. I liked the episodes with the tardigrade. Left me grimacing as if I'd watched a doc about plastic in the ocean. I've not read a review that seems pleased of able to articulate any of its values. The expanse nails this to the wall . Oh well. I feel for the actors a touch.,26 November 2022
"I'm surprised by all the negative reviews. The old Trek formula of the main protagonist being a heroic, idealistic captain has become old and tired. The shift of focus to someone who is not at the top of the chain of command is a welcome change, as is making that protagonist a disgraced former officer getting a second chance. Making the captain of this vessel a flawed, dark character who may be psychotic and a little bit insane is also a stroke of genius.

I get that this is far from Roddenberry's vision of the future. But come on, that was getting boring. I've been watching Trek since the original series, and enjoyed all of them except for Enterprise. Having said that, I'm not a Trek nerd so, for me at least, the lack of continuity is not an issue. I couldn't care less if the technology seems better than Kirk's Enterprise. The new Klingons, however, are very strange and take a while to get used to.

I actually found the writing to be very good, especially some of the dialogue.

Sadly, I doubt this show will continue beyond a season. It would be nice to see them develop the characters of more of the bridge crew.

I also don't understand the issues people have with the casting. I've even seen someone describing the presence of gay/lesbians and people of different ethnicities (i.e. non-white) as a ""menagerie""! Come on folks, this is the future.",1 November 2017
"This show is AWESOME, and I'll tell you why in few simple lines.

1.Great Acting. This is (at least in my opinion) first American TV show with the absolutely perfect cast. No weak actors and you can truly see they are the one with their roles. That said, I don't mean US actors are bad. It is just hard for any nation to get a great cast all in all. (Except Great Britain) They are natural, I guess.

2.Great Cinematography. When I watched the trailer for the show, I wasn't sure if it was a movie or a TV show. Camera angles are very effective, lightning is immaculate, CGI on par with the top Hollywood blockbusters (almost;)!

3.Character development. You know, one of the worst things in any movie or TV show, is bad character development, and actors doing senseless stuff, or thing OUT of their character. Example: Klingon dialogue and story development show true potential and dept in the narration.

Well, what do you want me to say more than that in many ways, I understand and sympathize with the Klingons. That's how much the characters are developed.

4. For those of you pointing out that it has nothing to do with the original Star Trek universe, I hear you, and I understand your point of view. But may I point out that everything in this world is subject to change, including this TV show. Would I like to see men in miniskirts, retro hair holders, storyline developing around the subject of black holes or lines like: Sir, we can speed up to 9.8 (something) but it can be very, very dangerous. And my answer is HELL NO! That is so 20 century, and depth in story lines and the more complex plot is needed. Everyone knows nowadays what the black holes are, and everyone can read the speed limiter and realize it is dangerous to go faster than XX. But we ask for MORE detail, more explanation. By my opinion, most of you who stand behind older Star Trek show, hold onto past. When was the last time you watched ""Next generation""? Please, just get the first episode of the show, and honestly, tell me that you can watch it to the end?

So far, to my knowledge and opinion there are only a couple shows with quality as Star Trek ""Discovery"", and if you like those, I wholeheartedly suggest that you give a chance to this one too. And I watched many many TV shows.

Those shows are: Stranger Things Game of Thrones Sherlock Holmes (New one with Benedict, although the old one is great too) and to a certain extent American Horror Story

I am giving it 8/10, instead of 9 only because I sympathize with the people, who do not appreciate such a huge change in storyline, costumes, and everything else for that matter.",4 November 2017
I think it's great please keep making more. This new approach is refreshing. As a true Star Trek fan I wish this series great success.,20 January 2019
"Watch for yourself, I love the show and glad it is back for another season.",14 December 2018
"The is the Womens StarTrek, this is the LGBTQ Star Trek ! In the 23rd century (only 10 years before the James T. Kirk Star trek) there will be only women bosses and LGBTQ characters. Women have gotten what they wanted: to cast their male counterparts aside and take control of everything ! Including 120Lb women overpowering 230Lb men in hand to hand combat ! We see these gender reverse type scenarios all over the place these days. Men play minor roles in Star Trek Distovery. Some furure huh ?! Ok Libs we get it !

This show is ridiculously dumb !! I coudn't watch it with all the Cat Fights and the Lady Ninja's sword fights !! Nothing worse than dumb Sci Fi !!!!",1 May 2022
"Best Star Trek since the Dominion War of DS9! Definitely worth the CBSAA subscription. Things start out slow in the first two episodes, but the real pilot is episode three with the intro to the USS Discovery and Captain Lorca, played by Jason Issacs. He is by far one of the best captains I've seen in the Star Trek franchise yet!",7 October 2017
"I've read a lot of the reviews and feel very similar to their assessment. Seasons 1/2, great sci-fi, entertaining characters, etc. But seasons 3/4, I'm struggling with them. I'm perfectly fine with an LGBTQ element, but good lord does every episode need to be an introspective discovery?! So much crying, and needing, and hugging. Enough with the kumbaya moments!....It's literally every episode! Can we get back to discovery? Good guys/bad guys? Subtle messaging tied into the occasional show. Maybe add some laughter.

Like others, I gave 5 stars. It's fantastic imagery, but a very tiring story....5 for hoping it gets better.

....extra thought here; Season 4, the federation president is probably my favorite character on the show and I've seen her in 1 episode....she seems to resemble more of the style of Star Trek leadership I'm used to seeing.",14 January 2022
"I enjoy it, good story, sometimes very surprising.",27 November 2019
This star trek borrows heavily from the new movies while paying homage to the original series. Casting is Excellent. Story line was fantastic! This is the star trek I expect to watch now. Older star trek series just wont work anymore. This is the only option that younger audiences want to see!,26 September 2017
"I consider myself a fan of a older Star Trek series, especially TNG and Voyager. I do not understand why there are so many negative comments for Discovery series after just three pretty good episodes... Consider that TNG takes one whole season for actors to sit up in to their characters role...Please, Give Discovery a chance, because in my opinion, there is a lot of potential for story development. I must admit that I liked first three episodes. I like tension between characters, I like Michael Burnhams mutiny curse, I like camera, effects... Don't you think that it would be odd that the new Star Trek has the same lovely but a little naive approach to the complexity of space traveling and new life exploring? So, step aside, Discovery haters, don't miss a fact that Discovery is the best new Sci-fi show at the moment.",3 October 2017
"I love this show for one reason

it challenges your mind. difficult decisions and having to question rules i what makes star trek great.

Kirk, Picard both had to fight the system and make difficult decisions.

leadership. and boy does this show have challenges.

Love it. and all the rest of the star trek stuff that goes along with it.",15 October 2017
"A pretty good season 1 with some moments in 2 and less so in 3....but season 4...wow, what a mess.

All the characters overacting and talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about their feelings.",25 July 2022
"They did a great job of modernizing Star Trek, some fan may be upset that it isn't sticking to the original formula of what Star Trek was but I disagree. STD is great, the plot keeps you coming back each week to see what happens, the storyline is amazing & I hope they keep this going!",16 February 2019
"I love all things star trek so I almost needed to watch this series, I couldn't not watch it. I like the sci-fi aspects, especially after the first 2 season. The visuals are good but... for my taste there was/is way too much crying, weeping, hugging, pained looks, emotional drama etc, just way TMI about the characters personal lives, feelings, anxieties and personal issues. There were a bunch of times I thought, ""oh brother, here we go again. I gladly would stop episodes, skip seems that I knew would be sappy, drippy and oh so packed with such deep, deep feelings, and caring, and love and blah, blah blah.",29 March 2022
Good start. I think one thing we will see with this Trek that we haven't seen as much of in the past is special effects and space scenes. The cost of CGI has gone way down since the days of TNG- ENT. The acting was good but I look forward to seeing some past characters make an appearance due to some time traveling or something. Overall I was happy with the show and look forward to seeing more.,25 September 2017
"Beginning with episode three, the series becomes quiet good. There are plenty of surprises and fresh ideas in this star trek universe. I recommend skipping the first two episodes.",20 January 2018
"I have no idea why so many people are having negative reactions to this series and why 'too many feelings' constitutes a bad thing. I'm an old school trekkie but I find it inspiring that the show is evolving and embracing the human side of space travel and science fiction. This for me is the signal of a civilisation advancing and a science fiction show too, where inner and outer dimensions begin to blur. Many great science fictions pieces (Solaris, Interstellar) have delved into this area and I feel in time so will our own understandings. I loved all the characters including Burnham's as well as the increasingly multi-dimensional nature of Discovery's adventures. I enjoyed the overall narrative as well as the intensity of the later episodes. For me, Rodenberry set out to explore our humanity through a sci fi genre and getting deeper into that must ultimately be an adventure of the heart as well as the Enterprise.",8 January 2021
"I don't consider myself as a Trekkie, even though I've seen all episodes of all the Star Trek series at least three times, at a time when you had to buy the VHS to see them all...OK, I am a Trekkie.

...So when the first reboot came out in 2009, my first query was : ""why is there no new Star Trek series ???"".

And so 8 years latter we get one : ""Discovery"" !

Expectations were high, and as far as I am concerned, they delivered !

Amazing special effects, great cast, but most of all, they brought us something fresh, something new.

But then I saw that the IMDb rating is at 6,9 !!!???

...and now I understand : something new is not what people wanted. What they wanted was something old packaged as something new, as they did with ""The Force Awaken"".

I, for one, am way more interested in a new movie than a remake... but that's me.

If that's you as well, then this NEW Sci-Fi series is for you !!!

Live long and...well, you know !",25 September 2017
"Production values are high so one star. The scripts, characters, actors and direction are abysmal and have nothing to do with Star Trek. The future vision depicted in this Star Trek Discovery universe is one where real men are irrational castrated shadow minorities. There is literally no males in this show that any young person could aspire to emulate. This show is such BS.",1 April 2022
Maybe not the classic Star Trek others would expect... but honestly a good show that's well put together. And deserves at least 8/10,28 October 2020
It's not the worst not not the best. Season 4 is quite borring. Star Trek should be about exploring new words/species and all but instead there is only one thing they are dealing with the whole time and by the time anything happens you need to go through ton of B roll and listen how is anybody feeling about that. Quite boring and slow paced to be honest. There is this weird wibe in it about some forced equilibruim fake agenda and about pretending how good we all must be to each other. Im fast forwarding last episodes to just see the end...,23 March 2022
"I never was a big Trek Fan. Maybe it's not typical Star Trek. You can criticize that. But it's so gripping and so well written. It's starting a bit slow, but it's getting better and better. I think it's only rated 7,4, because all the Trekkies keep whining about some changes and giving it 1 Point. Normal people just appreciate the show and give it 8-10 points. When this would be the start of a new franchise, the rating would be about 8,8. Haters gonna hate. Open minded Science-Fiction Fans must watch this!",30 August 2018
"I think this show is great. I know a lot of hard core Trekies don't like it, but I think this show has a LOT of potential. The acting and the characters are wonderful. If they do anything to Lt. Stamets I will come after the writers. I admit it took a little while to get going, but once I got to the time loop episode, I really fell in love with it. I think it can go a lot of different directions, but I love that they've introduced so many new aspects into this series. I think its worth it to give the this show a chance. Keep up the good work. I really like where this is going.",27 December 2017
"I had been a fan of Star Trek as long as I can remember. I grew up watching TNG and watched all subsequent series. I was super excited for the new series but also a little apprehensive - would it hold up to my current tv tastes? Safe to say Discovery did not disappoint! It is by far my favorite Trek series of all time. The characters are so rich and complex and the writing is superb. Stamets and Tilly are the best characters, I've never related more to any Trek character quite like I do with these two. Where I always found watching Trek to be an enjoyable experience, Discovery also challenges me with deep meaning and rich character reflection indicitive of strong writing and superb acting. Everything about this show is top notch and totally worth the $5 a month. I've watched it through 3 times and cant wait for more!",27 July 2018
"I really enjoyed this show, will tune in for Season 2, and am slightly surprised by the amount of sheer negativity here. I thought the plot was interesting, with twists that I did not see coming, and was a good imagining of the time before the original series. This is not Trek, NG, DS9, Voyager, etc., etc.. It's its own show, let it develop & grow, you might be surprised. Or don't; I don't really care, but I'm going to enjoy this show.",8 March 2018
"First season was really ok, second just ok, third 5+/10 and fourth is just a garbage. This show now is just a symphony of political correctness and the ubiquitous hero cry.",12 December 2021
"I don't understand the sad critics to this series, but I am sure that you never can satisfy everyone, this series is a so happy return to the star trek universe, is not perfect but is absolutely worthy",21 August 2019
Series started great then became a joke. Painful even. Don't bother watching. You won't find Star Trek here. Hopefully Picard won't make the same mistakes. Plenty of real Sci-fi series to watch out there. Roddenberry would be ashamed!!!,28 February 2022
"Compelling characters, plenty of plot twists, thought-provoking ideas- anyone who says it brings up too many social issues has not been paying attention to the rest of the franchise and doesn't know what sci-fi is all about in the first place. Can't wait for Season 3!",17 June 2019
"Why The New 'Star Trek' Series Is The Best One Ever Made?!

Okay, I'll make it short:

Fantastic Cast
Fantastic New Designs (Klingons, Andorians & Tellarites)
Good Story (Federation-Klingon conflict, Mirror Universe)


I have been a Trek fan since childhood, and a fan of Klingons in particular, both the original and current style. Okay, the current style JJA or Fuller/Kurtzman is very amazing - we love it!

So far, Star Trek: Discovery is quite good. It's gorgeously executed, thrilling to watch, and full of heart. Star Trek Series is back now and better than ever! Some will disagree but after thirteen episodes, I've seen enough to make me think this could take the franchise into places Gene Roddenberry never went before.

Thanks J.J Abrams, Alex Kurtzman & Bryan Fuller",1 February 2018
"I've been watching Star Trek since a kid, running home from school to catch the latest Voyager episode. And have watched every series, so I've got a good understand of the universe.

So if you're looking for you next PG rated Star Trek series this probably isn't for you. I'll admit the first series was terrible, it dragged and I found it hard to watch. With that said my original rating was a 4/10. I felt that the show didn't portray the fundamental values of what Star Trek is all about. While it was good trying to highlight real world issues and the dark reality of war, it kinda put the promotion humanities drive for self improve and exploration on the back burner. Something I fou d rather intresting as most other Star Trek series only brought in a war when ratings where dropping.

However, since the release of season 2 I have found it far more enjoyable. The stories a lot more entertaining, their focusing on other characters more and developing back stories to make them more relatable. And keep an eye out for Jett Reno, the breath of fresh air Star Trek has been needing in a long time!!

And all I ask is you give it time, the first series is always a bad one. And when you've lost attention, and you're checking you phone, check out a few Star Trek forums, Discovery has everyone fast tracked for the Eugenics War! Oops spoiler there.",20 February 2019
"I grew up with tng, ds9 and voy, never watched ent or tos. I never bothered watching the new movies.

My expectations for this series were low because of all the hate people gave it. Still I started to watch it on Netflix. And I can say that this is the best scifi series i have seen since BSG.

I enjoyed the plot, the actors and the new look on trek. The new klingons look great. It is darker (which i love) and i loved the story lines.

I can recommend this to anyone who likes good scifi and it not a star trek purist.",18 February 2018
The absolute Worst of all the series. I've watched and enjoyed every single one until this one! What were they thinking ? So sick of the industry being politically correct rather than hiring the right actors for some of these rolls . I Can barely get through any episode 🙄 I'd rather watch paint dry. We no longer watch it and do not recommend it. It's just dumb.,18 March 2022
"I watched the whole Star Trek series and i consider myself a fan. I am not a US kinda fan though. I don't live for Star Trek and i don't dress in uniforms. These so called hardcore US fans are against a great show because they have to pay for it and because there are slight changes in the story. Why can't you just enjoy a good SiFi show? Not unlike SG:Universe, they will get the show canceled then cry its gone.

I love the show, please don't take it away from me! Don't watch it if you don't like it.",4 October 2017
Storylines are boring as hell. Characters are dull af. And story is set too far in the future to make any interesting connections with other Star Trek series like the first season did. F this show.,26 February 2022
"Watching Sonequa Martin-Green trying to act is like watching someone with indigestion trying to take a dump. how did someone this unqualified get a part in this show. it's a pleasure watching everyone else but her. what's with the constant wide eyes and head tilting is? the staring into space. the complete lack of conviction when talking about anything technical. this is the third season that she has worked with some truly talented actors, can she really not learn something from them. i hope her character gets killed off. i rather have all the cast share the camera equally. would love to see more of Oyin Oledejo,Ronnie Rowe and Emily Coutts. god, Sonequa Martin-Green is unwatchable. i hate listening to her too. it would have been better if she had just died in that suit.",5 December 2020
Wife and I absolutely love this show. No it's not your daddy's trek (and I say that as someone who watched and loved TOS at the age of 7 on up). It's Star Trek for a new generation of viewers and love what I'm seeing so far. I'm not one who gets hung up on canon and whatnot. Just give me good characters and a good story.,15 October 2017
"I love this series and I love the characters and seeing the new life forms and how the worlds have changed in way into the future. I especially love seeing lots of people who look like me and not the single supporting Black character that we usually see! The multi racial and multi species cast of characters makes it just superb! Also I loved watching Michelle Yeoh and all the cantankerousness and aggressive hostility her character brings to the series.

So I don't know why anyone would dislike this series but 2021 has shown me that some people in the world just can't stand anyone who doesn't look, think, act or worship like they do and definitely cannot stand seeing a show where people who look like them are not the main characters and that includes the aliens! Which is clearly not what the Federation is about and why in the future would a specific race of humans be so prevalent in leadership roles when the universe is so full of many many different kinds of beings?

I have seen every single episodes of all the Star Treks (except the originals I find them hard to get into) and have watched them all through many times but this series is my favorite and I just was drawn in by these characters. What is different about this series is that one can never be certain a character is going to live but also we get surprised and see people we though didn't make it, survive. I liked how it made it less predictable and that built suspense but by the end of the third year I was hopeful about the future which is what makes Star Trek so endearing and enduring! That we see people United by a common purpose and belief system they work towards and EVERYONE is valued and has a moment to shine. I feel it when Michael Burnham says ""Let's show them who we are."" THIS is Starfleet and I will watch this series for the rest of my life like the others!!",13 January 2021
Not sure why people are saying it is so bad I really enjoyed it.,17 April 2020
"I am most of the way through season 3 as I write this; and in my opinion, the three seasons need subtitles (not language-translation subtitles, but subordinate descriptions of the each series).

"Great acting, great writing, great production value and quality television that is in the spirit of the original and boldly goes where it could not go before. A solid 7/10, but I'm putting 10 stars to counteract the hate. Please do not pay attention to the angry nerds peppering the show with one-star reviews. Watching one episode would prove to anyone that even if it isnt their cup of tea, it's not a 1/10. That kind of hyperbolic nonsense is just backlash that would follow literally any attempt to revisit a universe thats been reinterpreted this many times.",31 July 2018
"This series is probably written and produced by 15-20 year old kids, only the first and partly the second series were quite good, then it's a total boring fall full of nonsense and activism, we're all crying and can't do anything...",22 August 2022
"Those throwing shade at the new Star Trek probably never understood the old Star Trek.

It wasn't about the length of the mini skirts or having a womanizing captain...it was about telling original sci-fi stories.

Yes, this new series is dark (due to its naturally lit sets, obviously). Yes, it's serialized rather than episodic. Yes, it follows an outcast rather than a captain and his sidekick. And, yes, the Klingons look different, yet again (hey, they have in every incarnation of the series, go figure).

But these are all things that make it different from the rest. And, sure, they could have gone with the standard template of the bright, optimistic, artificially lit Star Trek that has endured for so long. But it would have crashed and burned like so many of Kirk's Enterprises.

Doing the same old, same old, would have utterly failed. You know how I know this? Because they made Enterprise. It was the most derivative of all the Star Trek series, trying to be like TNG, but also TOS, but also tipping its hat to VGR, while doing more serialized segments like DS9. It wanted to be everything all at once and so ultimately became a bland, derivative, piece of space junk.

So anything that was going to be like the Star Trek of the past was doomed to failure. It needed a fresh perspective by storytellers who weren't afraid to push the limits of the franchise and boldly go where no Star Trek series has gone before.

Star Trek Discovery is THAT series.

So hate on it all you want. It has probably the strongest pilot of any of the Treks--including STNG. Its cast is superb. It's touching on very interesting sci-fi concepts. Its visual effects are cinematic quality. Its production design is equal to that of a major Hollywood blockbuster. Yet it still contains stories about people at its core.

Star Trek Discovery is hitting all the right notes. It is doing what Enterprise so utterly failed to do--be its own thing. And be original. Be innovative. And still be Star Trek. Feel free to disagree, but history will prove you wrong. Just as it did with all the naysayers who complained about STNG, DS9, and VGR because they weren't their predecessors.",5 October 2017
Season after season this show creates new storylines that blow my mind & keep me on the edge of my seat wanting more & more. The writers & the actors bring their A game in every episode. This is where all of Hollywood's best is at; writers & actors alike. I hope this show continues going strong for many more seasons.,27 April 2022
"I enjoy everything in this show, the acting, the special effects, the characters, the storyline! I feel like each episode is the quality of a movie, and it seems to be really underrated on here. I think maybe it's because I am relatively new to Star Trek and lots of people leaving the bad reviews seem to point out how different it is from previous Star Trek entries. I'm going to go back and watch previous Treks and maybe then I'll understand why this doesn't get the reviews I think it deserves!",25 October 2020
Trekkies are like kids who stuck in the time-loop of seventies and demanding their favorite dish being served the same manner over next 30 years. Most of the bad reviews come from people who say there is a lack of logic in the series - and these so-called reviews are based on first 2 episodes which are not standalone stories. Pure logic.,2 October 2017
"The title summarizes the show up to episode 9. Its basically a show aimed at a dumber audience. They replace science with action which is why so many TNG fans are upset. It is no longer a show that centers on scientific intrigue or scientific inquiry. You note many positive reviews don't even touch this topic which proves the point. The new positive viewers think that its a ""old"" vs ""young"" difference which just proves how small their brain really is. This is actually a comparison of cranial people (ones who like to think) vs. those who want mindless action and explosions. Case and point, I loved TNG back when I was 12 while most of my friend called me a nerd (later they call me boss and now I just laugh since I retired in my late 30s while they still struggle with bills).

Anyway, if you like the Transformers or Michael Bay movies you will like this. If you are a thinker, this will bore you to death.",14 November 2017
"If you have an open mind. You will enjoy this as I do.

I thoroughly enjoyed the 1st season. I have watched Star Trek since the 70s and I feel that it has endeavoured to deliver thought provoking science fiction and that is what this does.

Embrace the future because this is not just for the hard core fans but is freshly packaged to include the younger generations.",3 February 2019
"A show that without the words ""Start Trek"" on its title would had been probably cancelled before the end of its first season. Bad writing, indifferent characters, shallow stories and the worse lead in the history of the franchise.

No sense, just style, lots of confused style and lots of unnecessary special effects.

The writing is abysmal, not to mention that they basically write like if the plot takes place in the 21th century and not in the advanced society of the Star Trek universe. There is no character development and the the shallow stories focus almost entirely on the uninteresting, very annoying and emotionally unstable lead.

As for the rest of the crew? they looks more like high school teenagers who play ""space opera"" RPG games than professionals who are supposed to navigate spaceships.

Such a disaster, such a shame for the franchise...",9 January 2021
"Being a syfi fan, I love this. Yes I'm not a conisur of the original start trek only ever watched Star Trek next generation and the new films, which I liked. You can't listen to all the negative reviews. Give it a go and if you don't compare it to other Star Trek programs and see it as a new show, it's good. I loved dark matter which was a good show which was cancelled because of negativeity hope this doesn't go the same way.",22 January 2019
"Sure it's a new perspective. And a bit political/semi sjw at times. But they are weaving the theme of Star Trek into it. Can a person make a stand, alone, for what they believe in? Just like TOS (Can mankind progress past race and predjudice?), then TNG (We can, but how do we stand in judgement for all we have done?), Voyager (Can we keep our principles when no one is around to see what we do?) and DS9 (Can we keep our principles in the face of terrorism and war?). So it makes sense that the show is focused on one person in particular, to prove the point. Michael lives up to that and is a great character.

Quite a bit is being adjusted/retconned, but nothing like what the youtubers claim. Kirk used N64 cartridges and Picard used iPads. The show is being forward thinking again. Sure section 31 is in, but it has to be and they have all the cool toys as usual. Looking forward to its show, if the rumors are true. Glad this one has a third season. As long as they don't time travel every episode like Enterprise we should be fine. But it shouldn't be expected that people are going to flock to CBS app just for this show or any others...CBS. Put it on Netflix or Hulu and the ratings will soar.",8 March 2019
"It's a great show.

Watch, enjoy and appreciate the franchise that is evolving from the 1960s.

Alot of the low comments are from fans who were expecting the identical story lines and plots TNG or Voyager with just different characters.

Always remember the original series and Enterprise were both cancelled in their prime due to low reviews, the reflecting years later, those same fans hate the network for cancelling these brilliant shows as they finally approcoated and liked the story lines.

Discovery is well told, well made and beautifully portrayed by its actors.",19 June 2021
"Every episode seems to be about the majority of the cast crying, semi-whispering dialogue about ""this is the right thing to do, we are the federation, I love you mama"", followed by more crying and whispering. And in the background violin strings build up to force-feed you the emotions. It's tiring and lazy. I'm also getting fed up with the fact that there's a lack of sci-fi backed science. It's morphing interiors, personal transporters, et cetera, but nothing seems to be grounded in science that is believable within the context of Star Trek. There's a huge focus on alien politics and not much on science. Why did they remove something that is so core to Star Trek's intellectual property?

Also, Sonequa is a very beautiful woman - a stunning presence on screen.",2 December 2020
"This is Star Trek! Do not believe all the triggered reviews. They are clearly from the Mirror Universe. 😄 I have been watching Star Trek since I was knee-high to a Tribble in the early 1970s, and this is some of the best storytelling I've witnessed in the Trek universe. In fact, as we're entering the 3rd episode of the 3rd season, Star Trek Discovery is my favorite of all Treks. I'm a huge TOS, but Disco is sublime. Led by an all-star cast, with exceptional writers, costumers, and special effects, this is the Trek we need right now. Thank you, Gene Roddenberry, for creating a universe with the ability to meet us where we are in our own history. Now stop reading and go watch for yourself.",24 October 2020
"Not at Generations level, but very enjoyable nonetheless!",3 July 2019
I can only conclude that so many of the low score reviews are from trekkers who dislike its divergence from the style TNG etcetera. Discovery is easy access to new to trek viewers and certainly has far less bad episodes than the previous series. 3 very different series and for me a real winner,12 November 2020
"Star Trek as a franchise is dying and no one can deny that. Show a 15 year old OS and there's no way they're gonna get invested. Show them Discovery? Your chances are so much higher. Action, mystery, a continuing plot, engaging characters, improved CGI. As a life long Trek fan I'm delighted to find my friends are now giving the older series' a chance after loving DISCO so much. This show is so important in helping keep the Trek legacy alive and I feel pity for anyone that can't enjoy this show for what it is. It's meant to change things. Redesigns, new timelines, new characters, more diversity- I'm sorry you hate these NORMAL Star Trek things so much. Yes there's inconsistencies and rewrites and a lotta pseudoscience but hasn't Trek always been that way? Get over yourselves and just enjoy this exciting new frontier!!",28 January 2019
"I'm aware of the insane organized review bombing going on for this show, but don't be fooled: this show is incredible! The first three episodes have been one epic ride, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the season so much! Visually, there is no show like this. The CGI and overall sci-fi concepts are amazing. Sure, it may not fit in the established time frame, but I for one am glad that they took the liberty to re-imagine certain technology. In the end, the most basic TOS-concepts are all still there.

The main character (Michael Burnham) goes through an amazing personal story arc, and I'm really interested to see how they follow this up. I've been a Trekkie since 1994, and this series certainly is a very different animal then Trek from those days... but in a good way! And the same goes here: in the end, the fundamentals of Trek are present at large in Discovery as well! You'll love it! Give it a chance!",8 October 2017
Michael knows best. Michael Always do the right thing. Michael is always diplomatic and gathered. The show is Always emotionally sticky and everyone is a saint (except the bad guys). Moral cakes all the time. Still watching since I love star trek But this spin is kinda disgusting.,27 June 2022
"I really wasn't expecting to like this show, and in fact, I didn't even intend to watch it. I am a huge fan of STNG and hated Star Trek: Enterprise. I didn't understand why the show's creators decided to go backwards in Federation history rather than forwards and would spend the whole show trying to figure how this particular event, character or piece of tech fitted into my understanding of the show's time-line and continuity. Eventually this became so distracting I gave up and stopped watching.

The only reason I started watching this series is because a friend who loves ST and who's opinion I value suggested I give it a try and, so I did. It isn't Star Trek. By that I mean the show's atmosphere, the character's dialogue and behaviour do not automatically take my imagination to the Star Trek universe and that is a good thing. Why? Because if they did, I would have the same problems with Discovery as I did with Enterprise.

So, why did I give the show an '8'? I gave it an '8' because once I sat down in front of it and did not expect it to conform to my Star Trek expectations I found it was a really good sci-fi show. I enjoy its story telling, the characters are interesting, and I think the acting and special effects are pretty consistently good. I even find the show mildly compelling to watch, catching myself occasionally thinking, 'when will the next episode be available?' and wondering what will happen. Do watch this show and give it a try. Just DO NOT expect it to conform to your favourite incarnation of Star Trek, because if you do you will, probably, be disappointed.",13 November 2017
Great Visuals. Poor character development. Its (bad) SciFi that doesn't feel like the star trek franchise.,28 February 2021
"The tension on this show is amazing and I can't wait to watch the next episode. Already so much has happened and we're only 2 episodes in.

I can't believe all the negative reviews. Yes it's a departure from some of the old Trek but so was TNG from TOS and to some extent so was DS9 from most Treks (darker and grittier). And let's be honest TOS was made in the 50's and was a pretty bad show. Whoever holds that show as the standard bearer for the franchise can't be trusted. Come to think of it TNG, DS9 and Voyager also had lots of haters in the beginning and they're now beloved. I'm convinced this will happen with this show too.

I like the female leads and thought that aspect was quite refreshing. And no there's nothing SJW about it...who says females can't lead space vessels in the future? Isn't that what Star Trek has always been about? Star Trek has been about what's possible and about inspiring young minds to aspire for excellence and curiosity. Star Trek is about dreaming and dreams have no limits. If that's what holds you back, you're not a Star Trek fan.

Yes some of the acting and interacting was a bit wooden and awkward but I feel that they'll get settled quite well. Look at TNG, DS9 and Voyager...terrible the first couple of seasons but they got better and settled into a great rhythm.

My only advice to the producers is to ignore the negative reviews. If you can't connect with them, then connect with a new audience. TNG, DS9 and Voyager also had lots of haters in the beginning...it takes time. Don't give up.

OK I lied, that's not my only advice. My other advice is to not try to do too much. That's what Enterprise's mistake was. They tried to do too much, to create too many enemies, too many problems, too much drama, too much noise and ...well it was just overbearingly unwatchable.

Discovery shows promise by having a more measured pace and building tension slowly but effectively. I quite like it. Although, I do have to agree, I'm not a huge fan of these new Klingons. I didn't think they needed updating nor do I think it was a good update. Anyway, it doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the show too much.",25 September 2017
"I wrote a really negative review of Discovery after season 1. I was so disappointed with the storyline, the character and filmning in generel.

But i continued watching, hoping it would get better. And i have to admit, that it has gotten a lot better. Half Way through Season 2 it started to get good. And season 3 has been even better.

The story is good, however not perfect. But good. Its the small funny moments where you get to smile that makes it good also. And those moments are defenetly there in season 3.

The story makes sense and there has been goos progress in the main storyline through out season 3 so you do not ger bored, bit still its not beeing rushed.

I am looking forward to season 4 i must say.",9 January 2021
Realy liked this show. Lots of haters here on this review section. I would suggest not reading them. Just watch the show.,25 March 2019
"Don't let the floods of 1 star reviews influence you - there are a lot of die hard fans of the original star trek shows who don't like change.

As a long-time star trek fan myself, I can understand some of the criticism - Yeah the changes to the Klingons was extreme, the heavy prosthetics take away a lot of the expression from their scenes, and their dialogue is painfully slow.

But a star trek show has never had a story arc this interesting before, this trek is pushing into new territories, and is overall much darker and plot driven than traditional series, which I think suits a modern audience better.

It still retains some aspects of the original. I have appreciated the contrast of the traditional federation values of scientific inquisitiveness & exploration against the desperation of being at war, but I think this is pushing star trek into new places.

The tone of the show overall feels much closer to battle star than TNG or Voyager, which I think is actually a good thing. We have had those shows already, and more of the same would probably not go down super well with modern audiences.

I recommend giving it a try. The first 2 or 3 episodes are quite different to the rest of the series, where it settles down into a more standard episodic format.

I've enjoyed season 1 so far, and I'm quite excited for where this will go.",3 November 2017
"I found the first season to be fairly entertaining but soon after in the second season so much emphasis was placed on making a political statement and not on creating a quality and entertaining actual Star Trek series that I lost almost all interest in the show. It actually becoming boring and I had to force myself through one too many episode to actually enjoy myself. The dialogue was stale and unenlightening. The portrayals of the characters were trite and very unconvincing. I soon stopped even wanting to see certain characters appear on the screen. The storylines were so uninspiring and meandering that more interesting things happen at a McDonalds every Friday night. If you want a more true, loyal, and really entertaining version of Star Trek, view Star Trek Strange New Worlds.",17 August 2023
"I have recently watched Enterprise and really liked it. Wanted more, do I picked up Discovery. Enterprise was good but felt PG like the original Star Trek with Shatner . Discovery feels more adult and full of action. I'm ok with the changes they have made with the characters looks, I really like Christopher Pike and how Anson portrays him. I thought NG was boring with all the talk with Picard and Number One. It felt old!! Haven't watched Voyager or DSN. At least not yet.",8 February 2020
"I can honestly say being a avid Star Wars fan and never really gave much thought to Star Trek... after seeing the trailer for Discovery on Netflix, I thought well I will give this ago. Well done!!! I'm now a fan of the Star Trek franchise (well Discovery) i was able to bing on series 1&2 in about a week whilst off with the kids and now I sit in anticipation for series 3,4 &5.",4 March 2020
"I have been a fan of star trek since the beginning and i dont know why this show gets so much bad reviews,you cant expect to have the same vision of the future today that we had in next generation,i think the show has to evolve with the era we live in,please live in the present",12 February 2020
It's not anywhere near as bad as all these reviews make out. Very different to the usual corny Star Trek series but pays just enough respect to the past. SFX visuals are exceptional but stories can be way too convoluted. It tries a bit too hard to be clever. Most characters are somewhat interesting but the attempt to include every aspect of society comes across as forced. It's an above average show but not anywhere the exceptional content available these days.,3 December 2020
"For a guy who has only watched the new Star trek I actually liked the first two episodes. I was never bores, the visuals were great, the acting felt acceptable and good. Loved the conflicts, action, CGI, aliens and music.

Compared to most other Sci-Fi (space) series this is far far above average. Other comparable new Sci-Fi shows are shows such as ""The Expanse"", ""The Orville"", and ""Killjoys"". Compared to those series it isn't bad, far above Killjoys, on par with the Expanse and the Orville.

Giving this show a 1 - 4 seems unfair to me. 1 - 4 is hot garbage. 5 is meh/decent. 6 is decent/good. 7 is good/great. I would say that this show is between a 7 and an 8 IMO.

I am looking forward to see the rest of the show, and I feel its serious tone works for it, since the humorous and more relaxed tone is already covered by ""The Orville"".

Sorry for my grammar, English isn't my native language.",25 September 2017
"Howcome the rating is over 7 ? Uhhh...I just do not get it. As a Star Trek show, it has failed uttterly. As a show, it also has failed utterly. The writing is for 4 year olds who don't know about cause and effect, logic, or science or human behavior yet. I could go on but why bother. So HOWCOME? Uhhh...I just do not get it.",14 January 2021
"I just wanted to write this review as I see so many ancient nerds who favour original star trek and original star wars over new content. THE OLD STAR WARS WASN'T THAT F. AMAZING. Neither was Star Trek. This on the other hand is very interesting and I can't wait for the new episode each week.

Try it out!",16 October 2017
"Every season gets worse but Season 4 has topped the charts with idiotic storytelling and more crying and hugging than ever. Earlier seasons at least had great cast members which helped the overall story such as Lorca, Captain Pike, Captain Philipa/Empress and so on, now we don't even have that. The show is more of a refection of the current 'politically correct' view prevailing in the USA than a futuristic sci-fi series breaking traditional barriers. Once it was a series which casted a black woman in a lead cast way ahead of time but never used it as a sub-plot for the stories, now it is more of 'look I'm gay or I go by these pronouns'. The dark matter anomaly is forgotten, lead black cast member just hugs everyone and is instrumental in every thing the federation does. She not only saved the Federation from Klingons, but then the Federation from the Federation itself, all sentient life in the galaxy from an AI and now she is single-handedly steering slash saving the political missions of the Federation too. It's like nobody else is capable of doing anything unless the lead woman of color who is hardly 40 and a newbie Captain intervenes. The crew spends most of the time casting looks of admiration at her, when they are not doing it they are mostly crying and hugging each other. It was sufferable till season 3 but now it's just a colossal collection of people who will not survive on the planet living simple lives let alone be part of a space faring pseudo-militaristic organisation such as the Federation. My opinion is if you want to watch it, keep one finger on the forward button, you'll be pressing it a lot.",12 December 2021

Actors are great, plot is great. I loved next generation and deep space nine. I also like new star trek movies and I think new series is like these new movies. So If you like new movies, you like new series. If you hate movies, you hate this. :D

Give chance for this series and it is great!!! And I think best Star Trek series! If you like old plastic Halloween Klingons, new Klingons are too realistic for you. :P",5 November 2017
Hater gonna hate. People who grew up with this show cant seem to let go of what was and allow for the evolution of past work. All shows and movies of all genres evolved from something else. This will continue to happen. You can either experience this for what it is (a great new star trek show) or go cry in a corner with the rest of the haters.,23 April 2018
"U guys might of watched the original series of ST.. I might be a younger generation.. but I've watched most of the movies, DS9, Voyager,.. this is not just a good but a great successor! I'm sorry that all of you ""fanboys"" that are from the ""past generation"" are hurt.. but it's not all about the color of the uniform and throwing rocks made of paper and foam (grow up please.. we're in the 21century...the next generation).The CGI is superb, the scenes are great, the character is deeper and the dialog is far superior and more complex. While I do agree the ""original"" characters are better.. I strongly feel that STD deserves the spot of being ""one of the greats""! Voyager was the last great ST... and this one... well... like I said... is ""The Next Generation""!",17 January 2019
"You could consider this STAR TREK if the first STAR TREK movie/show you ever watched was 'STAR TREK: INTO THE DARKNESS' but then you wished that it was more like GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY.

Sorry to butcher a great quote but ""Beam me up Scotty, there is no great DISCOVERY here.""",16 October 2017
"The show is set in the Prime Universe. It does have an aesthetic change. To make the technology look more modern than they had in the 60's. That and updating the Klingon's look again, like they did with Star Trek: The Motion Picture, seems to be a road to far for the anal ""fans"" who can't accept change. I.D.I.C. Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations. A concept that Gene Roddenberry came up with for the Vulcan people. It's a concept that fans who get it understand. It means having an open mind for differences. I've been a Trekkie for 35+ years. My Star Trek was/is TOS. I got into Star Trek before TNG was even a concept. Star Trek and my mom, taught me to be open to change and new experiences. So whenever something changed, be it a new show, or a new take on the canon, I accepted it and learned to at the bare minimum, like it. So, I do like some iterations more than others. That being said, if Star Trek: Discovery continues on with the same quality as it's opening 2 episodes, it'll end up my second favorite Star Trek iteration. The point of Star Trek, is to have a social commentary on current events and try and make a change for the better with great storytelling. They changed canon. Which some supposed fans just can't handle. If they actually understood Star Trek, they would have more open minds. Star Trek has never been about pew pew shoot 'em up action taking precedence over the morality of the deeper story. If they can't handle that, then they are like the people who think anyone with an ounce of empathy is a ""social justice warrior"". Star Trek has ALWAYS been about empathy and understanding brave new worlds. To understand new life and new civilizations. To try and go where no one has gone before. So, if you are an actual fan with an open mind to differences and change, you will, like me, love this new show. I recommend Star Trek: Discovery highly! 10 out of 10!",30 September 2017
"This series is fantastic, I believe a lot of the negativity is based on the facts there are black and lgbt actors in leading roles.",15 September 2021
"I was nearly jumping out of my skin with excitement, at the screening of the pilot of STD. It has taken me some time - OK, it has taken me 9 episodes to get nearly comfortable with ANY of the characters, the style of theater, the camera work, and the storytelling style.

First, the Klingons. When I saw and heard the Klingons for the first time....my blood pressure....went down. What an absolute let down. As many before me have said, the massive inconsistency between shows is just inexcusable. And so are the little red plastic Lego pieces adorning the shoulders of the Klingons. I'd hate to see the wardrobe designer's house. I bet it looks like an Italian Wedding. all dots mixed with florals and zebra stripes. What happened to the gorgeous Michael Dorn look? Why fix something that ain't broke??

Second, when the first subtitle came on, I thought ""HoH jih Dah""......oh, you want subtitles?? ""kill me now."" Seriously guys? Everyone loves a good Klingon word or two. No one loves to listen to it for half an episode when it sounds like your grandfather choking on a snail - OK, you can tell I absolutely HATE the way the Klingons in this series are portrayed.And those noses. Shoot me.

I actually have NO bone to pick with the actors. Particularly the lovely Jason Isaacs. Love him. Love his character. Burnham- I have issue with the writing of her character though, right from the start. It's all based around the premise that she caused a war. She was given a direct order to just do a fly-by on that space walk mission. I find it very hard to believe that a second in command would completely ignore her orders, and keep on ignoring them when it was obvious something was up. It's also dumb that she's being treated as more of a VIP than the current 2IC, Saru, whom we barely know and has, so far, only messed up a mission. Why would Lorca have such a dumb 2IC?? He's nearly always wrong in his assumptions, nearly always gazumped when he gives an opinion. And seriously WHO CARES about the gender identity of the doctor and Stamets !!!! Why can't we just have storyline??? I hate that we haven't met the Chief Medical Officer. The doctor is such a fun and important part of Star Trek series.

I love Tilly. And I like that she's not a glamour. I do wonder why she's absolutely EVERYWHERE. All the time. Like there's no one else manning the star ship, or should I say womaning the star ship since everything in this ST is so damn politically correct. I hate that it's politically correct. It's much more a reflection of 2017 than of it's own time.

I dislike the story telling modus operandi. I much prefer capsule stories, like on TNG and Voyager. I don't mind a few story arcs, but this one is serialized. It's annoying and most unsatisfying. Furthermore, capsule style stories are a much more effective way of introducing characters and getting to know them.

Where is the Chief Medical officer? Why is the CMO not the main person in charge of the human participation in the Spore Propulsion jumps. I find it hard to believe he wouldn't poke his head in when Stamets becomes a bumbling, jumbled tangle of mangled brain cells.

The writing is poor, and a poor effort in consideration of all the material that has gone before it. Again, you don't fix something that's not broken, and this series seems to be determined to change EVERYTHING - new broom sweeps absolute clean, including all the foundation rules of the Federation and Starfleet - ah...insubordination, the prime directive, and really?? swearing?? Sylvia let out the F bomb twice. I think there was a 'sh-- or two in earlier episodes as well. Now, I don't care if she's on the F-ing spectrum or not. If I want to listen to the F-bomb I'll turn on Rob Dyrdek and Riculousness. What is peeing me off, is that on one hand the show is trying to be Little Mr.Politically correct, (gender, ADHD, female leads etc...) and yet completely ignoring Star Trek and Starfleet correctness, a culture that has been built up over 50 years (here on ACTUAL planet earth) and hundreds of years in the Star Trek Universe. I doubt writers have watched all 5 series. I really do. If they did, they would notice a continuum. Hellooooo!!! I envisage a bunch of 30-something failed journalism graduates who fancy themselves pretty famous right now.

Shame the uniforms don't fit well. Hate the silver and gold. Very materialistic (ha ha) and 21st century economy. Don't mind the blue, but should have incorporated the gold, blue and red in some minor way instead.

What's with the camera angles? You in High school??

the best thing? Lorca and love Michelle Yeoh and James Frain. Perfectly cast. Keep up Writers, for the love of God. Oh sorry, too politically incorrect for you???",26 November 2017
"The new and upgraded star trek universe with Picard and now Discovery is just right up top in my view. The last startrek movie trilogy was simply fantastic and the characters actors the storyline it was simply a treat. Discovery started slow in the first season....but the way the story develped and characters took shape it draws you into a whole new dimension of Startrek...while bringing back old memories and characters beautifully. Storyline and scripting is done very well and its very refreshing....and that itself says a lot...i mean over the last many decades...to still find exciting places and worlds.. to go where no one has ever been... is simply outstanding. The cast and characters ,their chemistry and some super cgi makes this a very delicious watch indeed. Enjoy the new age startrek!",9 January 2021
"Amazing series, it awakened my inner nerd. Despite some not really scientific, but more fantasy/magical, things and the high level of political correctness. It didn't get too pushy or annoying to me, which is the case with many others series nowadays. I am a bit worried about the new season though. Looking at the new writer her resume, I fear it will bring more political correctness. Anyway, so far it is a great series and I would rate it 9 stars.",22 August 2019
"This once decent show turned into a ""woke"" s...tshow. Did they fire all writers who could make a proper plot and screenplay? Fireworks from behind of wall panels on the spaceship in 32nd century? This is now unbearable to continue to watch.",4 December 2021
"Star trek fan when i was Young, But love the new type of story telling, plot twists and good acting even more. This is one of the lowest rated star treks. But that is just plain rubbish. They deserve more appreciation and a bronze or even silver medal. Love iT. Star trek next generation is unbeatable. But this is better than voyager or deep space nine.",22 March 2019
"This is not Star Trek. It is a disjointed and chaotic attempt to imitate the classic sci-fi series. Judge it on its own merit, but it cannot be compared to Star Trek of any iteration as it is a Star Trek series in name only. This is why 1 star is correct. Even as 'another' sci-fi series it falls well below par.

When watching, put Star Trek out of your mind and decide if you'd spend a few minutes watching this mash up if it weren't for the stolen title. I doubt it. Go to IMDB or your favorite online movie source and find the best sci-fi offerings to watch.",28 February 2019

"Totally excellent take on star trek, I disagree with negative reviews, this series is well directed, adds its own layer, with characterization and science, to the story...",31 December 2018
"I am not going to sit here and say that this show is bad. I am, though, going to say, as far as I watched so far, that this is amazing. I love the introduction of other species. I also love the way they did their Klingons. I hated TOS Klingons, in how they looked like made up Romulans, with bad mustaches. The plot, to me, is simple, direct, and there were some twists, but good ones. What I hated in every other Star Trek series was the episodes that absolutely were a waste of fim, which really took off when Gene died. And started before, especially in TNG. There were several episodes that went absolutely no where, did nothing to grow any characters, or anything else, and was a waste of time, money, and just a filler for the next episode. I loathed DS9 because of the above, and Voyager was much the same right from the gate. The only other show that did a little, but far less than this, was Enterprise. Which I also really liked. This, to me, is closer to what Star Trek should have been. Should have had a ton less go no where, do absolutely nothing episodes, without any growth to the characters, or the show. The one that I thought was like that, was the second Mudd episode. I was about to stop watching, altogether, after that one episode if something did not change between characters. And there was growth in that episode, and later on. I saw where the Klingons wanted to remain ""pure."" I do not believe that this meant racially pure. Rather, I believe it meant culturally pure. They did not want to be a ""puppet"" of Starfleet, or humans, like they perceived other species like the Vulcans, Andorians, etc. Which would have a degenerative effect on their culture. Before someone claims that this is a racial, and not cultural, it is, actually, cultural in nature, and not racial. They want to preserve their heritage, and have their fights, and battles, and not give up them. Having Starfleet around would stop that from happening. They are a warrior people, and they try to fight their way into their version of heaven, which is Sto-Vo-Kor. An honorable death gets you there, anything else, well, you are going to hell. I do apologize for my brief usage of language there, but that is, basically where they go. And it would stain the honor of their house to have a warrior so cast. ( Yes I am enough of Klingon fan to know this, and remember it from reading it, but I can't remember the names of the Klingon afterlife, aside from their version of heaven, sorry.) One thing I hated in Star Trek previously was the absolute techno-babble that was thrown in, as well as the politics, religion, and other things. This show doesn't have all of that. Jefferies tubes I will accept, as well as transporters, and other things, but don't feed me other stuff that has no real use anywhere but in Trek. Oh, and I love the rebooted movies. They were actually quite good, and quite well done. I would love to have seen Star Trek the series rebooted from there. But until it's done, I will like Discovery. I just hope they don't waste time in finding another Checkov I loved the actor who played him. He was great. I will miss him. And I will say that Chris Pine is a better Kirk than Shatner will ever be. He's not wooden, or broken. He's alive and smooth. ""But (long pause) I've got to (pause) Mister!"" That drove me nuts. The people that save TOS were McCoy, Scotty, Spock, Uhuara, and all the rest. The rebooted movies went from great to awesome really quick. Benedict Cumberbatch as Kahn, amazing.",19 May 2018
"I enjoyed the first season, and loved the first episode of season 2, and then the rot set in.

Episodes 3 and 4 are the first ones I couldn't watch all the way through. The script writing has become messy and confusing.

I'm pretty sure the script writers think they know what they are doing, but Imjave no idea what they were thinking.

They have ruined what was, a great series.",8 February 2019
"I don't usually write reviews, but I felt obliged to do so, because of all the fake 1-2-3 star reviews! This show is amazing and deserves more than its current 7.3 score! The characters are great, the acting is top notch and the stories are interesting and they keep you engaged! Yes it is not the usual Star Trek show, but I would say its amazing and I was waiting impatiently for the new season!",15 October 2020
"Thats it; Kurtzman doesn't get Star Trek,post Discovery series show progress but STD is so off that it should not be under same franchise. Its good sci-fi but in its entirety looks like they taken star trek buzz words and mixed them with random stuff just to make a show.",21 February 2022
"Wow! This is getting quite a bit of hate from some folks. Perhaps it's perspective. I have enjoyed Star Trek for many years in it's many incarnations, but I would not consider myself a Trekkie. I do not feel offended by this show at all, since in my opinion, it does respect the adventurous spirit of the original and does not impugn any beloved characters from the past. Does it change the past a bit? Sure, but not in an ugly or disrespectful way. So Spock's parents were kind enough to take in an orphaned child.... actually ups their cred with me.

This is a bit darker than the original, but ST:TNG got dark at times, too. The times they are a changing, and the franchise itself will continue to evolve as long as it lasts. Only retired franchises do not evolve and grow. Everything is informed by the time in which is was created, be it people, graphic art, cinema, novels, music, dinner, or new Star Trek series. So of course this is not Star Trek circa the 1960's, or even the 1980's. It's Star Trek circa the 21st century with creators, actors and writers who live in the here and now with the concerns of the here and now. As long as I am being entertained, that has never bothered me since it is true of every program I have ever watched. In the past, just as now, I may agree or disagree with the expressed position on social issues, but if the show is good, I'm willing to watch. I don't feel the need to agree with everyone or surround myself with people who agree with me. Is this the best series I've ever watched? No. But after the actors and writers got a grip on their characters and how their characters interact with each other, it's an enjoyable show as well as an intriguing show. There seems to be a camaraderie that develops over the 2 seasons between the cast that I enjoyed seeing develop.

To me, the biggest change is that this series does focus on developing character relationships more than previous series. Not just the ones the characters are born or adopted into, but the ""family"" they choose as they move through life. How those circumstances and choices guide characters, sometimes astray, as they try to define themselves through, and sometimes despite, those people given and chosen. Michael Burnham's complicated family life is the center of this exploration, but with all the characters, we see how family, or the lack of, and history has formed them. So while the Star Fleet creed to explore, learn and advance is still an important theme, so is that theme of family ties, relationships with peers, mentors, lovers and defining ourselves individually while navigating those bonds. And hostile Klingons, a mysterious prototype ship, and a few surprises I enjoyed in the telling. Is too Star Trek.",14 September 2020
"It's all about perspective and expectations. So, let me start with (my) recap of ST series. First was Captain Kirk's Star Trek. Basically a western made into Sci-Fi. When it came out we were all neophytes to technology. Basically it taught us how to embrace and accept new ideas. Second was Captain Picard's Star Trek. Unbearably arrogant and self-righteous. Every character was clean, perfect, and... boring. Along comes DS9. At least in DS9 it wasn't all candy floss and lolly-pops. Voyager was a little grittier, but still perfect people living a perfect life. For all its flaws Star Trek Enterprise at least tried to show us that humans 'had to work...and work hard at being idealistic and noble'. Its biggest flaw was embracing the 'sex sells philosophy'. Sorry all, my thoughts are running so much faster than my ability to type! I think the biggest problem people are having is trying to place each series in a chain...all being relevant to each other. Myself, I watch each one by itself...I don't even consider comparing one to another...it just doesn't work! Unlike some, I do not see the shows as being about love and peace, and everyone getting along. Almost every episode of each series suspends the ST moral code, to be replaced by unparalleled violence and fighting. Sooo, this current show - has quite good acting, maybe not the best, but like all previous shows many of the actors are for the most part, new to the game...learning their craft as they go. I'm alright with that. The effects are stunning. What technology has done to film making is sad, really. But to not make use of the tools is naïve at best, at least in Sci-Fi. I think it is wrong to vilify the series because it has tech that wasn't seen in other shows. I think it is wrong to vilify the portrayal of characters (Klingons, specifically) because they aren't like other versions. This is this...and that was that. Guess what I'm saying is watch but don't expect it to be the same. For myself, what grabbed me first was the intro theme. Just listening to it put me into Star Trek mode. New characters, new ideals, new dilemmas, new attitude. For me, the excitement is seeing the development...the growth of each character. Not trying to peg them into a rigid framework. Just watch the damn thing and enjoy...or hate it and don't watch it. It's really that simple. Finally, I'll say this - The writers/producers, to some extant, try to input some slant to the message they create with the story. Its up to us to accept, refute or ignore it. I think a lot of the nastiness being hurled at this show reflects the nastiness building in society today.",1 November 2017
"S1 - Great start.

S2 - Astounding look into the Mirror universe S3 - Ok but started to verge into the silly towards the end S4 - O. M. G.

From the off we are treated to hand wringing whining, psychobabble and an entire episode of Tilly being nervous.

I got two episodes in before deciding this season had gone to far into the bore-verse.

They always say that ST mirrors the times we live in - from TOS gung ho to Next Gen boardroom battles and not to Discovery writers getting to the heart of their characters through emotional hand wringing.

To be clear - diverse casting and people are not the issue. Bring on more. But turning the show into a Millennial soul searching session does us and them a disservice.

Shame.",6 May 2022
"Of course this is not TOS, nor is it TNG, DS9, Voyager or Enterprise. But then, none of them pretended to be what had come before, either. As someone old enough (and lucky enough) to have seen TOS when it first aired, I have always had a soft spot in my heart and mind for it, and later series were always judged by me, harshly, against the original. Nothing has ever lived up to TOS, imho, BUT...when not unfairly judged against something so beloved, the other series, all of them...and now Discovery, have managed to shine IN THEIR OWN UNIQUE WAY. I understand how some cannot accept something so different, but to compare any series in the franchise to any other is unfair to all, except perhaps TNG, DS9 and VOYAGER, which existed more or less at the same time. But even they contained anomalies from one to another. Bad special effects? Seriously? All reviews that make this claim I discount entirely, since the effects are AMAZING for a TV series. As to characters and character development, as well as plot lines, I am willing to give everyone on-board time to find their stride. After all, you cannot bake an apple pie if you only just planted the apple trees.",26 November 2017
"I never write reviews, but this show has gotten so bad I had to comment. And from the other reviews I seem to have company.

I consider myself a social ""moderate"" (BLM, Woman's rights, Gay rights, no body shaming, etc) but when writers of a series punch me in the face over and over in an extreme fashion with the ""woke-ness"" it is too much. As so many have said in these reviews it has become a boring soap opera. Has there been one episode this season without crying? Just to be clear I mean on the show because its gotten so bad I do feel like crying a little. :) Even worse the plots are rehash of others in the series. This week Discovery gets ""stuck"" in a black void and cannot get out until the last second with the help of an emotional computer? Whatever happened to shows that were meant to entertain and not preach?",24 December 2021

"So I've been called a Trekkie for a long time, and I have been waiting a long time for a new Trek, honestly I'm just happy.

We live in 2017, not in the 1960's or 1990,s. Times have evolved, television has evolved and the old Star Trek wouldn't work today anyways.

So a new crew a new vision and a new way of telling a story, It works!

Maybe not for all the hard-core Trekkies out there, who somehow became hell bend on the fact that things shouldn't change.... seriously that is so against the concept of science fiction...

But I started watching this with my 11 year old son and 14 year old daughter, who both couldn't sit out 10 minutes of the next generation, guess what there hooked.

And that's what it is, a new Star Trek for a younger generation.",5 October 2017
"I had a little trouble getting into discovery. It took many seasons to understand the author's intentions.

Daring a story in which we don't present heroes, but people who feel bad about themselves.

Any story usually presents examples to ordinary people, not here ; the authors seem to have wanted to offer complexed personalities, borderlines, non-binaries, ASD (Stammets is clearly ASD), victims of genocide or harassment, who have not overcome a mourning, a story to try to help this audience who has suffered to believe in integration.

It's confusing for a ""neurotypical"" or someone who hasn't experienced this kind of suffering, boring maybe, but no matter, it's not the target audience : since This series is intended to be a therapy.",17 August 2023
"I'm sorry, it's impossible.

Please for the love of God, it's the future. It's not present day.

Stop shoving present day politics into a television show about space exploration. The writers are supposed to rise above our present day drama and imagine a different time.

If we wanted a present day teen drama, we'd watch a different show.

How this was given the green light I'll never understand?",17 December 2021

Everyone has so many problems, just so 'lets make sure everyone's well being is OK' I liked the first few seasons but this one is all about making sure.........i cant go on.........so bloody annoying.

"I have not read consistent reviews, only nonsensical babbling of haters who seem to have never seen the previous sagas of the series. From acting complaints (in the same series that has had dear Shatner doing ... well, Shatner), technobabble complaints (in Star Trek!), even crying over 'filler episodes' (when in previous sagas half of the more than twenty episodes per season were filler). ""Oh, this is very 'crying' or 'emotional' ..."" Excuse me, but: What old Trek series did these purists watch? Because Star Trek was always about these topics: humanity, fear and betrayal vs. courage and trust, loneliness, mutual aid, wonder at the unknown, and the idea that humanity can be better in the future than we were in the past. And that hatred and cruelty should not be our tool, never. Don't listen to haters.

"I have been a Star Trek fan since I was a little boy, I remember watch the Original Series with my dad, and the movies with Capt. James T. Kirk, and the next generation, if it had the U. S. S Enterprise I knew I was going to like it. Then came DS9 I never really got into that one but I did enjoy Voyager. When this one came out I was not sure how it would go, but I love it, it is my second favorite after Capt. Kirk Star Trek. The actress that plays Capt. Burnham is amazing she is captivating and really brings you into the scene. She is very Kirk like which is why I think I like it so much, she goes against the status quo sometimes to do the right thing. And shows that sometimes you have to stand for your principles. In this day and age it is nice to see what we can become if we just take a few lessons from Star Trek.",10 July 2022

What i like the most was that it tells the story of the beginnings of star trek and its individual characters. So to say it was all about Michael would not be entirely true.

"I normally never write a review. I personally don't think everyone should be entitled to have an 'opinion' on the internet, because it only makes us as humanity even more negative and harsh.

But when I saw the so called Trekkies bash this new series in the Star Trek Universe, I couldn't help but think by myself what nasty people there are.

To be quite frankly, when I read the harsh and utterly negative reviews I feared the worst for this new installment. Now we are four episodes far and boy, am I glad I didn't listen too carefully and just gave it a well deserved chance. Star Trek Discovery IS Star Trek to be simply put, but in a more modern jacket. Yes, the purist will hate it for some and other mystified reasons, but don't let them fool you with their bitterness. IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MUCH WORSE!

The acting is good, the CGI is very neat and the universe presented is very very cool. No more, no less. Every SF adept should give this series a chance, only for the sake of pure amusement.",9 October 2017
"I have been a huge fan of Star Trek since I was young, and this series was breathtakingly beautiful and wonderful. It's not your typical Star Trek series, and it is different. They tried something new and I think they did a great job on it. It doesn't follow the usual episodic format, and it is more like a long movie.

This series doesn't deserve all the 1/10 people are leaving. At least give points where it's due, like the amazing visuals in this series. I have a feeling that most of these 1/10 reviewers never actually got past the first few episodes. Many of the people leaving these negative remarks are just parroting all the other negative reviews without watching the entire series for themselves. It starts slow, but it gets better as it goes on. I thought it was going to be horrible due to the reviews here myself, but it wasn't once I went past the first couple of episodes. If you are truly a fan of this series, give it a chance.",7 April 2018
"My love of Star Trek goes back to the original series. Then there were TNG, DS9, VOY, and ENT, each of which I enjoy to varying degrees. The newer Abrams movies were somewhat enjoyable as well.

After the first two episodes of Discovery, I was disappointed, but I decided to plug on with my CBS All Access free trial. I'm glad that I did. The show kept gaining momentum, and the characters became more and more well developed. It's different from other series, but I like it.

I do hate the sound editing. I have to turn up my TV to 50 to hear some of the conversations, and then I get blown away by loud special effects. Very uneven.",25 July 2020

"Having been a ""trekkie"" since the first episode back in the 60's and through all the iterations since, this is a refreshing take on the series. It works well with the recent reboot movie timelines, and if you are prepared to give it a go, it works well as a step in between Enterprise and TOS.

Remember Enterprise devoted a whole season to a war with an alien race hell bent on earths destruction.

In the TOS the Klingons were the inherent ""known"" enemy and there were plot points that alluded to the past wars including the Klingon/Federation neutral zone, so there's your war reference again.

As it's been too long between series, so I'm giving this one a big thumbs up for effort and a fresh take on the story.

And there's nothing wrong with presenting a female as the main character, it was handled well by Kate Mulgrew with Voyager and Sonequa is doing a fine job.

I particularly like the inherent ""suspicion"" in Captain Lorca's motives, but he also has nobel intentions and is a typical ""I'll get this done even if it kills us"" kind of military anti-hero - there were plenty of those in TOS and TNG so nothing unusual here.

Congratulations on a fine effort, and it's not meant to be TOS - it's a stand alone, much like the book series ""Star Trek - New Frontiers"" was/is, so sit back relax and enjoy",5 January 2018
"First I never write a review but felt like I had to for this one.

I wanted to like this but I found the casting was so bad. First of all Pike was a gorgeous man in the original and this one is nowhere near even being good looking. And what happened to his vividly blue eyes. Poor casting.

Spock is just as bad. This Spock looks nothing like the original. He looks like a pasty white human with some poor makeup. Very unrealistic looking.

I found the story line weak and more of a serial than individual episodes.

I'm into season 2 now expecting it to get better and feel like may have to kick myself for watching this long.

There was so much possibility here that just missed even being good.

About the only thing good are the sets and the wardrobe.",14 February 2022
"I too grew up with Star Trek. I don't know what to tell you, I really enjoy STD. It's visually very interesting and I enjoy Bernham very much in the lead (yet not Captain) role.

Season 2 has cleaned up some of the main problems I was having with the show (melodrama and odd Klingon representation and sometimes both together) ... I think it's continuing to get better as we go.

In a sea of 1/10 I thought it might be good to get a different perspective on here.

I admit the visual digression of Klingons into an orc like species is odd however i suspect, as the storyline unfolds, to learn more about Klingon evolution; mostly their near human appearance 10 years later in ""StarTrek: Original Series."" In closing, i found the first season to be an exceptional addition to the StarTrek cannon which is why I chose to write this my first review.",5 August 2018
"While the first season created a rift between fans, who that thought that this new Star Trek could never be canon, and those patient enough to see how it could be canon. Both seasons showed the influence on Star Trek, by the Abrams universe. The second season brought forth all of the expectations that fans had for this new Star Trek into clarity. While some might find it too politically correct, we have to remember that this future is void of the religious and nationalist ideals that continue to hold back our species today, like Gene Roddenberry envisioned. Like the widely loved show The Expanse, the future of the sci-fi space drama is in great hands!",3 May 2019
"I'm writing this with only the last episode of season 3 unwatched.. TNG is what I fell in love with back in the 90s and in the last few years I caught up on VOY and ENT. Yes this is a new different show than back then but that doesn't make it bad. Every show today has emotion/crying/whispering that pushes drama and Discovery is no different. Everyone hates what's new and resists change. These first 3 season are great sci-fi action drama. I know my opinion isn't the popular one but it has to be said. Discovery is doing a sci-fi on the level of Walking Dead and Breaking Bad and should continue for another 10 seasons. Yes I agree with most things said in other reviews about everything is ""woke"" but it really doesn't bother me because the world is changing and so is television. The sci-fi story is still there yet people focus on the trivial ish. Another thing said often is that Michael is the center of it all and I will agree but that still doesn't ruin it and I've noticed other character development starting to happen and love it. Please everyone let's not kill this just because of little things. We will look back on this series the same way we see TNG and VOY now. I'd rather this than a space opera. Looking forward to more of Discovery and Picard. 10 out of 10 for me.",1 January 2021

"I heard that when Discovery was first pitched the concept was an anthology series following a different crew every season.

But what we got was just an awful chaotic and very messy show.

Star Trek Discovery messed, changed and retconned so much long(55+yrs) established canon.

And then there is the weird whispering, out of place drama, dark but flashy surroundings, the many cringy moments, THE KLINGONS, weird romances, they have made a Star Trek into a soap in Space.

Having been a star trek die hard fan since voyager and DS9 aired and having invested alot of time and money in the community and on merch my conclusion of Discovery is that it is Bad and Should Not have existed.

Like so many other here, I have tried and watched and rewatched all the episodes but even after the fourth time my conclusion still stands.",14 December 2022

I do not normally write reviews but felt compelled to because of some of the negative and outright mean reviews. I've watched bad shows and this is absolutely no where near being a bad show. It's sad that certain people can't see pass their own biases and enjoy a well written and executed show. Nonetheless, just give this show a try, it is worth it!",1 March 2020
"...for all those bored wannabe critics. You sit around and cry about the old days when a certain frachise didn't suck. You probably hate GOT and Walking Dead because they're not what they used to be.

And now this. A new Star Trek series with whole new charakters, in a whole new universe and a whole new way of telling Star Trek adventures. All you have to do now, is watch the first 3 Episodes, compare it to the old franchise and rate it with 1 star, because you are that exclusive!!!

For all those who are able to rise above the wine of the bored masses: watch this series!!!

The First season is a little bumby in the beginning, but tells interesting stories around the discovery and their crew. The second season is a master piece, which is absolutely not comparable to the old franchise. Every episode felt like I watched a 2 hour movie. Waaaaay better and with a lot more respect for the old series than those Star Wars Trek Movies which so desperatly tried what DSC actually achieved: A Star Trek for the next century.

Sometimes it comes off a little cheesy, sometimes it comes off a little too much and sometimes it is not at all like Star Trek. But that's ok dammit.

You can go ahead wining and hating everything that's not how it should be, cause it's new and different. Criticism is so much easier and so much more exclusive, you might actually feel that you opinion really matters.

For everyone else: Just give it a try. The series is worth it. In my opnion it's the best sci-fi series in years. 9 Stars",4 November 2019
"I'm a Star Trek forever fan. I used to tape the original series on cassette tapes before ther invention of VCRs for my dad when he couldn't be home. This is the best writing, the best story line, the best conception of Star Trek in ages. It's brilliant. The casting, the story arcs, the commitment to the canon... impeccable.",7 January 2019
"Again, ridiculous nonsense. If a character like Michael Burnham were on the other Trek shows she would have never gotten out of the brig. You can't be a prisoner and still run the show. Very weak Ship's Captain. Very poor writing and horrible stories. Who thinks this stuff up. Star Trek Picard is very good so far. Don't let these fools near that show or future ST.",6 April 2020
Much better than Enterprise and new ST movies. Mirror universe rules!,24 January 2018
Worse writing of any Sci-fi show ever. Plots are preposterous. Forces a woke agenda in just to make sure we know it is relevant and the dialog is stilted at best.,26 April 2022
"I don't get all the butt hurt Trekkies trying to come off as purists. This is a great new show. Good fun , amazing CGI , strong characters. I have been a star trek fan all of my 55 years. This show is fun , well acted and just a great escape.",30 January 2018
"Hi fellow fans this is my first review ever on any series or Movie I will highly recommend this to old and new fans of Star Trek or Sci-fi in general.

This is a breath of fresh Air in an very Matured and well known franchise and for all we know if the Original creators had our level of tech back then this would have been the result.

So my Only request to the current Star Trek Creators if you keep 1 tradition please keep the 7 season tradition :) Well Done I love it !!!",27 October 2017
"I honestly don't understand the negativity coming for this show. It's new, it's creative, it's fresh and captivating and dynamic and you want to root for all the characters! I get that ""Star Trek"" of the original was very much a groundbreaking era that still holds the hearts of many, but for a reboot next generation, this show knocks it out of the park. Can't wait for season 3!!",23 May 2019
Why is Burnham constantly whispering her lines. Ridiculous and to much emotional bull. To much like a soap opera. Worst star trek ever. And I have noticed the rest of the crew is starting to whisper all the time. I mean what's the point of all the whispering. Are all the crew constantly worried that someone is going to hear them?,12 March 2022
"I don't really understand some of the poor ratings here. Of course this isn't TOS, TNG, DS9, VOY, or even ENT but its absolutely Trek and so well written. Yes its darker and moodier but the essentials of Trek are there and in a form that brings this 23rd century forward into the 21st century.

There is a great depth of character and the story lines are well thought out leaving lots of twists and turns that always keep the viewer engaged while respecting the ideals of inclusiveness, optimism, science, and reason that makes the Star Trek Universe so compelling.",20 January 2018
"Here's the thing about Star Trek: despite all the crazy things that have gone on in the show and movies there was always a certain logic, certain rules, that held the boundaries of the Star Trek universe together. The shows did push those boundaries at times, and the more recent movies have been playing perilously close to the edge, but this latest instalment completely abandons them. Watch this show for 5 minutes (if you can stand it) and you will know what I mean. Any notion of ""science fiction"" has been left in the dust. This show is pure fantasy.

But beyond that, it's just bad. The acting is wooden. The characters are unlikable. The special effect seem fake. The writing is cliché after cliché. Nobody acts like you would expect real people to act. The cast seems to be picked solely to fulfill artificial race and gender quotas, to a point where it's noticeable. Such a menagerie might look good in some corporate boardroom but doesn't provide any actual value or chemistry to the show.

This show doesn't feel like ""Star Trek,"" it feels like a bad, low budget sci-fi show from an obscure TV channel. It makes a sad statement on the time we live in.",24 September 2017
When I was 23 years old there was a new series on TV called Star Trek. I found it very creative and enjoyed the weekly presentations. I was disappointed when it was cancelled. I have consumed every version since that beginning and have enjoyed all of them. A secret to enjoyment in this realm is to not make the mistake of trying to cross link the various adventures into one giant block of entertainment. Each version develops its own story line. I suppose those who judge this one so harshly are searching for something that no longer exists for if it did it would just be a rehash of old scripts and ideas. If you do not like this version there are plenty older versions for you to relive the adventures of your youth. As for me I enjoy the new ideas presented in the current productions of this and Piccard. They give fresh look at a very long series of adventures. I see comments on the actors and their abilities. Go back and take a look at the original and judge the acting as I am sure it will bring a smile to your face. I have another series than made a man very famous that I watch from time to time called Magnum ;) when I watch them I try not to judge but the acting is also hilarious at times and just another night time soap opera. This does not diminish the enjoyment received but perhaps is a comment on our changing tastes in entertainment. In short if you do not like do not watch it. The fan whining means little in the long run. Also if you are young and think you can do a better job by all means get off your rear end and show us. Talk is cheap...,11 March 2022
"I cannot understand all the bad reviews this is getting from you Trekkies. I grew up with Star Trek, because my father is a huge fan of the franchise and I even attended a convention. I was thrilled when I heard about the new show and the cast and I wasn't disappointed. I think they did a fantastic job in bringing Star Trek into the next century! Of course I still enjoy TNG or Voyager but not because of the great acting and special effects but because out of the sentiment and the often brilliant but sometimes also stupid storytelling. In my opinion the creators of Discovery brought newness to the Trek universe that was much needed. You complain that it is not Next Gen or original Star Trek, but just imagine a show like that for a 2017 audience!!! During the last decade TV-shows have emerged into a form of modern art, where visuals and great storytelling plus superb actors are key. Just look what is out there and tell me our much beloved TNG could compete with that. In my opinion they did a wonderful job so far in casting, visuals and storytelling! So back off haters and just enjoy Sci-Fi at its best!!! 9/10",16 October 2017
"In the war between the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises I will say Star Wars has won me over a very long time ago but I will admit I remember my self watching Star Trek on TV when I was younger. I liked it but never went crazy like I did with Star Wars. I see the critics, I see the reviews and I guess there from people that are big fans of the Star Trek saga and propably feel betrade from the producers but I like the show. I like it more than any DC TV show, I like even more than the last Star Wars movies!!! I guess it has to do with my taste but never the less even if the hole thing with Michael is getting a bit tiresome I like it and the show has win me over to look into the star trek universe more to learn about it and its characters and that I consider it as a win for the star treck franchise. I rather watch that all over again than watch shows like Brooklin nine nine, or dont know Black Lightning, Flash, Titans? So for begginers is a good intoduction and its worth any ones time. It might not be the grand master piece but Its far better than to many other shows on TV or Netflix right now. I am not an expert and thats my honest opinion. Thank you for reading this review",23 January 2021
I am a bit disappointed that The Borg is not Control.,13 July 2021
"The show starts with the premise that Dilithium mining is destroying planets, and a new ""spore"" drive, complete with its own arboretum in engineering, is many times faster. Ugh. The cast is 75% female (even the Klingon leader). , The lead male is a Kelpien who's species primary characteristic is a hypersensitivity to danger (he's always afraid). Expect for captain Pike with a secondary role in season 2, every straight white male is a villain. The lead female character is named Michael. And of course, every possible combination of LGBTQ has to be represented. Despite all of this the first 3 season are watchable. Could have probably rivaled TNG if they weren't so dead set on pushing a woke agenda. If you make it thru the first 3 seasons stop and be content to find another show. The 4th season devolves into an awful soap operator with half the dialog devoted to everyone's feelings.",27 March 2022
"Roddenberry in the sixty make a show for its time, now 50 years later, we have a new Star Trek, a new voyage, a new aventure and of course a new crew. Yes crew, contrary what are saying the haters which don't even see the show, she is not the real main character. The captain and the ""bad guy"" Klingon are the real main character. Anyway i have seen all the Star trek in the last 50 years of my existence and this one is one the best, the only raison i see so much hate and blindeness its because of the ideia of a main character which is not white. And that yes, will be turning Roddenberry in his grave :(",17 January 2018
"I just really don't like this version of Star Trek. I don't like any of the main characters, I don't like the most aspects of the story line from any of the seasons. I created a drinking game that will get any viewer drunk after watching any episode in season 4. Every episode seems to contain one or more therapy sessions, where a character or group of characters engages in a dialogue about their emotions and how they are feeling. Who wrote these broken, neurotic and narcissistic people, who require constant validation and group therapy to function? Gone are the good old days of NG, Voyager, DS9 and even Enterprise, where emotional gunk filler wasn't squashed into every episode in the place of interesting dialogue and a compelling story.

If you wanted woke Star Trek, then you got it. STD is the perfect abbreviation for this irritating mess.",2 January 2022
I just started watching this and i love it. Michael is a great protagonist. The Red Angel story arc was brilliant. I love the direction they are taking ST in with this series. I was a big fan of TNG and as i'm watching this i'm wondering how much better it would have been had they had access to the technology we have today. The battles are unmatched in Discovery.,5 April 2021
Shocked by how many trolls there are on IMDB now wow. Discovery takes a bit to find its footing but once it does it is a very compelling series that pushes the Star Trek canon in all the great ways we would hope for. The characters are well defined and the performances are top notch. Extra appreciation for Birnham and Spock.,5 November 2020
"Really sorry to read some of the negative reviews. Unlike every Star Trek parody since the original series (which I experienced in real time the night the episodes went to air) this series is actually SCIENCE fiction. It has not been made for general consumption, it has been made with the sense of adventure and factuality that resulted in myself and thousands of others choosing science as a career. It is outstanding to me to see original thinking based on what may be possible, not wild fantasy passing for science. The episodes so far have been gritty, logical, well written, directed, acted and edited. It has restored my faith in SF television. Well done to all involved in this project.",4 October 2017
1st season was watchable...not great but at least I slugged through it. Season 2 was much better but still everything was michael michael michael. Season 3 i had to Fast forward though 1/2 of it. So so terrible. Who is writing this trash?,9 December 2020
"Too many people on here live in the past and yet complain when the series does exactly that? This series has been brought bang up to date and I feel it is exciting and engaging to watch ! The characters do have depth and are likeable in their own way. The special effects are awesome and no expense has been spared and it's better for it in my opinion. This isn't the show from the 60's ! Which I loved by the way! It's better imo and I can't wait for the next episode. It's a new take and should be viewed as that, if you want the 60's vibe go and buy the dvd's And stop whining! I can't recommend this enough. 10/10 from me.",19 January 2019
"I really don't understand the hate for this show. Being early 30s I missed out on the origional Startrek but grew up watching TNG / DS9 / Voyager. While I'm sure that there are some inaccuracies which clearly upset die hard fans, the overarching story of season 1 was really great. The worst part of all the StarTrek I watched growing up was the monster of the week format week in, week out. (If you missed 3 and came back everything was the same.) This fixes that.",16 February 2019
"It is a series that keeps getting better and better with each episode. Battles are fast, confusing, with awesome effects... just how a real battle would be. Emotions and storyline are based on millenialls, not star trek purists. In the end, you have to admit that it is a really good Star Trek series, it is new and is trying to capture the audience of today. It could have used a few more known actors, but it will do. Purists should give it a chance and understand that it tries to do a mix between the original series and this century. As well, you have to understand the timeline and the fact that it is even before the original series. The principles of TNG for example were not really there. It took 100 and something more years for those to happen.",8 November 2017
"I've always loved Star Trek and still enjoy the older series. That being said, it's clear that many of the shows are dated now and things change for new audiences and to reflect the current global climate.

To make a series based on the old episodic format where the universe resets after each show doesn't really work these days and I think Star Trek Discovery does a good job to fit in with today's audience.

The main running story throughout the series is dark and engaging with a nice mix of drama and action plus it's unpredictable in places. The cast for the most part are on point so far and of course there are plenty of Easter eggs in there for us all to find too!

It clearly won't be for everyone as it is different to what many Trekkies are used to but I've really enjoyed the first half of this series. It's undeniably stunning and the characters are interesting. It's nice to have a show containing many complex characters that remain intriguing with plenty of back story to explore.

My advice to Trekkies old and new would be to give this a try but go in with an open mind, not expecting Kirk or Picard but expecting something new.",13 November 2017
"After so many episodes in so many versions of this universe. It's great to see this take. I don't want more of the same. I have seen every episode (and many more than once) of all the Star Trek series's, and in every series there was always one or two duds. This has been consistently good throughout and at times brilliant. Keep it coming.",17 January 2021
"Season 1 was promising. Season 2 was good. Season 3 is absolutely shocking. Poor writing, poor pace, woefully dull stories and this bizarre obsession with stereotype woke characters.

I have no idea why I keep watching it.",14 January 2021
"This show is slick and well thought out, you start to care for the crew and it manages to keep star trek at its heart whilst also bringing a sense of realism to it! Don't listen to all the hate on here just watch for yourselves!",28 January 2019
"Where do I begin...

At first I was very excited about the Start Trek revival, with todays CGI it had to be good. Wrong. Proof again that CGI cannot make up for poor stories, ridiculous acting, and side-stories which have no place in it.

The CGI is great for a show, the time-travel technology is interesting, and the spore drive, although almost mythological, and interesting concept. The acting of some character is good (Emperor, Ash, Pike, Lorca), but some characters such as Tilly, Michael, Owosekun (constant crying, behaving like children, irrational) are absolutely cringeworthy to watch. In addition, the amount of rainbow relationships and their disproportionally pushed romantic scenes are more than annoying. There is more drama with Stamets and Culber then in a dramatic movie. Obviously the inclusion is not the issue, but the spotlight is completely disproportional and clearly intentional.

This is not Star Trek, it is a rainbow space show for the snowflakes of the current generation (I say this, as being part of it).

Such a shame. It's a show I would be happy if it gets cancelled.",12 May 2021
Best Star Trek story yet. Thrilling from the first scene all the way through.,30 November 2019
It would appear that people either love this show or they hate it ! Having watched season one and most of season two I think that it is very good indeed. Sonequa Martin- Green is a very talented actress and excellent protagonist. The supporting cast are all very good and the writing first class as is the story line and effects. The one star drop is for mumbled dialogue at times. I am left wondering why so many people are giving this show a one star rating which it clearly doesn't deserve and which is born out by its success - a third season is in the offing. Race gender and sexuality may be an issue for some I suspect. And by the way the Klingons are subtitled.,12 January 2020
"So far so good but time slot is all wrong foolsball!! inter fears with the time and cuts half the show out if your trying to record it on DirecTv, needs to be moved to a different night if not I'm afraid people will miss out on a great show and it will be canceled before it has had a chance. CBS really needs to watch what time of the year and what night they start a new show or it will end up canceled because of sports cutting in and messing up the time slots.",28 September 2017
"Great storyline, great special effects, very engrossing. Gene Roddenberry would be very proud",6 January 2018
"Really enjoyed the first two episode. Its was a big brave & Dynamic change from the old Star Treks, but I think the program needed. Unfortunately the purists will not like this at all, hence the negative feedback. If they do not begin to embrace change, unfortunately they will never see a new episode of Star Trek in their life time.",26 September 2017
"Well, as a fan of the genre in general, the tv show in particular... I was so, so, glad by the end of season 1... enjoyed a lot, looked forward to more!

Ok I understand that every tv show as good seasons, and bad seasons.

But it's getting worse by the season.

But by the end of episode 2 of the fourth season... enough!!! I just pressed the stop button in revolt... almost vomit with the dialogs. Just couldnt watch it anymore... I just wanted to blow my brains!

Connection... connection... connection... no story line... just forced, lame, connection dialogs... It looked like the same lame dialogs on the last seasons of the walking dead. (wonder if theres any connection between the writers) just hateful.

I'm really disgusted by what they done to the tv show, because I love star trek... and they made me hate it!!!",9 December 2021
"I came in with very low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised. The visuals were good and the storyline was engaging. The only negative thing or 'nit-pick' is that the ships did seem very weak and fragile compared to the futuristic look. I guess the reason for this could be the pre-Kirk era but still seems unnatural never the less.",25 September 2017
"This is Trek, just a new iteration of it. So the characters have emotions, whoop whoop. If they didn't it would suck. This version of Trek is grittier and things are as polished which is how space travel should be. The inside a starship shouldn't look like the lounge deck of cruise ship. If you don't like it then don't watch it, take your dumb unfounded hate somewhere else while the rest of us enjoy the ride.",21 January 2021
Third season is way worse. It is painful to watch because of poor acting and below average writing.,20 December 2020
If you don't like it don't watch....I love this show stop hating.,24 January 2021
"It's sad to see how many long-time Star Trek fans blindly hate this show simply because it's not the exact same thing that we've always seen before. No doubt these are the same type of people who condemned Star Trek The Next Generation as unwatchable trash before it even came out because it didn't have Kirk and Spock.

Discovery has its faults, both internally and within the greater scheme of Star Trek. But overall the first season has been a better start than any other Trek series got--not that that's saying a lot since Trek shows have notoriously awful first seasons. But it's interesting, well plotted, and with a cast of interesting characters that leave it a lot of future potential.

While it's not approaching the level of either the historical best of Star Trek, or the more modern high quality SF of The Expanse, Discovery certainly has enough going for it that it's not just worth checking out, but worth giving some time to see how it develops.",30 September 2018
"I have now finished season 3, and I can say that I am satisfied with the show thus far. Discovery started out slow, but I feel it has found its stride, for better or for worse. I have been wanting a new Trek series from a while now.

Season 1 stated off slow and awkward. The characters did not seem to mesh well at times. There definitely seemed to be a growing period where the cast was trying to figure out who each character was going to be, and where they fit. As season one ended, I was ok with the series. I was not overly excited, but happy to have a Star Trek show to watch again.

As season 2 began, the bar was not set very high, so I did not have huge expectations. Through season 1, and now season 2, the show seemed to navigate through Trek canon. Some areas were better than others. Season two was exciting and I really enjoyed the fusion of characters from Treks of old with the new ones. It seemed to fit together nicely, in a surprising way. As other reviews mention, Discovery is a more 'emotional' in its story line and characters. It takes some getting used to, and I can understand if some viewers could not. Season two went from start to finish with no gaps in excitement. At its conclusions, season 2 left me craving to see what was going to be in store for season 3.

Season 3 did not disappoint. Now, the series no longer needs to deal with Trek canon, it is now able to finally set itself apart from other Trek series and movies. It can find its own way and the sky is the limit. I found the characters finally found their footing with their inter personal relationships and their place with in the show itself. There was still a lot of emotion spread around (I feel you get used to it). As good as the third season was, I did find it a bit obnoxious how 'wokeness' was throw in the viewers face from time to time. When one watches a show for entertainment, one does not need cultural or political lectures. With that being said, the third season was great. I am anxiously looking forward to season four.

Overall, Star Trek Discovery is a show worthy of watching for Trek and non-trek fans alike. Though it is slow to launch, what it lacks early on, it makes up for by the end of season three. It is an exciting, compelling, and fun series in all so far. I now have high hopes for the coming seasons.",29 January 2021
"I started watching DSC and I was a bit sceptical. Have to identify myself a bit. Grew up with TNG. The new effort of JJ found an ally on my face after years of disappointment (ST:DS9, Nemesis, ST:ENT etc). Now back to DSC again. The first season is rough and you'd better be prepared. It's dark and the Klingongs like we know them ... do not exist. Too much focus on Michael makes the whole scenario boring with amazing effects. The second is moving away from the story of Michael, with a new great captain (we know him from the recent trilogy). The crew is binding deeper and the characters seem more friendly to us. I strongly believe that those series will write history....",10 March 2019
"The show is getting better, as the second of of the season is now airing. Starting to remind me of voyager, in a different kind of way. I just view it as a different universe in the star trek universe. Problems solved. All this complaining doesn't make since to me. Was DS9 really ""Star Trek""? Not really, but it was still a good series in the Star Trek universe.",15 January 2018
"When I thought that Star Trek Discovery couldn't get worse I started watching the 4th Season. So disappointing.

If I could I wish I could give a rate of 0 Stars.

Do not lose your time watching it.",28 November 2021
"Woke, alternative lifestyle, body positive, feminist garbage. Even the female Klingon leader is part of the feminist propaganda in this Show.

The first season of this film is poorly written, poorly directed, and poorly executed. The mostly female bridge and leadership is the obvious result of appeasement for extreme feminists. The dialogue is slow and painful. The lead is supposed to be this exceptional, alien trained human who graduated top of the alien's class. Yet if you accept this impossibility, her grammar and mannerism is more aligned with someone who only did okay in their local community college, let alone an alien academy top-gun graduate. Not knocking community college. Just making an observation. She also is a horrible actor. She looks stiff and inauthentic in this role.

There is also a goofy, obese redhead who acts like a clown versus a Starfleet Officer. She would never pass the starfleet physical. But wokeness requires everyone to feel included no matter how far fetched. I just watched a scene where she gave an alien a ""pinky swear."" Her goofy character belongs in a sitcom with a laugh tract.

The episodes drag on with poorly written dialogue while the completely disjointed plot is rushed and scattered all over the place. Additionally, every film today seems as though it has to have a token gay couple, adding absolutely nothing to the story.

I understand there are times where a gay dynamic adds something to a film, versus distract from it. One that quickly comes to mind is the Jack Nicholson/Helen Hunt film, As Good as It Gets (1997). Unfortunately, these days Hollywood tosses in a token-homosexual for no reason whatsoever other than to check a PC box. By tossing tokens into poorly cast and poorly written roles they actually diminish real people. This is not a slur. It is a valid observation even if some find it uncomfortable, which is not my intention.

Klingons look like mutated Orks from The Five Armies. Their role in this film was also disjointed and lacked any sense of cohesiveness. Roger Rabbit could have played the Klingons' role just as effectively.

The ship's form of propulsion is far more advanced than any drive in any Star Trek series to include trans-warp drive, which again makes no sense. Their ship's pulsed-phasers is also out of sequence with the franchise time-line. Moreover, there is an episode with a holo-deck placing this time-line AFTER the original series, not before. It is as though the writers could not make up their minds where to place this series in the time-line. I suspect they failed to do their homework before making this installment. Also, I thought Vulcans do not lie. Unless I misunderstood a scene, it sure looked like a Vulcan told a whopper.

Some fight scenes were pretty cool. I even think I saw at least one double-fisted punch. However, the ""sexist"" in me can't buy into 110 lb women constantly beating the snot out of well-trained, 200+ lb men. I am also such a caveman, I still hold doors open for women. I know. I should be flogged.

Some of the sets and costumes were interesting. I'll give them that.

The very end of season one where they meet up with another star ship only serves to prove just how misaligned the technology in this installment is with the time-line of the franchise.

Finally, this series has some very dark undertones, further displaying the sick minds in Hollywood. I feel sorry for people who think the way they do in Hollywood. You can tell by today's films, including this one, just how sick and depraved they truly are.",28 December 2018
"Ok so I've been a fan of Discovery all through its first 2 seasons and eagerly awaited Season 3, delayed a bit because of COViD-19. So it's premier episode for season 3 finally came. Let me say one thing... WOW. A tremendously entertaining and attention-grabbing first episode. After thoroughly enjoying the first 2 seasons I am blown away by the start of the 3rd. The writers are amazing, the cinematography is excellent as always and the acting- absolutely believable and fantastic, as always. Watch this, if you're a Member of Gen X or a fan of any Star Trek series, then Discovery will enthrall you. As Michael Birnham, Sonequah is amazing as she has been for 2 seasons. If this first episode is any indication of the remaining episodes, then season 3 has raised the bar even higher, if that's possible after 2 smashingly successful seasons. 2 thumbs way up!!",20 October 2020
I'm not a huge trek fan but I really enjoyed the first 2 episodes i definitely will carry on with this I don't agree with the other reviews they seem harsh this is well done and well worth a look even for hard- core trek fans. I give it a 10 and look forward to seeing what the rest of the season will be like.,26 September 2017

"No, ST Discovery is not on a luxury liner like TNG or doesn't hit the audience with a moral lesson and whimsical epilogue every episode like TOS, but this is the 21st century and things are a little different now. Sadly, serial storytelling doesn't lend itself to those who want 20th century story telling and that seems to have miffed a lot of fans. Fortunately for those long time ST fans like myself, a lot of other new fans seem to be jumping on the bandwagon - just like new fans came on board with TNG while others refused to watch because it wasn't like TOS. I hear the show had 53 million fan expressions this past week. Can't wait until next week's show, even though the Super Bowl will be on.",31 January 2018

Watched for two seasons of what is not Star trek and is really badly written. Netflix stopped funding it for a reason. Plus it tries to rewrite star trek history and trash characters fans know and love.,6 April 2022
The writers are destroying the franchise. This has nothing to do with Star Trek anymore. We don't need a 4th season of this!,29 December 2020
"Still full of inclusion, science, and adventure but more action-packed than the original and subsequent series.

The production value, imaginative interpretations of new and old characters, and the balance between the episode-length plot arcs and the multi-episode plot arcs are all so satisfying.",12 October 2019
"I created an imdb account only to express my disgust to all these who rate this EPIC series with 1 or 2 stars! Damn get a life people...The rest of you who don't know what to think about it I tell you this: If there were not this closeminded people the real rating of the series would easily be above 8,5. See the series, it is totally worth it, I can't wait for new season!",16 June 2020
"Refreshing to have a new take on Trek. Shorter seasons with an arching storyline, what's not to like. Great to have a new Trek on the TV, minus the weird holodeck episodes.",6 April 2021
Don't know why there are so many bad reviews. I like it and i'm watching ST since i'm a child. Yes it's different to the old series but i was always waiting for the series which deals with the war between klingons and federation. Here it is. So far i like it can't wait for next week episode,25 September 2017
"I agree with those that have said this show started with promise, and has gotten progressively worse. I'm not going to finish season 4. I just don't care. I'd say we were watching the death of Star Trek but I've just caught up with season 2 of Picard and that, people, is how you do Star Trek.

Discovery is just - everywhere, all the time. It's a mess. It can't figure out what it wants to be so it tries a new bit each week. It's like ADHD on TV.

There's not a single character I care about. I can't name half the bridge crew. I don't know what planets the bridge crew come from, If one of them were to die - an epic episode in any other Trek series - would I care? Not really.

I'll probably rewatch the first 2 seasons to see if I really liked them. At this point, I have no idea.",30 March 2022
"Stop looking for Discovery to be the same Star Trek you grew up with, cause it's not going to be! Overall, this is a great show and personally I love the story and the direction it's going in",10 November 2020
"Not Star Trek any longer. It's a sappy and badly written commentary on social agendas. Star Trek always made some sideways comments on society, but this season is just over the top. Every other moment is oversaturated emotional garbage or some overt political commentary. The pundits on the news channels handle that. Star Trek should be good, exciting sci fi and not what it has become.",18 March 2022
"I love the show. It set up the show in the first episodes to play as a regular formula Star Trek show, then threw a plot twist that changed the whole nature of the show. A lot Trekkies will not like the more serious tone of the show, but the original Utopian description of Earth in the original show was a reaction to the Cold War and the seeming inevitability of World War III. That's not the case anymore, so there's no need for that. This show has real stakes and more 3 dimensional characters than previous outings. They also set the show up so that it can turn on a dime and throw any type of plot twist they want at the audience. The pay wall sucks, but it opens the door for them to have more creative freedom. Nothing can stay the same forever and survive, so I'm all for this new Trek.",19 October 2017
"This show took a little while to find it's feet, but it is great!",1 January 2021
"First of all.... Just scroll through these reviews, look at all the 1 star reviews and explain to me how it can possibly have a 7.5 out of 10. Does wokeness automatically give it a bonus 5 stars??? Bottom line is - you're either a progressive who gets excited about watching liberal propaganda - or you are everybody else, who doesn't understand how this can be called Star Trek, who is insulted by the heavy-handed melodrama, and who (speaking of heavy-handed) tuned in to watch a sci-fi show with relatable characters and ended up being spoon fed the angst of woke poster children teaching us lessons each episode from the Hollywood diversity handbook. At least when previous Trek shows dealt with diversity or sexism or progressive issues, they did it in an organic and INTERESTING way. Instead we just get speeches about which pronouns to use. Please cancel this show and start over. Your alienating your fan base. Pun intended. I find it humorous that they now expect people to SUBSCRIBE/PAY to watch this garbage.",19 November 2021
"The season 4 has become a psy-fi instead of a sci-fi. It deal with lots of psychological problem and every single scene has someone talking about a childhood issues or issues they dealt with earlier in life. I have watched all Star Trek series, all of them! And season 4 of Discovery is by far the worst possible season of all star trek series. This is a journey in space and is about science not a spiritual journey dealing with psychological issues. Sack the writers for this season! Please!!!",9 March 2022
"Each Star Trek is different than the original. Voyager was one long expansive journey home - with a Captain who was a woman. DS9 was for the most part, a self-contained journey of war and its aftermath, with a mostly alien crew and a black Captain. So, when people complain this isn't like other Star Trek series, that's okay.

This is a great series. Full stop.",31 May 2019
"To whomever, gave us every new STAR TREK series. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU.

Reuniting with the theme, tone, Idealism, realism, emotional connections of the series; that I watched as a child on into adulthood. Has been amazing. I feel reconnected to my past. Not Just to the ongoing series; but to many more forgotten memories. I feel like and orphan in this new world. The new Star Trek series has been a wonderful re-anchoring.",7 May 2022
"I'm picky about movies and television shows in general. My mindset is that I'm a busy person and I won't squander my free time on things not worth my while.

I've been a 'Trekkie' for decades and there have some shows and movies from the franchise I really liked and others I thought were lackluster. To be honest, I was expecting this new reboot to be a disappointment and something from Hollywood just using a loved cult classic to make a few bucks.

This new chapter in the Star Trek saga is really, REALLY good. Less like a typical television show and more like an epic series that's comprised of movie chapters. I'm currently through the fourth installment and it just seems to get better and better. The support staff of this series, from writing to directing to special effects to cinematography, really are trying to make this show the very best and it shows. Each episode oozes of a feeling that it's created by people who are uncompromising and are die-hard Trekkies themselves.

This new series is a bit more serious and cerebral than other prior works of the franchise. This might turn off some fans who liked shows infused with inside humor or action-packed story lines. It loosely reminds me of the 'brainy' the original Star Trek movie from the late 1970s but with just the right amount of excitement thrown into the mix. I just watched episode 4 it brought another dynamic to the show as it was a bit dark/creepy/horrific - reminiscent of some the Alien movies.

I really jazzed and eagerly await the next weekly installment. If you are a sci-fi lover who likes realistic, very well-written scripts with 'sets' and special effects that will immerse you that does away with mindless, 'formula', over-the-top excitement that has become common nowadays, this show is for you.

Love it.",4 October 2017
Season 3 starts off with a bang. What wonderful science fiction!!. Great acting and writing. Amazing FX and production. I am hooked!,21 October 2020
"The only thing about this show related to Star Trek is the mentioning of Star Fleet and a few vessel names. The rest of this show is just horribly written, acted, and filled with virtue signaling. If they keep this up, they'll successfully kill the franchise.

Completely unwatchable,",24 May 2022
Seems to be a lot of bot complaining about a woman in the lead and the inclusiveness of LGBTQI characters. Personally I think it reflects society we live in now so its good (and it's set in the 3000s). It's very different to other star treks but yet familiar. If you are open minded give it a try and judge for yourselves. I like it. First season a bit too violent but entertaining. Second season very geeky (YAY). Third season pretty good so far with an extra slice of cheese. (Then most Star Trek are a little cheesy! Which I love),8 November 2020
"The acting is so wrong, the ""science"" from sci-fi is almost missing. Everything is wrong. I do not know why do I keep watching this. Actually I do. For the name that it once was ""StarTrek"". Such a shame!!! Please revive this!!!",29 January 2022
"I was initially excited about this show, then apprehensive, now I'm excited again. To all that hate it, just stop watching and go away. I don't continue to watch and review things I hate! This show has obviously incredible graphics but where it is starting to shine is its story-line and character development. Its very intriguing and I cannot wait to see where they are going to go with it. For the first time in many years, I anxiously await every Sunday. Open your mind and you will be pleasantly surprised. And as a 52 year old man I have loved Star Trek my whole life. Every series had its negative aspects but overall they are simply great. You can keep your rip-offs like the juvenile Orville, this is Star Trek!",24 October 2017
"Binged S1 & S2 and am pleased. Good story, well acted and top notch production values. If you're a fan of Star Trek and what Gene Roddenberry envisioned, I think you'll enjoy it too. Highly recommend.",9 September 2020
I actually liked the show very much! It's not a family show like the other Star Treks.,27 January 2018
"If you are going to reboot the entire ST universe then be straight with us. This isn't in the 'PRIME' OR any other ST universe I know of. The klingons were pathetic, what is up with all that plastic on their heads? You wouldn't know they had an existing Klingon language with the way they were mumbling all their lines. The acting was bad bad bad, I could not believe how wooden and uninteresting they all were. Making a ST emblem in the desert...OK...how did the ship see it through the thick cloud cover? Idiots. Who wrote this crap, have they ever watched Star Trek or did they just catch a few mins of it on cable one night? I give it 3 stars only for the production values...they were pretty good.",27 September 2017
"I'm through listening to anyone who complains the technology in the prequel exceeds that of TOS. Just remember we've updated our own ""historical documents"" to the point that Jesus is white. I'm surprised the Thermians from the klaatu nebula haven't come to earth to explain this to Trekkies. Never give up! Never surrender!",12 January 2020
"Star Trek was getting boring and this one is making it cool again :) All the fans are giving very low points, but al the non fans are loving it... Some people have to let go of the past :) we love now and in the future ;)",23 January 2018
"I know there are a lot of negative reviews on season 3 of Discovery, but despite Burnham's whispering and the emotional intermezzos, this still is a very good show in my opinion. It grabs your attention, and does not let go. It still has everything Star Trek is all about: exploration, discovery, politics, dialogue, action, suspense, good and evil.

I am an all-time Star Trek fan (watching since TOS), and really love the fact that we're still able to enjoy new Trek content being made. I love discovery for what it is. I do not compare it to other series from the past. It has its own distinct character and atmosphere, and I thoroughly enjoy every minute of it.

I do concur with the opinion that Burnham should stop crying though :).",1 January 2021
"Sure, many Star Trek fans hate this. I get it. Everyone's entitled to have an opinion. But reading through the comments I've got the feeling that all the haters have been watching a completely different show than I have. Or maybe only the pilot, I don't know. Fact is: I experienced Discovery to be the first show of the franchise since Next Generation that moved me deeply. I came to love the crew as much as I loved Picard, Data and the rest of the bunch. And that's something I'm thankful for. Didn't think that was possible.

As much as Next Generation has been the perfect Star Trek for its time (End of the cold war) I think Discovery is perfect for the scary times we're living it right now (fear, racism, Trump, right wing parties on the rise everywhere). That's why it has to be darker, more brutal and overall scarier. But Discovery also shows us that there is a way out. And that's where the old Star Trek feeling kicks in. Hope, tolerance, curiosity and love are the forces that fuel characters like Burnham, Stamets and Tilly.

I love this show and I hope that it will be around for many seasons to come.",23 January 2018
"I was really looking forward to a new Star Trek franchise. The visuals and special effects are fantastic and the new gizmos and and species are cool if you can just put aside the continuity issues. I also like the diversity and inclusivity. What I can't stand is all the boo hoo emotional stuff. The United Federation of Planets is a diplomatic organization and the starships are military or at least para-military vessels, obviously analogous to naval vessels, and for good reason. They need to operate as systematic and organized entities even when far away or out of contact with central command authority. There is way too much debate. If you don't like the captain's decision then you had better have a proposal for a better course of action. And no crying! Also, when will they invent seatbelts in the Star Trek universe? At least the seats seem to be bolted down now.",1 January 2022
I don't understand why it's being reviewed poorly. I really liked this show. Just finished Season 2 and looking forward to season 3.,3 May 2020
"I've been a trek fan since watching reruns of the original series with my father in the early 70s. And I've enjoyed every franchise and spin-off since I started watching. I enjoyed season 1 of discovery. Season 2, something began to seep in that bothered me, and it began to fester and now has grown into a bit of disdain to the point I have to occupy myself while I'm watching it. The earliest example that stands out in my mind while I was watching it with a friend is a scene where Spok and Michael have this long-drawn-out conversation about their past regrets, love, and respect for each other as they are seconds away from each other the potential end of their universe. They have to execute things flawlessly for their efforts to save everything successfully. There is all this action going on around them in a heightened situation, and from my vantage point, this type of interaction would be a bit briefer and not so darn drawn out. To me, the show and writing are going out of their way to overly interject hyper exaggerated emotional dialogue that doesn't fit with the situation, time, and temp of what's going on around them. Some of it is necessary to further the storyline and hopefully bring viewers into investing in the characters. Season 4 has darn near lost me as a vested viewer. It has become almost soap opera-like in many cases deviating away from all the other Trek series so much it leaves me thinking at the end of each episode...God, I hope this gets better.",2 December 2021
Love it havent seen the original one but love the darknes and really Nice story lin,30 August 2020
"I'm by all means not a Trekkie, and I usually don't write reviews. But the Discovery is such a surprise for me, I had to drop a line or two. After my initial negative response in the first episode to the changes made (overall visuals - from costumes to the ship designs), from the second episode the show actually gets better with every next one. It's not a typical ST show, as in the whole season has a main storyline, which is actually a refreshment over the classic ST individual-story-per-episode recipe. The production values are pretty high, the animations are well above average for a TV show, and the pacing and directing along with acting are for almost the whole time spot on. My only actual criticism is for the title theme which is nowhere near Goldsmiths' and sound pretty generic. Also, Martin-Greens' character doesn't act very Vulcan-y, in almost all the time throughout the first season. The new Klingon looks are actually really good when you get used to them, as is their ships' interior design. Also, their Language feels integral to the visuals. Overall, it's a solid show, obviously made for the new generation of ST fans, with an interesting, although not always canon, storyline and enough action to keep both the old fans and new satisfied (in my opinion, of course). Especially since these days (2018.) there are no SF shows of the ""classic"" kind ('cept for example Orville, which is for another review).

Thoroughly enjoyed it. Give it a chance no holds barred.",25 April 2018
"Season 1 and 2 was amazing !!! Also I'm willing to watch the spin off ""Strange New Worlds"" !

But this last season was too much ! Too much cry, uncertainty and lack of strong characters and focus !

Any way I will keep investing on the series and I hope for a next season that they overcame this problems.",27 December 2020
"I couldnt finish ONE episode this season because how bad it is. its noticeable the show run out of money because every episode is a one scene rearenged props and cgi. the adventure part of exploring is missing. Michael is cringe, lousy, bad written.uncomfortable to watch. the others are just bad, worse, if possible: they got fat, tell the lines knowing they re bad writte. they feel its going nowhere. the ship is irrelevant in this trek. let it go. the suitable allarm: fade to black.",19 November 2020
The 2. Season was MUCH better than first. I'm just can't wait for the third! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,27 April 2019
"After watching Strange New Worlds and enjoying it. I gave ST Discovery another chance. I stopped watching it after mid 1st season. I can honestly say. Aside from some Pike episodes. I couldn't continue watching it. I couldn't care less if some of the characters died or not. Tilly is the worst character. There are some good episodes, but we skipped alot. Even my kids lost interest, and we are die hard Star Trek Fans. Can't believe Paramount still renews this. Let it die.",7 July 2022
"Brilliant! Exceptional Sci-Fi! Fast, Breathtaking, energy, great sci-fi, characters, spaceships, creatures - everything you want from big epic Space Opera. Marvellous! Can't wait for season 3. Hats off to the cast and crew for making a really great sci-fi show. Two seasons were utterly amazing. I was breathless several times throughout. Wonderful.

The look and feel of the worlds - space, the settings, the planets, the creatures - magnificent. If anything would love to see it run on the big screen or IMAX. Now that would be something special.

Highly recommended.

I am a big life long sci-fi fan, watched all sorts of shows etc. And this is way up there in the top 5 ever. Wonderful. Set to be a classic forever! Keep it going guys !",30 June 2020

All the doomsayers , get a grip.

Move with the times, fast paced, great characters , awesome cgi.

TREK FOR THE FUTURE. Get out of the 60's peeps.",13 August 2021
"Why are all the reviews so negative? Sure, it may not be as fluffy or ""traditional"" as the others but do you blame the writers for going down this road since the last attempt was Scott Bacula's abortion which killed the Star Trek brand for over 10 years.

This was by far the best space based sci fi series released in a very long time. I was thoroughly entertained",27 September 2017
"I really enjoyed the first couple of seasons. It was probably the darkest version of the Star Trek TV shows I have ever watched. The characters were bad to the bone. The CGI in this show is fantastic to me. I believe there is a lot of money spent on this and it surpasses even newer movies. I would rate the first two seasons of this show an 8/10. Season 03 started to get a little iffy for me. The characters seem to have forgotten how badass they are including the strong women in this show. Season 04 has flipped 180 from the first couple of seasons. The show is no longer dark, we seem to be focusing on relationship more than actual science fiction. Not every show on TV needs to be ""woke"". I never watched Star Trek because I wanted to know more about Kirk or Picard's love stories. I feel like I am now watching a soap opera in space. I am not against LGTB or women empowerment by any means but I do not watch science fiction because I want to learn more about the relationships of characters. Congrats on ruining a great show, you gained the LGTB movement, lost women empowerment, and added the exploration of horrible relationships that no one asked for.",15 December 2021
"Just finished the last episode of the dorst season. So here it is: slow start, after episodes 4-5 it hits off. Storyline not as thight as the older series, Some unlikely events, but a strong arc capturing the season. a lot of trekkies are burning the series and in my opinion they are missing out on something. This is not classical star trek but its good. Looking forward to next season!",20 March 2018
Great show! It is joyfull to watch each episodes. Can't wait till next one to watch new stuff.,14 December 2020
It just keeps getting better and better! I'm grateful we have quality Star Trek alive and well!,23 March 2019
"All previous reviews miss the point. This is Star Trek, not high school musical, not college American theater class. The point is entertainment, and this was entertaining. If you watch every show to gauge the plot, allegiance to previous Star Trek shows, judge costumes, acting, line delivery, camera sprites, etc, you have other problems in your life that require a little introspection away from TV.

Pop up some popcorn, grab your favorite drink and enjoy!",25 September 2017
"I have been a fan of Star Trek for many years, i have just starting watching the new series of Star Trek, Discovery is in a nut shell INCREDIBLE, a highly well thought out voyage through the stars, beautiful Visual effects and excellent acting, it delves in to the lives of these Star fleet officers in a truly opposite view to what we all were use to with the classic trek... i for one really enjoy where they are going with this, if you want action, fx and joy ride to the stars this is for you, if you want to watch the Old series then go right ahead....STAR TREK LIVES ON!!!!",24 October 2017
"I am actually glad Gene Roddenberry is dead so he did not have to see this abomination. Well if he was alive he would not have allowed this awful show to move forward.

"I really enjoyed seasons 1 and 2, season 3 wasn't so good and season 4 is nothing but liberal, box ticking drivel. It would appear that the writers at the end of season 2 were instructed to remind us that even in space, there are minorities who must be pandered to. Too much touchy feely emotonal rubbish and not nealry enough action, which is a shame, because this show had potential.",11 July 2022
"I really cant understand why the fanatical purists of the series are giving such bad reviews for this series. Or did I just answer my own question?

I love the show. Its set 10 year before the original star trek. But that does not mean that they have to sit in a cardboard box and pretend shake every time a torpedo hits.

I love the characters. Michael Burnham is a doing a great job. And watching the series from the view point of someone who isn't captain, shows us so much more of the underbelly of the series and I feel, its much more captivating.

And two stories actually. One of Michael Burnham and one of the Klingon Voq.

Very very interesting, watchable and fun.",10 October 2017
The new Trek crew has life. The plots have my locked into each episode. I have been a fan of Star Trek since I was a young man and have enjoyed every show with the exception of Enterprise. This had now taken the place of Voyager as my second favorite behind the original series.,12 February 2019
"The series is SIMPLY TOP, THE BEST OF ALL THAT I EVER WATCHED!!! Sonequa Martin-Green is very beautiful in this role! The series is cool! Good plot, very addictive! I watched in one breath!! I advise everyone!!! This series helps me every day to go forward and achieve new goals! Many thanks to the creators of this series! I would also like to add that I am writing this review in a rage. Can you explain to me how you can be such a beast to call such a wonderful series like this? (I'm saying about those who wrote terrible reviews.) It's just not comprehensible to the mind. Everyone's gone crazy! Well, except for those who liked this show!)",23 October 2020
I've somehow got through three seasons. Each year gets harder to stick with. Terrible writing and simple characters make this show an embarrassment to the franchise.,15 January 2021
"Please ignore all bad reviews and watch it yourself and make up your own mind. If you compare this to deep space nine or voyager then this beats them hands down. I have always been a Trekkie, although just watching not a super fan by any stretch, and I believe this has the potential to be the best series of all. Huge claim I know and it has only just started, time will tell. Certainly the most adult of all Star Trek franchises (cant watch it with my 8 year old daughter that's for sure) but I believe its stronger for it. Hope this goes on for many years",28 January 2018
"I've read a bunch of reviews for STD, and noticed that most of the reviewers who love STD, insult and denigrate people who don't. As you read the reviews, some people layout out their criticisms very clearly. I'm just going to give general impressions.

I love Sci-Fi. I started with the original Star Trek in 1968, and have watched all the Star Treks, Stargates, Babylon 5 and most of the rest. Usually there is some overall theme or plot direction for the season. STD seems to wander all over the place. Every episode, it looks like they are taking the series some other direction. Not like a plot twist, but like the show runner keeps changing.

I like a series, Sci-Fi or not, with some likeable characters. STD doesn't seem to have any. The characters run from sadistic to simple-minded, but none of them seem like people you know. They have no depth or sides to their personality. And the dominant demeanor is unbridled emotionalism, but never joy or wonder, always dark. And forget wit or humor.

If you like Star Trek, try Orville. That is a little campy, but Star Trek plots with people acting like humans.",23 March 2018
"I am absolutely dumbfounded how some idiots reviewed this series poorly after a few amazing episodes. The quality of the cinematography and cgi is on par with the current movie reboots. The characters are great. The plot is riveting and the introduction to the Klingons is just fierce.

I'm a little bit concerned about the 'spore drive' potentially being way off canon. It's a pretty weird choice considering its fate is already sealed considering the time setting of Discovery.",14 October 2017
"Just ignore self proclaimed guardians of Star Trek who completely miss the point like all fundamentalists do and fanatically down rate the new series.

Like past iterations, it takes a while to get used to. Have an open mind and enjoy the show, you'll soon see that the action packed first episode will just set up the wider context for the show and the episodes that follow will be highly entertaining in more typical Star Trek way. You'll find yourself starting to care about the characters and eagerly awaiting and anticipating their next move, trying to understand them better and their motives.

Naturally, it will take a while to completely fall in love with it, just like other Star Trek series. Ignore naysayers, give the show an honest chance and you'll begin to love it soon enough.",14 October 2017
"I watched the very first Star Trek in 1966 when it first premiered (I was 7) and I've been a fan ever since. I know that some fans don't like to see the Star Trek landscape evolve, but that's the essence of what this is about. It's always challenging what our views of the future can be. If it's not something unexpected, then what's the point?

Some of the Discovery storyline is complex, but I love the characters. I'm so glad to see gay relationships highlighted, leading black and minority characters (Sonequa Martin-Green is amazing), and Tig Notaro really gives it a boost. As a tekkie, I could take issue with the scientific reality of some of the time travel scenarios, but I'd rather just be entertained by all the work that has gone in to making enjoyable entertainment that highlights our humanity in the end.",28 April 2023
"I have been a long time fan of Star Trek, ever since my childhood. This show is riveting, timely, and pulls absolutely no punches. The acting is phenomenal (MICHELLE YEOH!) and visual effects stunning. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys Star Trek's other franchises, but be warned, it has an aura all its own. Every episode I was more and more impressed with the storytelling. CBS outdid themselves here and I can't wait for the next season.",6 August 2020
"The storyline is ok but the characters are so bad. To add to this mediocrity of a show, it is a platform for Woke and LGBT propaganda.",12 October 2021

"Few new ideeas, a lot of old ideeas. The end is booring, too sentimental. Why so many good looking men in this series and so NOT good looking women???",4 September 2020
"If you loved Star Trek you are going to hate this. Everyone here is judging this series by its past. Well I did not like the past so I feel very pleased to see the present as it is much better than what we've seen in the earlier series. I know, I know. I am the guy who prefers the newer Star Wars over the old, the new Alien movies over the old ones. (Same with ST movies.)

I'd love to give 11 points out of 10. On its own this is going to be a wonderful show. In the shadow of it's past and Star Trek purist core fans this well... not so much.

Honestly guys: You were expecting something different than you got in the new movies? I believe that to satisfy a Star Trek fan you'd have to dig up the 1980's equipment from the basement (along with the actors and writers). I see these guys as old grumpy veterans shaking their walking sticks saying ""Back in my time..."" all the time. Boring.

Remember this is written after the first two episodes.",27 September 2017
I felt compelled to say something in response to some of the extremely negative comments about this series. Netflix should be encouraged to make more in this genre. As far as I can see it's true to the Star Trek 'universe' and has introduced lots of new species/context/info/characters. There's nothing about this that goes against Gene R's original ideas. If still alive I am confident the man would be proud that we are still making iterations of his creation. Like I said production companies should be encouraged to invest in this category to continue inspiring both this and 'the next generation'.,8 February 2019
"I'm not quite sure what's worse. All the crying, Michael Burnham and her head tilts and whisper dialogue, the useless story line. Certainly the worst Star Trek show to date.",12 January 2021
"To compare this Star Trek series to any previous one is extremely difficult because this new show is very little like any of the previous shows. Now, instead of a one hour story that occasionally lasted several episodes, the show is essentially one long story...much like a soap opera or movie serial. Because of that, it's a tough show to watch here and there and it demands your attention each episode...something some viewers would no doubt not like. Additionally, the show is much darker and after the first half of season one, there is NOTHING that even remotely looks like comedy or even light drama. No, it's oppressive, dark and dim. On the positive side, it IS great looking...with effects that look as good as movies. But, Star Trek purists will no doubt be offended because this series is supposed to take place a decade before the first series from 1966-1969....yet the effects and technology seem hundreds of years ahead! Overall, it's a real mixed bag and I still honestly don't know what I think about it. Hard to rate and perhaps I'll come back to this review after I see more of how the story unfolds.

UPDATE: After finishing the first season, I found I didn't hate nor love the series BUT feel it's best not to try comparing it to other Trek shows...it's THAT different. Instead, just accept it for what it is....and you'll likely enjoy it more.",15 November 2017
It's worth enduring season 1's lacklustre effort for what is the best season of star trek I can remember. Was absolutely captivated.,28 April 2019
"What is wrong with you people, why so much hate for this series? In my opinion is very good and I am sure that it will surprise you as more episodes will be available. So what it is different than the other series and maybe it's non canon ,everything evolves, it's only natural. You shoud be more open about new things and if you'll give this series a chance I' m convinced that you will enjoy it.",30 September 2017

"This is not Star Trek, not even close. The show is full of woke BS. It will make you absolutely sick to your stomach to watch. Gene Roddenberry is rolling over in his grave.",24 March 2022
Love the concept of exploring more history leading up to the franchise as we know it. The current story line is offering an amazing perspective on some of the events that may have happened before Kirk. Hard to believe this is supposed to be only 10 years before Kirk's Enterprise so I am looking forward to seeing how they marry up the stories into the original series. Really like this version of Klingons. I personally think this is the best look for Klingons to date.,23 January 2018
"Star trek has lost its way. Every seasons gets worse and worse. Seems to be written by a bunch of kids poisoned by woke culture. Star Trek has turned into the borg, seeking to assimilate everyone, instead of being a cool sci fi show that tells exciting stories full of wonder, it turned into a politically flavored drama full of woke nonsense and bad emo drama. You won't identify with or feel for the characters. They aren't well defined. Its boring.",13 February 2022
"Sci fi gets no better than this, intellectual interesting characters and great plot lines to boot, forget the weird stuff about the flying saucers looking different and the aliens looking different it's a cracking bit of sci fi, hope they have another series in the offing, if not we can all live long and prosper in the Knowlege that some genres have to evolve and devolve for the new generation of watchers. Hold on to your hats ladies and gents it's a rollercoaster of a ride, I didn't want to get off. Series 3 pls x",27 May 2019
I absolutely love this show. I love the fact that the main protagonist is not a captain. It gives the audience a nice different perspective. The show keeps me on the edge of my seat the whole time. It could be a little more science fictiony but over all it's great! I love the set design as well as the graphics! Beautiful! I also was a huge fan of TNG and the movies!,6 March 2019
"I'm mainly writing this review as a response to all the bad reviews I just read here. Its an enjoyable series to watch and that's what it was meant to be.

The original Star Trek was creative and fun, Shatner was an awful actor really but made the part his own, a lot of the character interplay was corny but you got used to it. Patrick Stewart hammed the hell out the role, again having some fun.

If you don't enjoy it OK but it sounds like many are setting out to not enjoy it",16 October 2017
"Full disclosure, I've muddled through DS9 and TNG but never really saw them as continuations of TOS. For good or for bad, there is not much to compare with a Captain in one series sleeping and fighting his way around the universe with one whose drinks Earl Grey in his 'Ready Room'.

So when one reviewer says there was 'no action' in the Star Trek franchise, they are probably thinking of Deanna Troy psychoanalyzing an alien rather than Captain Kirk 'kicking the tar out of Finnigan'

Discovery is not perfect but it is definitely worth watching if your are a TOS fan. The science is believable and interesting (athough it made for a slow first couple episodes) and the characters are developing well.

Good effort for what they tried to achieve in the first season. Looking forward to the second.",9 April 2018
"I really loved this show, even being blasted into the futures future didn't feel awkward and then came season 4...4 episodes in and Holy Kirk it's awful. Wokeness rules, the main antagonist appears to be nothing more than an angry space shimmer and everyone is sharing their 'feelings' (or not, depending which storyline the actors have).

I really hope Strange New Worlds gets the world of Trek back on track because Discovery has me fully disengaged!",9 December 2021
"I have never watched the original Star Trek series. I started with the movies and am now watching this series. I am a huge sci-fi fan and I have been looking for a good sci-fi series to jump into. Star Trek Discovery has not disappointed. I find it extremely entertaining and fulfilling. It is very immersive and I am enjoying the universe.

My advice to anyone thinking about watching is to disregard reviews from Star Trek fan boys who are looking for a reboot of the old series. Its 2017. This series is fresh and entertaining. Give it a chance. If you are a sci-fi fan, you cannot go wrong with this series.",9 October 2017
"Season one is dark and gritty, with a well thought out story. It is what you would expect from various cultures clashing. It felt more aligned with the recent movies with Chris Pine.

By season four we have morphed to group hugs; we can solve everything if we just understand each other and talk it out. That's working out so well with Russia and Ukraine, it's not a realistic expectation when various races and cultures mix. Warrior societies do not mesh well with pacifist. There are always going to be ideological clashes that leads to conflict.

I love Tig Notaro character, she feels real.

I preferred Sonequa Martin-Green with short hair. I hate that her character has become so soft.",20 March 2022
"Same as picard it's new and bold version of strar trek. It can't be the same, it has to grow and crying of happiness every time a new episode of season 3 is coming out. The best so far. It had ups and downs of being ""much to different"". But now I feel it's getting back on track again. Keep it up",13 December 2020
"This is quite a decent series, i deserves a clear 8 for its general quality level. The reason for the bad reviews is people expecting it to be something else. And that's it, it's far far far far better than the tons of bad reviews would say. That is has crawled to such a respectable rating despite disappointing old star trek fans only shows how good is is - it would probably crawl to 8.4 or similar if there werent dissatisfied fans that want it to be something else.

However, someone like me i am not a fan of old star trek - so i am one of those who prefer a more generic fantasy than the old star trek which directly turned me off as being cringe/Lame/weird and never understood how so many loved it.

So yea, this is actually a high quality series from the 1 season i watched so far, but being that it has disappointed fans for going in another direction is the only reason you see so much hate in reviews.

Also what people say in their posts is nonsense - let me tell you its just an emotional rejection coz disappointment. It's not logical. So maybe just think this as an alternative story using the star trek universe setting but don't expect it to be like the good old star trek you remember. And it is modern as well which means story takes a hit, but graphics are great.",16 October 2020
"High octane and just when you think you know what's going to happen, there's a real twist. Anyone who doesn't like predictable shows will like this.",7 November 2020
"Seriously season 3 is great, really different stories and settings from any other Star Trek. Who said there is a ST cookie cutter? Love all the characters and can't wait for new episodes each week. I usually watch an original episode after each Discovery one, pure joy. You guys need to lighten up and enjoy.",12 November 2020
I've seen 13 episodes of STD so far and I'm done. It's horrible. I would rather watch TOS Spock's Brain 13 times in a row than to watch any more of this garbage!,12 February 2018
"This continues the tradition of Star Trek and ideals of Gene Roddenberry while telling very different stories. Having a show that is primarily from the perspective of someone who isn't the captain is innovative. Season 3 is science fiction at its peak: using stories of a speculative future to address the dilemmas of today.

The LGBTQ representation in the series is the next logical step in Roddenberry's vision of an inclusive and progressive future. It also brings realism to the franchise in an important area.

The acting is superb. The writing is quite good. The special effects are as thoughtful as they are beautiful.

Noble ideals are a rarity on TV these days. Disco brings it.",14 November 2020
"I loved this show for the first three seasons but now, not so much. Discovery is starting to get much too preachy and heavy on the long dialog sequences. I am by no means a person who dislikes a lesson in how to properly treat people or discuss feelings, when a show becomes only about that though it gets depressing. Discovery is being dragged down by one depressing, boring and LONG speech after another. Star Trek is about fun, light hearted and progressive exploration. While Discovery has made great improvements in progression the rest has turned into nothing more than Greys Anatomy or This is Us in outer space. I don't watch Star Trek for sad drama space soap opera, I watch it for fun science fiction. I may give up on the show if it doesn't lighten up soon.",17 December 2021
"I think this one appeals to the ""new"" Star Trek fans and not the people that are already deeply rooted in the previous iterations of Star Trek. While my all time favourite is TNG, I have to say that this one is probably what Enterprise should have been. I love the special effects, I like that they are trying to create a story and I would love to see more space battles. Shields up and enjoy watching! :)",16 January 2018
"For me, Star Trek: Discovery is as exciting as Star Trek: The Next Generation was back in the 90's. It isn't a copy, that would be boring, and it is something new, which is what we want. The first series was excellent, couldn't wait for each next episode. Great development of characters and fantastic story arcs. The second series has also not disapointed, just watched the penultimate episode, and it was awesome. Can't wait for the final. Avoiding spoilers, what they seem to be setting up for season 3, (as long as Netflix don't cancel it, and if they do, I'll be cancelling Netflix) looks to be really interesting and very cool.",13 April 2019

It address social norms and standards it addresses hatred, which it's getting plenty of. It fits in the timeline just fine obviously the discovery was a ship that was created well ahead of its time and that there could only be one because it should've never tried to be replicated due to its ability.

"Discovery has not been received well. No doubt.

It has diverged greatly from what everyone expected. No doubt.

But it offered something different that has long been missing from the star trek franchise.

Action. Modern special effects. A diverse cast and characters that more reflect the age we live in than TOS, TNG, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise and also Picard delivered and whilst those shows are classic, if you only compare them to what was, you'll potentially miss out on what is a compelling story and group of characters.

Everyone complains about Michael being able to everything. She graduated on Vulcan with the possibility to potentially enter the Vulcan science academy. Clearly, not an idiot.

"I grew up watching all the series of Star Trek. They were all avantgarde: one of the first multicultural shows; it had a positive vision; one of the first leading black actresses (Nichelle Nichols); Subtle, tasteful commentary on current events.

This series does not fit the mold of Star Trek. It absolutely has no humor!, There is only one consolation, and that is "" Jett Reno"" played by ""Tig"", Mathilde O'Coallaghan. She does a great job and, unfortunately, there is very little of her on the show. Discovery is just one emotional problem after another. I do not know who these writers are, but they do not follow the theme created by Gene Roddenberry. The original, next generation, DS9, voyager and even enterprise were all funny, light hearted, well written and memorable. They developed characters with good friendships that kidded and poked at each other. I may be wrong, but do not remember anyone laughing on the Discovery. .

Discovery is just a show that is trying to check all the boxes, multiple times!! It is so ""woke"" it will never go to sleep! Like I said, i am not against subtle, tasteful, professional social commentary. These writers focused on ""wokeness"" so much that they forgot the true meaning of Star Trek. They lost the entertainment factor and humor. They just made a late night soap opera that is just not watchable. It is filled with characters that have some emotional problem after another. They do not have fun and laugh and poke fun at each other. I guess they do not want to promote bullying (LOL).

There are no memorable characters. I can list countless characters that come to mind from all the shows: Kirk, Bones, Ohura, Spock, Sarek,, Scotty, Checov, Sulu, Harry Mudd, Nurse Chapel, Picard, Q, Q, Q and more Q, Riker, LaForge, Worf, Data, Troi, Lwaxana, O'brien, Sisco, Dax, Odo, Quark, MORN, Crusher, Guinan, Martak, Bashir, Grand Nagus, Janeway (what a leader), Nine, Kes, Chakotay, The doctor, Nelix, Paris, Barclay (broccoli), Torres, and on and on.

There are some fantastic episodes from the previous series that are emotional, or humorous that were incredibly well written that makes them unforgettable. There are quotes that are still used today from these shows because they were impactful and memorable. ""Discovery"" does not maintain that ability.

I gave Discovery a chance for four seasons, but I cannot bear it any more.

Can anyone see a Star Trek convention that features the characters from Discovery? I don't? I guess, this is one measure of Star Trek worthiness.

Sadly, it has even made me lose interest in ""Picard"", and forget about the ""new"" series coming in May. Too bad.",18 March 2022
"As a deep rooted Star Trek fan of serial watcher/re-watcher of ALL series (TOS, TNG, DS9, VOY and ENT) I find this new show entertaining and fulfilling in that it is illuminating another chapter of the Star Trek Universe.

"I should start by stating that my knowledge of the Star Trek universe is limited to 3 movies and some scattered episodes of Next Generation and Enterprise. That said, I must admit I rather enjoyed Discovery: interesting characters and plot (enough to keep me engaged during the 15 episodes), and very nice visuals. If it's to the previous series' standards or even consistent with their content, I do not know, but I do know that it was nicely done and entertaining.",18 March 2018
"I am a ST fan and have been for a long long time. I enjoy the science fiction and the adventure side of all ST.

"Looking at all these reviews for this gem of a show is disappointing. More of the fact, Star Trek was a show about coexistence from the get go, but many reviewers complained when they learned the main character was black. THATS THE SAD REASON FOR THE BAD REVIEWS!",19 September 2021
The time jump really puts the show in new territory and gives the show a feeling it hasn't had since the original series. Last season - I enjoyed seeing the Pike crew of the Enterprise. The Anson Mount Pike now is my favorite version and we are thrilled here that he will continue in the role in Strange New Worlds. I think the first season was the weakest one - and the hardest one to excuse with its liberties taken with trek canon. But it's gotten better ever since.,28 November 2020
Great series! Ideal for people looking for a futuristic space TV series experience.,20 November 2019
"I just can't believe that there is so much hate for this show :(

I as many others love Star Trek I love TNG Watched the whole series plus all movies and Voyager and all of the TOS movies. I know many think i'ts bad because it's not so much about exploration.

But this series is soo good! Every episode holds the visuals and quality of a movie, I love the idea of this series, the characters are solid, I also thought the series would be some what bad because of the focus of one character buts its not i promise.

The visuals are amazing for a tv show, the story is very exiting and me and my father cant wait to the next episode, there are so many awesome plot twist that you will love especially in episode 12.

I mean if you love Star Trek and then hate this show you are not a true fan, you must realise that you can not make a TNG again, the show wants new viewers not just all the kids from the 80s who are in there 40s and 50s now.

Just give the show a chance and don't expect it to be as TOS or TNG, expect it as Star Trek with a new view forward.

Personally I love this show and watch every episode on the cinema screen we have at home then you really get the feeling of every episode being a movie of it's own.

So please stop hating and grow up for once and just give it a chance and then if you don't like it then you can hate all you want.",23 January 2018
"Season 4 is so bad, I stopped watching.

Every character has to talk about their feelings at every single moment. Even the ships computer is emotionally unstable. Absolutely cringe worthy.

They desperatly trying to create an all inclusive atmosphere, everybody wants to be seen and express their deepest feelings at the most awkward moments. Even when the ship is about to explode, they first have to express their deepest emotions and ofcourse everyone fully understands.",23 June 2022

"This may not be exactly like the old Star Trek, I admit that it is quite dark and at first the acting was a little off?... But as you progress through the series the story is still very, very good. It is funny at times with solid character development. Add to that, it has been done extremely well. For me it captures what I've always loved about Star Trek and has progressed to a modern series.

I didn't have the luxury growing up of watching and following every single episode of the previous series (living in South Africa made that an near impossibility). But I watched every episode I could and loved every moment of it. I don't necessarily have all the background knowledge some of the hardcore fans have but I'm pretty sure this will become a new generations' favorite.",14 November 2017

"Since when does the captain of a space ship with the responsibility to fly across the Galaxy and the safety of the crew etc., has time to discuss about moral values to a person having an emotional break down because of issues from his past? This is a space ship paid by hardworking taxpayers living on planet earth, that would expect the same quality of employees like they would on an aircraft carrier or any other military outfit for that matter.

Also since when did the minimum requirements to have a healthy weight and a strong mental state was not necessary anymore? Aren't they risking the safety of the whole crew and mission by having people on board with psychological breakdowns? NASA astronauts train for years with the same people before they are approved to fly on a mission to space, because they have to make sure that they'll fulfill their duties without any mental health issues getting in the way.

I mean I'm watching this episode where you see a full grown man crying in front of the female captain about something that is completely disconnected with the job at hand and this overweight woman that talks to herself and crying half of the time. This is what you call la crème de la crème candidate that you would consider having at your team, on a long term trip across the Universe on a space ship with limited living conditions and very strict rules to follow?? I know it's a TV show but these basic protocols are well known by most people and the fact that they aren't applied and completely ignored on this TV series, becomes a distraction that you have to un-program your brain if you want to appreciate the series. Unfortunately I've not been able to do it, I finally lost interest, I couldn't connect with the series. They mine as well had taken the whole cast of the General Hospital tv series and replace the crew of the space ship and probably would've have been better. Stop this nonsense and get back to the basics and stop complicating the show with morality and stick with providing a moment of adventure to your audience like the first and second Star Trek series.",6 March 2021

"First couple of seasons were great but season 4 is a Bummer Trek. Slow, plodding, depressing story lines punctuated with long, life sucking soliloquies.

"Star Trek was in crisis. All the stories seemed to have been told. Kirk, Picard, Janeway, Sisko, Archer. They all accompanied us. In their very own way. Whoever criticizes today that the spirit of Star Trek has faded away, has in truth not listened. Star Trek is changing, just like the people here on Earth. New challenges are ahead of us. So do the new opportunities of our time. It's time to let them show us where we as humanity are meant to go. Perhaps this will no longer happen with weekly completed episodes, but with long adventures and stories about self-love. I think that's what we need today.",1 January 2022

"This is not Star Trek for the hardcore fans. This is modern SciFi, with all the right elements. After twelve episodes, it's obvious to me that this series is so much better than the rest. Never have I been this entertained by the former classic series. All of the former Star Treks are stuck in the same format, except for maybe Voyager. It's all about exploring, finding new species and uphold ideals, question social norms and all this gibberish in between. Sure, it's interesting and I love the characters. But the outcome usually has more happy ends than Disney ever made. It's simply very polished and free from feeling realistic in any way. I have swallowed a lot of flaws including the technical mumbo jumbo. It's what you do if you like SciFi. It's not realistic, and you know it. Well, at least Voyager took a small step out of the frame, and incorporated a more desperate approach. I really liked that franchise. Enterprise also didn't have the same happy formula as the former, but did nothing to make the brand Star Trek to feel fresh enough. But now we have Discovery. Thanks to Bryan Fuller och Alex Kurtzman for not listening to the fans. You found your own way and did something very fresh. I have seen the story unfold, and already the first two episodes had more changes than any precursor. I am used to that nothing ever happens; the captain remains the same, and characters takes years to develope. I won't include any spoilers but let's just say, things have changed. Dramatically. Here's a speed in development that no former producer ever would allow. Roddenberry may have been a genius, but I think he rests fine in his grave. The characters are very well done and performed. Just watching Sonequa Martin-Green embrace her character is a joy, and Jason Isaacs could be the best damn actor I ever seen in this series. I am also very fond of Doug Jones' Saru. I think it's a fabulous character. There are more to say but it can reveal too much. All in all, this series has characters who reminds about the classic ones. It's just more realistic. I never really felt much for the Klingons in the past, but even them are more realistic and more intriguing. The best thing about this serie is it's fast pace, how the story unfolds, and offer us plenty of surprices. Near the end of first season, the twist is so big, my mind is totally blown. How clever isn't this script? I say mindblowing. By far the most interesting, most realistic and most modern franchise of Star Trek ever done. Fans of the old classics, there is The Orville. Don't whine about it here, just walk away. I am going to watch both. The Orville is fun. it's just one feels like light entertainment and the other feels like the real stuff. 10/10, no doubt.",26 January 2018
Do not listen to any other review. They are all wrong. Very wrong. Very very wrong. Show is awesome. That includes every season. What is wrong with these people. They just don't like it cuz it's not the original series. News flash people. It's not the 60s anymore. Great show. Great acting. Great action. Great characters. I don't know what else to say. Oh well. Here goes. These reviews are very wrong. These people need there heads examined. The show is as good as the original. Maybe better. Can't believe it took me this long to watch.

"OK, new/old show, trying to ride the coattails of the Star Trek industry. Right off the top I'm tired of Klingons, real tired. Toss in a violent alien and toss out the real story of exploring the Universe and all its glory. But Klingons, yessss, must have Klingons. Ugly ones. Big ones. Inarticulate too. Especially the slow way they talk and yet the subtitles make them sound like they're speaking the Gettysburg Address. And haven't these guys ever heard of orthodontics?

But aside from that, why focus on conflict when in the fifty years since Kirk was flying around astronomers have discovered true marvels, unknown and unexplainable features of the universe? Aim for the stars Star Trek writers and get out of the violence for violence's sake loop.

"I have seen few Start Treks series and this one is absolutely amazing. Both plot and execution are great, acting always on the spot and very StarTrekish. Can't express myself enough on how much I have enjoyed watching it, waiting week after week for next episode.

Bring on season 2!!!!",8 January 2019
"Love the Spock on the discovery, i dont care really if the story matches up, alternative universe anyone - I just want more of this show, and i hope Spock can be a part of the crew.",30 March 2019
"This is my second time reviewing this ridiculous TV show. I quoted a lot of the racism and sexism used in this TV show along with how the cast bent knew just like the NFL did and even has ""locking arms"" referenced in a scene. To sum this show up, it is left leaning politics with very unlikable characters riding around in space ships that are suppose to be 10 years pre-Kirk, but look newer and more sophisticated than Star Trek TNG.

If you want to watch politics, watch this and the news, if you want to be entertained, find something else.",3 October 2017
"I like this show . It has good visuals , good story line, good acting and blend of science fiction and Drama. What i like about this show is that it not just keeps showing new problems and its solutions like other science fiction shows but also shows the psychological and emotional side of characters and their investment as a living breathing organism towards their environment and situation. I read other reviews only to find out that emotional scenes are upsetting many viewers . They are sick of Burnham crying but they should also consider the fact that however advance science and technology becomes humans cannot stop caring.",27 November 2020
"New kids on the block with no respect for 50 years of a cultural icon. Roddenberry would not have approved of the Klingon makeover, nor of the destruction of canon that he established himself. This series rides roughshod through the canon of ALL previous ST series. Kill off all the protovulcans from Mintaka 3? Why not? Wreck just about everything done before? Why not? (Heck, our boy JJ blew up the planet Vulcan. It must be open season.)

Beyond the fact that this is a Star Trek show from a completely alien universe, it is a good show.",27 October 2018
"I've watched every series over the years and each one has their merits regardless of who the stars are. The story and character development of this show plus action makes this one of the if not the best ever ST.

For those who are rating this series poorly, all I can say is shame on you.

To the producers - Thank you for continuing to outdo yourselves series after series and movie after movie!",14 November 2021
"Science fiction that is different and unexpected is indeed fresh !

Not a re-run star trekkie version of what some expect !

Not copying the persona we thought were Klingons is disturbing the trek fans !

But edge of your seat entertainment it is , of fresh science fiction goes where my imagination fails to go !

Grateful I am they do not copy old trek personas and no reruns here !

I thought it the best futuristic series in many years !

Many reviewers complain that characters are different and casting opinions vary but in all those type viewers they expect a remake which all ways fail to go into fresh territory !

I truly like the inventive genius that sets off the imagination once again ! About Time we move on with from Star Trek copying and go where no Federation ship dare go !",24 October 2017
This is a interesting take on a new way. Everyone complaining that the acting is bad. Jame T Kirk was bad acting. Sounds like spilled milk. Discovery was based on diversity and not retelling and trying to expand on the idea of what gene Roddenberry had an idea of. We are always. Looking for more of the same thing. Just like Picard isn't a continuation od Next Gen.,21 July 2021
"Modern, current with today's times, this new Star Trek is everything we could ask for. It's visually stunning (along the lines of GOT), brilliantly written, and well acted and cast.

Six episodes in this is becoming my favorite Trek, and I've seen THEM ALL!

The naysayers out there just want them to do a reboot of TV from the 60's, or 80's and that just won't fly anymore. That's what streaming is for. Rewatch the classics!

This new series is fresh and new and the ideas of bending the federation rules and to see that everything is not always ""perfect"" on a starship is realistic and intriguing.

Glad it's making record numbers for CBS all access and that it has been renewed for season 2 already.

My only complaint so far is that it's only the streaming platform which you have to pay for. But, I do understand the business model, and I'm begrudgingly paying cause it's so good!",23 October 2017
"The acting, for the most part, is TERRIBLE. Saving graces are Doug Jones and Mary Wiseman. (Tilly is too talented for this)

Only watched 1st season so far. Stories are mediocre with exception to the three part ""mirror universe"" story line. That one is abominable!

Watched out of morbid curiosity. Giving it a solid ""meh""",15 August 2019
"I have read the hateful reviews on this new addition to the Star Trek Family. There seems to be one crucial piece of information missing.

Does this Star Trek stem from the Legacy Timeline we all have come to love in the 60's, or is this a byproduct of the new Timeline that J.J. Abrams has created for us?

Regardless of the side you choose, this new series is full of controversy, indifference, and war. New Tech, and Old Tech. A plausible explanation to the ""plot holes"" that the haters bring to light that might also be future ""story development"".

What I do know about this series is that Discovery is not out to explore strange new worlds. Discovery was not cast out to the Delta Quadrant, or traversing the expanse. It surely is not a Space Station protecting a stable wormhole. The center stage is not set on a Captain, Ship, or location. This is a demonstration of the costs StarFleet had to pay. This is the price for exploring the unknown and meeting new species.

Conflict with The Klingons and the war between the Federation and the Klingon Empire that we kept hearing about, we finally get to see. We get to watch how it was started, and hopefully we will get to witness the end. Then maybe...just maybe...the writers will drop a hint as to what Timeline we should be focused on.

Until then...Leave the hate and the arguments between your Trekkie friends. Just watch the new addition to the Star Trek family Grow Up just as the others did. Ohh...and don't forget to enjoy the show.",9 November 2017
"This show is not only the worst Star Trek ever, is the worst Science Fiction in the history of tv series is a total mockery for viewers. That is Burnham's anatomy show in space",5 December 2020
"The show is great in my opinion(but only because I dont know what feminism is, nor i label based on first impressions, and especially since i have never watched the old series..therefor i am not bigoted nor narrow minded )",3 March 2019
Love this series already. Lots of other Trekkies out there are being way too critical of this series opener. It looks lot a great series with a fantastic lead actor. She is a great addition to the Star Trek universe. I hope this series maintains its high quality and will keep being made for years to come.,30 September 2017
"I have always loved Star Trek and am shocked by the mixed reviews this great series is getting. This is new and exciting with a lot of dark undertones and depth to the story. It explores inner conflict, trust and loyalty on many levels. I love the mycelium concept. I can't get enough of this series",25 January 2018
Love this show. Wonderful characters and episodes.,21 January 2021
Its so dark and so over dramatic You hope the next episode becomes better but NO it became worse ! It's frustrating they kill the good shows and they keep the bad ones,10 January 2021
"Trouble with these places is all the haters gather to quash the shows they don't like, The people who enjoy it don't leave reviews so its not an accurate depiction of a show . ignore the reviews and just sit and watch the show make your mind up yourself you may like it you might not thats life, Discovery is what star trek is meant to be escapism and it succeeds in that explore new worlds meet new races and civilisations, star trek Discovery has a large and growing fan base what easily outweighs the toxic fans the baggage what follows with a franchise like star trek. overall a great show, looking forward to more",14 December 2020
"I've been watching a lot of tv recently, partly because I'm bored, but also because there's so much of it now, streaming its way into everyone's living rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, cars, gyms, daycare ... you name it, there's a tv show playing. Some of it is good. Most of it isn't. What's unfortunately apparent is that there simply aren't enough good writers for the hundred new shows each year. There are plenty of good actors, good directors, good stylists, etc. But the most noticeable feature of all these new shows is that the writing is dismal.

This show is a perfect example. Great acting, great sets, great direction, and scripts that are barely coherent. The dialogue is stilted, silly, or unintelligible. The plots are simple. The characters are poorly formed. It's as if a group of writers was given a few days to sketch out an entire show, and they lost interest half way along. Plot lines that could have been rich are threadbare by the time they are played out. Characters that could be iconic are instead embryonic. Stories that could have been mythic are simply silly.

Why spend so much money on everything else, but fail to hire good writers? The answer has to be that there are simply too many shows hiring now, and there aren't enough writers to supply them all with the scripts necessary to make these shows shine.

They don't shine. They glimmer, they spurt, and then they fade. Such a shame.",7 February 2019

"Reading other reviews I have to ask the question, were you watching the same series as me? I will admit the the first 2 episodes were slow and not that gripping, but when you get past them, the series was very well written. The storyline had me hooked and I especially enjoyed the twists in the plot. Saying it's not in Star Trek tradition is nonsense. It very often has references to Star Trek Enterorise. I for one am looking forward to season 2......Bring it on!!!",4 January 2019

I'm a science fiction fan, and as someone who loves science fiction, but doesn't know much about Star Trek Lore, the show is very pleasant to watch, with good actors, nice plot and great special effects.

So, if you like science fiction give it a try.",9 October 2017
"First season will annoy Trek fans for the many deviations from cannon. Second season will disappoint with character that you don't care about. From there, it gets worse and worse. You'll be subjected to poorly written stories loaded with politics bluntly forced down your throat.",26 January 2018
Absolutely phenomenal!!! Incredible characters modernized for 2021 with all of the familiar themes and settings of all the Star Trek franchise. If you love Star Trek this show will take you to a entirely new level.,19 January 2021

Though many parts of the various storylines don't seem to line up with the original Star Trek timeline, I personally don't mind because of well round each episode is.",1 February 2019

"I've been a Star Trek fan since TOS. I respected Picard, was able to cope with Janeway, absolutely loved DS9, liked ENT, and even got to accept JJ Abrahm's reimagination thanks to the very good actors, but this? This I can't do.

STD is absolute garbage. It starts with ape-like ""Klingons"" chanting with subtitles and leads to a bunch of right-wing extremist warmongers leading Star Trek astray from its original exploratory vision, towards a Resident Evil-like faction of warmongers who will do anything to get the newest killer toy.

It doesn't stop there. Sonequa Martin-Green was a brooding outsider in The Walking Dead, with the personality of an empty AR- 15 mag, but that was by choice. In STD she plays the same character yet again. Every Star Trek lead before her, from Kirk to the new Kirk, had something to be admired or respected. Character, personality, charisma.

Michael Burnham has none of it. Sonequa Martin-Green acts stiff and distant, without demanding the respect Vulcans usually do. She is just there, and nobody would miss her if she wasn't.

Gone are the glorious days of the Son's of Mogh and Urthog. Klingons are nothing more than religious zealots now. No more passion. No more blood whine. They might as well be Vulcans.

Even the Defiant, the most war-like starship ever in the Federation, went on the occasional science mission during the Federation- Dominion war. The Discovery is nothing more than a lab for bio-weapons with a bunch of xenophobic extremists. Michael can act the goodie-two-shoes all she wants, nobody believes it.

I once thought the new Star Trek movies would be the end of the franchise. I was wrong. This TV show is.

Star Trek Discovery has nothing alike with Star Trek, except for a Star Trek-sticker on the box.",9 October 2017

"Imagine someone with a serious mental deficit. Licks trees, rubs faeces in their face while laughing, eats soil etc. That would be the personification of the dialogue, science, and writing of this series. Its so dumb, I almost had several brain aneurysms. Nothing makes sense on ANY level, and things are just made up in order to progress the narrative. Regardless of how retarded it is and with zero respect for the audiences intelligence. Tarka is meant to be a genius in an advanced human civilisation and the amount of times he should know a better alternative hes like, yep lets just NOT do that. Zora is an advanced AI with the knowledge of the galaxy and is as much use as a C flavoured lollipop. Book is obviously colour blind to not seen a thousand red flags. And Michael is the most emotional captain and adoptive Vulcan you would never ever see. Seriously, if you like your IQ where it is, dont watch this absolute mess. Season 4 was not just difficult to sit through, it turned out to be impossible. If this was a true federation vessel filled with these people, it would crash the second it left space dock while taking half the armada with it.",21 March 2022
"I have not watched star trek before. I have seen a few episodes of an old one and not liked them. I had been seeing this title in Netflix, so i decided to give it a shot since i loved Expanse. Now it's my favorite show of all the available shows in Netflix. At first it did seem a bit stiff, but the main character Michael is really relatable and i like the struggle between emotion and logic, i also used to struggle with that. I'm also impressed by her acting. I like the captain and the science guy as well, but i find Tilly and Saru a bit too hard for me to relate to. Either the show hasn't shown a lot of their personality or they are just too different from me. It is important for me that there is progression in the story line and i like episodes that make permanent changes. I was afraid that star trek would have a new adventure every episode, but that is not the case here. There are several episodes, which actually progress the story, although the latest one with the time loop left me disappointed.",2 November 2017
"As someone who grew up and loved SNG (Patrick Stewart is the best!) Ive always followed and enjoyed all of the ST franchises. This one, after 30 years of watching, is alot more refreshing. Its dark, alot more realistic to human nature and its set during a WAR so its going to be darker than the other series of ST. All of the other series besides DS9 were pretty much the same and didnt really deal with a full scale war. I know die hard fans will be all about the prime directive and what it means to better than humans can be and how when we put all our differences aside theres nothing we as a race can not achieve, nothing that cant be solved, overcome and conquered. No challenge too great and how we should except everyone no matter what or who they are. I get that. But after going over the same old platform its so refreshing to see a darker take, just like the remake of the movies. It is afterall, entertainment. It shouldnt be taken so seriously and maybe im biased after quickly developing a massive crush on Sonequa Martin-green, that girl's so easy on the eyes. If your not a ST fan then maybe this is for you. Die hard fans will find fault no matter what....even the shade of blue uniforms is probaly all wrong. I will say, The USS Discovery is by far the ugliest ship ive ever seen!",13 January 2018
"Bolding going where no Trek show has gone before

First off this isn't your Star Trek of old. Im a causal fan of Star Trek. I have watched all the shows and movies both past and present. The hardcore fans might be upset since their Star Trek of old has changed into the New Trek which focuses highly on action over talking. Also they might hate the update on ships and species but I highly believe it's the correct move. I for one thought the new films and this series reminded me of a merging of Star Trek and Star Wars Yet even with that said this series has a fresh feel to it with hints of old Trek mixing with the new. Don't listen to the naysayers. Go into this with an open mind because it's the only logical way of enjoying what it is......A new Star Trek show and truthfully we've waited to long for it!!! Only issue I have is the going away from airing on a regular TV time but times are changing so too must the shows.I've enjoyed the characters but it seems to focus only on the main character which is different and only time will tell if that was a mistake....yet so far I've enjoyed the story and pace. Hope this lasts I highly enjoy it",2 October 2017

You got it! Like four letter words? Done! Enjoy hearing about ""Ma-Feelz"" and crying? 30 times an hour! I have been a huge ST fan as long as I can remember. There is a huge difference between true diversity and pandering. STD (aptly named) is a huge disappointment. FAIL.",2 May 2022
"What is with the uninspiring long speeches from Michael Burnham in season 4 she is better off not being the captain or needs to start acting like a captain. Bring back Tilly the heart of the show, because the show has lost something this season its star trek not star talk.",10 March 2022
"This show will never, ever get any better.

Time to cancel this divisive, hateful and exclusionary show right now. It is a far far cry from even TNG and gone in a warped woke direction which has no place on our screens. Shame on you CBS, what have you become...",9 January 2022
"Finally a refreshing and outstanding show that actually makes you believe that you are watching a real story instead of a collection of sidekicks and sit-com joke scenes with the occasional Easter egg thrown in for the old-timers. The characters are visceral and flawed, the story is complex and unpredictable and the effects are movie quality. I was initially skeptical of another spin off show but this one has depth and emotion that instantly make it something you can buy into. Many of the low ratings seam to come from people looking for some sort of cookie-cutter trek repeat series that has more in common with an after-school special than a dramatic TV series that has bite and meaning. Great job on this series!!!",6 February 2018
"I don't wite reviews. It's not my thing. I have watched Star Trek all my life. Some I have enjoyed and some I have not. It's a personal choice really. I found some shows exciting and adventurous and others not so. The movies have been awesome. Again some not so. It's really up to the story teller to provide the imagery and detail. That's the essence of what makes a story so good. Star trek is amazing. It brings a positive vibe to all our futures. All of us. And the story tellers over time have become better at telling thir story. This, I feel, is the reason for the changes in story canon, imagery, characters and technology. It simply changed because the story teller was better at providing imagery and detail. This is why the Klingons look different. Its why the technology seems so much more modern. It's why the story need to change somewhat. And its why the imagery and effects are so much better. The story teller didn't have all this before. Discovery, at it's core is pure Trek. It's grand story telling; taking what we know and expanding on it. Providing emotion and feeling to some otherwise geat stories. Michael Burnham is a flawed, emotional and intelligent character, the centrepice to THIS Trek story, as so many others characters have had the shows and movies revolve around them. Some episodes not as good as others, but thats how it goes. To me it has provided an eventful and brilliant Star Trek experince and I hope it continues. And it's a lot of fun as well!",16 August 2019
This series has become one of my favorites in the Star Trek universe. It's rich and beautiful.,27 February 2021
"This series started out strong - good stories and action, great characters and good fare for two seasons. It started going off the rails in the third, reached rock bottom in the fourth and is still digging hard. First two seasons are worth watching, third would be OK if you have nothing better to do. The fourth and on are unwatchable.",16 January 2022
"I understand why all the purist will hate this edition of STAR TREK, It's certainly unlike any STAR TREK I've ever seen. It's dark and it's definitely not a Gene Roddenberry vision of STAR TREK... But I still like it.

STAR TREK: Discovery, describes one of the darkest times in the STAR TREK saga, the war against The Klingon, and wars are not nice and fluffy, so it is only fitting, from my point of view, that this series isn't either.

I grew up with Starship Enterprise and I loved it! (still do to some extend) I also loved Voyager when that came along, thou not as much as I did Enterprise, not because it was worse, but because I had grown older, and even thou both series dealt with the darker aspects of humanity, they always did it in way that smelled a little to much of dandelions and daffodils. It was all very PG, which is great if you're a youngster and imagine love is eternal and girls don't fart. But it doesn't represent the real world... victims doesn't always get a dying last word or a beautiful death and the hero doesn't always save the day.

This is different, and it feels more real to me, and for that, I like it.

Bottom line: If you're a purist and only wish to experience the magic of the past, then stay away from this, you will hate it!

If you're the kind of person who just love Sci-fi in all it's aspects, and who doesn't mind the ""breach of STAR TREK lore"" I think you will really like this Show.",2 October 2017
What I hate most about these series is all the dialogs with insecurities of the crew. They are professional trained Star Fleet crew but it's like I'm watching high school friends constantly trying to compliment en motivate each other. To much of these annoying dialogues.,10 November 2021
I absolutely love the show! The story line is exciting. The actors are great. The uniforms are dope. I'm glad in season 3 they changed Burnham hair. She is stunning and it's nice to see the happier side of her! Tilly is a perfect fit.,21 November 2021
"Exciting, clever, creative.

This is one of the best shows I have ever seen in my life. And I say that being a series addict, I see three or four different ones a day. In particular, I enjoy good writing.

Of course, if you are looking for a show with only violence, shots, space battles, it may not be ideal. These elements are very present, but this is a show about different cultures interacting. There is good drama combined with a quick pace and scifi of the best quality.

In addition, if you are one of those crazy reactionaries who is deeply bothered by any mention of progressive themes, the series will also irritate you (which caused this flood of unfair low grades).

However, if you're smart, you'll love it.",2 January 2021
This is the core of Star Trek. Belief in the beauty of progress and humanity.,29 November 2020
"I am truly shocked by all the bad reviews. Who are these people and are they sure they have actually watched the same series I have?

I have been a Star Trek fan for well over 20 years, from s01e01 of TNG right up to the finale of season 3 of discovery. (Warning my next statement may cause controversy haha) I personally believe Discovery is an absolute masterpiece, Burnham, Tilly, Saru and everyone else are absolutely first class.

The storylines (across all seasons) are truly superb, and the finale of season 3 had me standing up and clapping in admiration and excitement for what is to come next.

The visuals, story, bold and brave new direction are all a work of pure genius.

As a huge sci-fi fan in general this has absolutely everything.

It has almost become quite sad and pathetic that as a Star Trek fan it's almost become compulsory to slate and dismiss any modern attempt at Star Trek, like an idiotic ""Comic Book Guy"", please people stop this ridiculous behaviour and stand up and enjoy this absolutely wonderful Star Trek branch.",15 January 2021
"Besides all of the failures in logic, storytelling and production involved in this series overwhelmingly explained well by others, this is my disappointment with STD. It is a different show every season. The first season was a bizarre take on the Klingons, amazing tech never seen before yet we're in the past and mirror universe nonsense. Then the second season is a completely different show with many different flaws, but it somewhat served as a prequel to TOS. This third season, 900 years later, is a completely different show with different issues and characters. No character from the first two seasons, except the crew, can be part of season 3and beyond. It's as if each season is a new pilot series trying to find one that works. None of them have worked. Give it up.....",12 January 2021
"It took me a while to watch this series, when it first came out I tried a few episodes and even though I liked it, just didn't get into it. Flash forward to season 3 and I binged the show in a weekend and boy this time I got hooked.

This story lines have become more developed and each character has become more and more interesting in and of themselves, not just as part of the overall story. I find that I really care about how things affect each of them in different ways.

The show has achieved a good balance between classic Trek ideals and updating obvious cultural changes in our own society. The writing and direction of each episode has continued to improve upon the previous episodes.

So glad I gave this show another chance...",5 November 2020

"I scratched my head for years now wondering why people hate Discovery. In the eginning I thougt it has to do with some details of the lore, Klingons without hair and so on. But now it becomes clearer and clearer. A lot of people habe difficulties with emotions. ST Discovery has a target audience being able both: think and feel! This is the problem not the series itself. It is done in such a high qualitity with a deep narrative. If you compare it to TOS then you can find the deepest continuity of all the aspects Roddenberry expressed reflected in exponentially complexity.",2 January 2021

"It seems like many have forgotten what Star trek is all about. And not taking learning from it. The hate this show is getting is funny, because hate was nothing that Roddenberry was after, and still you don't give it a chance...

"The first 2 1/2 seasons were great but it has gone down in a big way! The acting is dreadfull and the scripted has everyone crying on each others shoulders all the time. There isn't one strong character in the show and the captain is patronising in the way she speaks. It seems like the writers are pandering to an certain group of viewers? I have completely stopped watching this show now. Hopefully the spin of show from this show will be better?

Star Trek Picard and all the cartoons are so much better.

I'm giving it 2-1/2 for the first 2-1/2 seasons! Hopefully they will axe it next year?",12 May 2022
I really like this show. I saw a review that tore this show apart. I don't get it. I go into watching a show with it as it's their story to tell. If I connect with the characters then thats all it takes. I've learned through the years that there are always going to be big bad and they save the day. Some stories are more interesting than others but I really like the concept of this series. I'll keep watching.,23 July 2020

I'm puzzled at the reviews that reflect such incredible disappointment. Perhaps people are used to a more fluffy Star Trek; whereas, this show is edgy, fresh and new. I appreciate the characters, dialogue and story lines. Additionally, I have not seen anything that completely violates continuity with the other shows (although boundaries have definitely been pushed). I see complaints about the newer looking bridge in comparison to others. My thinking is that what looks new to us could look old to others in the future. It could simply be a different design with many more lights. I appreciate this work.",17 October 2017
The stories have got progressively worse and morphed into ridiculous sci fi complex problem stories which only Michael can solve. But I'm tired of Michael's whispering.

Like the Star Trek movies, Mission Impossible, James Bond, and all episodes of Star Wars except 4-6 the title has been used to falsely attract an audience expecting a truthful rendition of the the ideals, goals, space adventure, alien encounters, thought provoking morality and 'fun' as Gene Roddenberry foresaw. Instead we have shallow characters wandering aimlessly through episodes with little character development and personal chemistry. It was a mess right from the first episode not knowing who was in charge of Discovery. The captain is two dimensional; a tribble on his desk is insulting to the original series. But worst of all is the female lead who is out of her depth and miscast. And homosexual characters? Not in Star Trek. This series has always been about exploring space, encountering civilizations and character interaction without the vehicle of sexual behaviour; straight or gay. In summary, if you 'know' Star Trek; if you loved the original characters; if you loved TNG and you appreciate sci-fi story-telling that raises moral and ethical issues without political or gender statements, then this special effects ddirectionless 'experiment' gone wrong will be a waste of your time. At least the Orville made me laugh. Star Trek RIP.",8 January 2018
"I was a little dubious about the first series but so far 10 episodes in I'm loving the second and hope it will carry on getting better to the haters out there accept that you cannot simply remake the old series. They are there to enjoy and this series has its own character to enjoy. Skip past series one if you must and head straight to series two, for a well made and more developed sci-fi romp",25 March 2019
"short : if you liked last ST movies/Game of Thrones/Expance you will probably enjoy the series as well.

in long term: Never liked ST Series because it was to childish for me. But last ST Movies got lately my attention and the Series as well, after 3 episodes i cant wait for next.

It's brutal (IMHO), more realistic(klingon are now bad as) and not that pacifistic like old series. (""let send them a vulcan hello"") I liked the decisions of main character which sometimes logical/pragmatic sometimes are emotional (ravenge driven) and not so static like old series where you already know what the main protagonist will do.

For me the show is in the same league as expanse although they are different.",2 October 2017
"Maybe because I'm a cynic at heart, I was skeptical of this series before I even watched one episode, or maybe I'm getting too old, but in any case I kinda liked it! I was pleasantly surprised. I guess it depends on your frame of mind when you start watching and maybe it's been too long between Star Trek TV show, It had some nice Star Trek stuff through out and moved along nicely. I recommend at least giving it a shot.",8 March 2018
No like the older versions but a great addition to the cannon,27 May 2020
"A total waste of a great budget. If they took out all the PC alphabet claptrap, they'd have a half dozen really awesome shows for production quality and story's are ok except bogged down with all the emotional baggage. I think I'm done watching. Hopefully CBS doesn't ruin Picard.",6 December 2021
"I like it. Good effects, good makeup, better writing than most Trek arcs. I'm happy I'm not brainwashed into thinking all of the other Trek stories are perfect as they are.

I love Sonequa Martin-Green. Great choice to try this little experiment of better storytelling within the Trekkie universe.",14 September 2021
"----- Hail all crew of the Discovery. This is your captain speaking. You are all utterly useless and clueless. Probably the most pathetic crew ever put in charge of a Federation Starship. That is of course except for Michael Burnham who can do no wrong, who has the answer to every convcievable scenario and who will always single handedly save the day, every time. ------

I've binged watched ST:D over the past week and simply can't take it any longer. While I'm no where near being a Trekkie, I've always been a fan which is why I've given ST:D a fair shot despite the fact that the character of Michael Burnham is simply unbearable.

Spock is a character that fans of the show have literally grown up with. Through various incarnations of the show his history has been pretty consistent even through the reboots.

Now we have the character of Michael Burnham necessitating a rewrite of his entire history.

Well I'm now done with ST:D. Now looking forward to the next season of Another Life which as bad as it is, is still better than the unbearable Micheal Burnham Show.",15 December 2019
"I was instantly hooked, the show improves with every season and the CGI is great.",22 November 2020
"The concept of Star Trek is genius. I'll give another perspective to a common criticism of this show later.

First it's worth noting that, when they were making TOS, they were creating a world and a system of ideas that is, and are, fascinating. I've long thought if a team could make them relevant to today's audience, the next generation of fans (pun intended) would get the opportunity to be as thrilled with the idea of Star Trek as I was growing up.

This show does just that.

The lofty core tenets of strength through diversity that Star Trek was built on are alive and well in this show. I'd even go as far as to say that early Star Trek's impact on society, in some way, laid the foundation for the today's recognition of the value of those principles. Millions grew up seeing a diverse cast do incredible things, placing those values in our consciousness. And if not in our reality, as a goal worth chasing.

Discovery is doing it's best in the same tradition. And it takes all the cool tech and stuff about the universe and brings it to life though fresh graphics and characters. You'll see little nods to other shows throughout.

As for the criticism of the tech being too cutting edge, I offer another type of logic ;)

When they were making TOS, I have no doubt they were doing their best to realise a world in film that would challenge our imaginations with things we hadn't dreamed of. I bet they pushed special effects and creativity to the very limits of their abilities, for the benefit of the audience of yesterday.

Yes, the graphics and tech in this show are advanced. But I would offer that the show makers are making this show with the same spirit as the show makers of the original -- to blow people's minds with cool space tech and stories.

It's far more important uphold the original show's intentions of making the most engaging show they can, than to strive to be true to the limitations of the graphics and special effects of the past.

This is a crucial way in for a new audience, whose level of expectation of what a good sci-fi show can be, start where TOS, TNG, DS9, and the rest, left ours.

It's my hope this show will engage a new audience with what Star Trek is, beyond the gadgets, and that it will lead them to a 'discovery' of some of the magical shows created before it. Because, once you're in love with the story, the format, the universe... the celebration of human potential... the futuristic gizmos are just icing on the cake.

Keep going, we need more.",31 July 2021
"I think a largely successful continuation of the Star Trek franchise. Maybe a little too touchy feely for someone who watched the first ever episode in the 60s, but hardly surprising in these days. Very impressed generally, but perhaps too much special effects instead of more character development, and less obvious anguish over decision making would be an improvement. But, I liked it enough to watch it all through with enthusiasm. There's a bit of Shattner about Anson Mount, which in my mind was a very good thing, and I think Spock nailed it. What's next?",8 May 2019
I understand this is how tv shows are now. Not as I don't know as episodic as tng ds9 and voyager. Which I do miss. That being said I still love space stuff generally no matter what. Season 1 was mediocre but it gets better. Worth watching give it a chance. Don't get it canceled to early like enterprise,30 October 2020
"Frankly so far, having sat through two seasons and now beginning the third, I'm VERY disappointed. Not that other Treks weren't character driven but no real time has been spent on seriously developing the characters of the crew! Yes, we've seen their back stories and they've had some adventures together but not NEARLY as much as Goddess Burnham!

Sadly, this and Picard have both become virtue signaling vehicles for the producers who do not really realize that anyone who loves Star Trek and is a committed fan does not need these p.c. cues. I will watch them but so far, I must say it's some sentimental silliness on all fronts.",17 October 2020
"This draws on inspiration from Gene Roddenberry's universe and richly sketches out deep characters with intertwoven story arcs. Traditionalists who can't stand occasional bad language and authentic bursts of laugh out loud humor don't need to watch. May this show live long and prosper. This is not Voyager, DS9, Generations, TOS, or Enterprise... This is DISCOVERY",18 January 2019
"Sad to see what has become of Star Trek on TV. This show is quite bad. Every now and then, they'll show you a glimpse of what they could achieve (as a show) but no, then it's back to a truckload of incoherent, inconsistent rubbish again. Very sad to see. I only managed to watch season 1 and most of season 2, but then I was forced to give up (just too much nonsense for me) ANYhoo, I really hope the writers managed to course-correct in season 3 - who knows? Stranger things than that have happened ..?",27 July 2019
So many knockers of Star Trek Discovery. I love all of the Discovery series and can't wait for season 4. Suggestion for the knockers - don't watch it and keep your negative comments to yourself.,21 January 2021
Guess iam the only one here......nice SFX and maybe its time for a new Star Trek old bitter basterds,17 January 2018
"I'm not sure why all the negativity. Sure, there is a bit of melodramatics, at times, but for the most part, this show is fantastic!!! I love sci-fi and have always enjoyed most Star Trek series. I am a bit disappointed that ""Trekkies"" cannot step outside their TOS box to enjoy Discovery, but to each their own! The visuals are amazing and most of the cast is phenomenal. A lot of these folks don't even like Strange New Worlds, which is also awesome. I just cannot take those opinions seriously. If you haven't watched, pay no mind to the naysayers (I think they might be a bit special and not in a good way lol) and give it a try!!",5 April 2019
"The absolute worst part of this series is that the writers pandered like crazy to a woke mob that doesn't even watch Star Trek. Every two seconds has a gut punch, the writers and actors reminding you that they hate you with a passion if you don't agree with EVERY aspect of their world view.

Star Trek always approached political and social issues in a dispassionate and constructive way. This time the show first and foremost seeks to check all the right boxes, even when it is done at the expense of a quality story. The writing is dull, the stories are garbage, and this formula that ALL shows seem to have now (where the entire series is basically one loooooong episode) is tiring. I miss Janeway.",20 July 2022
"People seem to have very strong feelings about this product, based on other reviews. I think it is a quality effort, but indeed it is radically different from any other ST television product. The tone is far more... adult. Darker. But then again, it's essentially a war series, so some grim reality & shocking murders aren't out of place. This isn't your grandma's Star Trek, lol.

Visually it feels like a comparable treatment to ST: Enterprise as the JJ Abrams films did to TOS. Drenched in visual detail, with a quicker pace. The acting can seem stiff or rushed at times, (perhaps though due to the sheer volume of exotic technical jargon), but overall a solid crew. If it didn't have the ST name it would still stand on its own.",6 March 2019
"I mean, why didn't they just create a different sci-fi series with a different title. I might have been on board. But I went in expecting Star trek and left empty handed. Very disappointed.",5 August 2021
"Star Trek: Discovery have everything needed to create an awesome Star Trek series =

1- Beautiful opening theme, creative, new, it is an story in itself, and in context with the Star Trek history.

2- Incredible actors/actresses and characters, really, the production really nailed the, so far, all the know characters. I felt a sort of kinship with each of them and their relations with each other.

3- Klingons galore, awesome characterization and... ""Qapla'!!!!"" :P

4- Awesome production, sounds, music, special effects... we are finally in the 22nd century ( or would it be 23rd? :P )! One more ""Qapla'!!!!"" :P

I was never so happy to have a Home Theater to experience the full range of ""emotion"" evoked by the soundtracks.

So, yeah, in short, go watch it with open eyes and an open mind, it will blow it away (really) and don't mind the haters, they are so busy trying to hate everything related to the new Star Trek series that it is quite sad (and funny) to look at them.",26 September 2017
"Yes this is maybe different with old star trek series, Yes its focus on Burnham

Thats make its different, different angel and interest.

Lets watch this movie with clear mind, not bring and hope old star trek series to Discovery series.

The plot is good. Graphic excellent",11 July 2020
"I'll pass on describing all the usual things that people rate. Instead, I'll simply say, that this is at best, a seriel made to appeal to the adolescents. Yep, just another super hero type movie, only in installments. Lots of whiz bang, lots of poorly explained twists that make no sense, and need you to suspend belief as they keep changing things and play loud music to make it all seem 'epic'. Acting is decent, and it's watchable, mostly because everything is on a big screen now with lots of flashy colors. But it's basically a B movie plot. Five stars. I had no problem getting up and going out for ice cream in the middle of pretty much any episode, there was no feeling of 'I can't wait to see what comes next'. If you loved all the recent super hero movies, with lots of action and things blowing up, you'll love this. If, OTOH, you like well written plots, like so many of the DS9 stories, you might be disappointed.",17 May 2018
"As someone whose favourite series is TNG, for full disclosure, I am really enjoying this series several episodes in. The first episode i was wary, as i really didn't enjoy Enterprise, although i appreciate the overall gradual social evolution from a post WW III, recently space-faring civilization that all of the series embody.

I find the characters unique. They don't feel like re-used tropes, but genuinely new personalities. And finally there's a gay couple! TOS broke ground having a black woman on screen with key job on the bridge and it took till 2017 to get a gay couple. But at least it's finally happened. And the lead role by Sonequa Martin-Green is refreshing.

To avoid spoilers, i won't go into detail, but while there is tech that seems out of place in the canonical chronology of the ST universe, my attention is still piqued by the new and very imaginative exploration in that area of the show as well.",7 November 2017
"I saw the reviews and thought they had pretty well summed up this terrible representation of the Star Trek series'.

Then I saw the overall rating was 7.0 and I said ... huh?

Obviously, anyone earning a paycheck on this bomb must have rated it sky-high, but giving it more than a 2 (yes, there were one or two pretty pictures)is being much too generous.

I knew going in there would be no real male lead, but no men at all? And I knew Michelle Lee could act, but even she delivered her lines as if bored to death.

With so many bad new series coming to TV, full of trash and PC'ism, I had hopes they wouldn't sabotage Star Trek as well.

Anyway, I entered my rating to offset one of the cast of this misbegotten mess.",25 September 2017
"Ever since Stargate Universe stopped a couple of years ago I longed for a good space series.

Im not sure why lots of people don't like. Excellent special effects, Great acting by main characters and great special effects.

I loves the first 3 episodes, heres to the fourth.",5 October 2017
I will not have disgruntled idiots stop a show and genre I love by nitpicking a great show in their boxers in their mother's basement because they haven't gotten laid. So there's my 10 stars.,30 June 2019
"I've been reading all reviews on this show and it seems like it's mostly negative. Really?! Give the show a break, it's actually really well done. Awesome special effects, really cool story line, modern TV style storytelling (contiguous plot), character development, and actually a lot of attention to detail (lateral vector transporters!, that was a nice touch). Why is it that every time a company attempts to answer the pleads of every Star Trek fan to make a new show and all they are greeted with is negativity. Could you imagine if Firefly fans got a show and the first thing they did was bash it.

Let's look at this show the way it should be looked at, a new show all together. If you decided to look at all the Star Trek shows in this fashion even Enterprise suddenly becomes a decent show.

It seems like a lot of criticism is based around technology and timelines. Since this is a prequel why does the technology look light years ahead of anything we saw in the other TV shows, including Next Generation that took us over 100 years further into the future? Its because we have better technology now. It would be ridiculous to bring back analog knobs and single push buttons. They are doing some really cool stuff with holograms, sleeker shuttle designs and far more functional uniforms.

Discovery is a perfect mix of old and new Star Trek styles. It's a new Star Trek! Im excited! It does not have to be perfect, its a modern sci-fi show with a good budget and i will take it!",5 October 2017
"At first the new look and obvious changes in technology on the discovery put a slight taint on this new series. However the intriguing story lines and depth of characters storylines has made this a phenomenon to be reckoned with. The changes with the Klingon looks at first was something I thought bad but upon closer viewing a 2nd and 3rd time they look more natural than the original look more like they have evolve this way.

To anyone that has not yet seen this series view with an open mind as you will be pleasantly surprised and ""hooked""",20 September 2021
"I agree with all the negative reviews. With glimmers in season 1, I started to almost enjoy season 2 but the horrors of season 3 just keep mounting. Yes, the crying is bad, so, so, BAD. I have a theory that we are going to discover 'The Burn' was caused by a Woke inter dimensional entity who decided to teach the Federation a lesson on the evils of colonialism. EVERYTHING with this series is wrong.",23 December 2020
"All these cut and paste reviews need to go. Disco is a worthy successor to Trek. If you like the best of Trek (later TNG, DS9, and VOY), you will like Disco. Don't believe the haters! They don't understand Trek.",20 January 2021
Third season is just an endless cringe. Sonequa Martin-Green has just enough acting skills to act in painkillers commercials. There is literally not a single character I like in this show.,14 December 2020
"Awesome show that myself, friends & family look forward to watching every week. Can't wait for Season 5 and many more seasons to come. Keep up the great work all around Discovery crew !!! Let's fly !!!!",20 March 2022
This is a brilliant new show from the trek universe. You don't need to know all the previous trek history so you can enter into it fresh but there is also lots for those dedicated long term trek fans. For those long term fans don't expect a continuation of previous incarnations. There are some discontinuities and the 'feel' is different but if you just watch it as a new bit of sf you will very soon get into the new 'trekiness' of it As they say 'to boldly go where no trek has gone before...',24 October 2017
"I'm more of a Captain Picard and capt Archer fan but Discovery Grows on you by season 2 it is heart-felt and probably the best visual effect and sets in a Star Trek TV series since it's the newest current one.

Great acting and writing as well, contrasting characters! I love it!",21 May 2021
"Not only is this series not Star Trek, it's not good science fiction or tv. The plot holes and contradictions come thick and fast. The very premise of the ship's drive is so anathema to anything Trek it's astounding that they had the nerve to call it Trek.

What they have done to established races is disgusting. They don't understand how Vulcan or Klingon civilazations work. They can call it a mirror universe all they like but it's only a way to explain away the APPALLING storyline.

I'm revolted at some of the real Trek people involved in this horrid wreck of a franchise.

If you want something better, watch The Orville.",18 April 2018
"Ever since Alex Kurtzman became administrator of the franchise it pretty much died.

To say i had expectations for the show would be a lie.Terrible stories, complete disregard for the established lore , Kurtzman himself has been caught not knowing lore facts a tone of times in interviews and on top of it terrible actors, their qualification for taking the role being their diversity as Kurtzman has told (cause who needs good actors right?)

And excluding all these Kurtzman and partners attacking the fans for not liking the show",20 August 2020
"This is the best season of Star Trek Discovery so far, we have finally returned to better the world with the gentle humour from the previous series. It's great to feel like that I can't wait until the next episode again!

In season one I didn't even get why is this Star Trek, Season 2 it started to show early signs of improvement, season 3 is full of hope, dedication, acceptance, fighting together for a better tomorrow, for me, that's what Star Trek should be about.",5 December 2020
The first two episodes were alittle boring but it keep getting better and better till the end. Its really amazing and i enjoyed it although i dont really like the cast. This is one of the best scifi series i've seen.,5 March 2018
"Love this show. Yes Michael's whispering is annoying, but still a great show.",15 January 2021
"If you are baseing your fandom, on just next-Gen, ds9 and voyager, then yes, you will probably be disappointed. Next-gen was hated when it first came out. Star Trek Enterprise was very good although it is perceived not to be. In Discovery they give you familiarity with old characters (Pike, Spock) and do twist that are subtle but align with the franchise overall. It is well thought out to keep it true. This episode is the Star Trek formula to the tee utilizing new characters. Have an expectation from the humanity view point, and you will love Discovery. I missed out on Enterprise until I actually watched it. It was canceled early. Then it took almost another 15 years for another ST TV series (Discovery). If they stay consistent, then I will continue to watch. The crew is another true example of the Federation.",2 March 2019
I can't express my disappointment in this series. It is beyond words.,5 July 2019
"What made Trek enjoyable for me was the philosophy, the exploration, the inspiration. Discovery (and Picard) fail to do what Trek did best: use peace and egalitarianism to guide the show. To have a climax where a skillful debate outshone violence. Where our main characters help spread an ideal of utopian idealism to the rest of the galaxy. Discovery tries and sometimes succeeds in these goals, however, it's the feeling I get after watching Discovery that leaves me wishing a different creative team were in charge.

I miss the old Trek. The original series always dealt with different scenarios each episode, and felt fun, adventurous, and creative with characters that were loveable. Next Generation was slow, like drinking a cup of Earl Grey, and you could watch the episodes with your family and have big smile on your face at the end of the episode. Voyager thrust us into new territory seeking beautiful solutions to solving complex problems. Deep Space Nine may have been somewhat bland at times but at least it was a relaxing experience to watch.

Discovery just makes me feel anxiety, depression, and lacks the sense of wonder and awe that old Trek brought us. Money has instead been spent on computer graphics special effects and the creators have lost interest in the idea of exploring space, new worlds, and using a likeable or even loveable cast of characters to share these experiences with.

Discovery presents us with a set of flawed characters and one very not flawed superhero. It gets tiring to watch them, they're just not interesting and feel more like objects to propel a plot than real people. Many are very background, and so much emphasis is placed on Michael. Yes, Michael would be ok as a side character or in doses and the actress is a great actress. But I feel she hogs too much time, they plot invests too much into her, and the feeling of a true crew is somewhat lost.

Discovery doesn't fail at everything, it at its root still shines through at times with the old ideals of Trek. But the execution is poor. The lore is destroyed. The ships and art direction really look generic rather than build upon the 90s Trek look.

Unfortunately I feel that Discovery is the second worst of the franchise, with Picard being the obvious choice for the worst.

I say it's time to scrap this new Trek and make a calmer, more relaxing, fun show. This one always leaves me not wanting more, with a bitter taste in my mouth where the old Trek often left me feeling cathartic. This one feels like it hammers home the messages right on the nose where old Trek was more careful, subtle, and slipped things in.

Politically speaking, right wing folks will back away from this. Old Trek would often sneak in liberal, progressive, and socially just messages and plots in very clever and creative ways. The writers would wrap social messages and utopian ideals in a technologically sci-fi wrapping for us to enjoy... Unfortunately, Discovery does so rather clumsily, and the feeling I get is that they're merely virtue signalling rather than write compelling stories for a diverse audience. Why? Well, the writing feels that JJ style of lazy. Where so much is happening at break neck speed you forget what's even going on. And instead of coming up with ideas to explore in depth they're often surface level and just there to be there.

There are things I like about Discovery but I'd like them more if this were not ""trek"" but another generic science fiction show. It doesn't look or feel like Trek and I don't get the same positive, happy, chill feeling I used to get from the other iterations of the show. So I give this a 5/10. It barely does it for me, like treading water and gulping in sea water and nearly drowning in my tears that this is not really Trek but some mean, fast paced, shiny, empty, surface-level clone. I get small bits of enjoyment here and there since I'm a die hard Trek fan who has seen every episode and movie of Trek ever.

So if this isn't for me, the hardcore Trek fan, then who is it for? I don't really know. I think it's a failure in being true Trek emotionally, but barely passes the test and makes a C- grade for at least slavishly keeping to some of the old Trek truths.

If you're not crazy about Star Trek, don't bother with this one. This show will not bring in more people, it's not something investors should support, pull the plug and finance a show with better writers, and a lower budget, so that you can think creatively how to tell a story without just relying on special effects and horrors.",21 January 2021
"Discovery is a new approach to the world of Star Trek. By no means it is not something like TNG or ENT. It is an approach based on the emotions of the crew members and especially Michael Burnham who explores herself during the episodes. Very good shots but the storyline becomes very emotional. A lot of crying and personal moments and less action and explore. This is the reason why you will either love it or hate it. Personally, I would prefer it with less crying, especially of Michael. It's far from perfect but it's worth watching it, especially if you want to see another perspective from the Star Trek world than the ordinary.",8 January 2021
"Knowing that Brian Fuller is involved, I believe that the relationships among the characters will be build under a lot of pain, learning and sacrifice. By the second season, (I believe) they will really establish that strong confidence to one another. And we will know why they developed this strong loyalty. I love Kirk-McCoy-Spock trio, but I always did imagine that whatever brought them together as friends, was something that happened before we, the audience, know them. In ST Discovery, we are seeing why they will be, the way they will be. I don 't want more of the same. Roddembery would never shy away from discussing imperfections of the human civilization and society, and in the days of Trump, this view is more than appropriate. There is only imperfection in other species and civilizations? Absolutely not. The federation is made by humans, and humans are humans.",22 October 2017
"Expectations can be a hindrance and always bound to disappoint when elevated too high. I've been a Trek fan all my life....I'm currently 51. Discovered Trek when I was 7 in 1973 and been incredibly devoted to the franchise as long as I can remember. Without boring everyone with the long list of details as to why I love the series, you can be rest assured that the writing and vision has always reflected the human condition and potential in a sci-fi context in an intelligent more times than not, manner. I've watched all the incarnations come and go and have my personal favorites. Discovery, which takes place literally on my 300th birthday, has managed to take all the elements of drama known to the Trek universe which satiated my love for Trek lore, and wrapped it up in a 80 minute whirl-wind premier. It could have been a movie. The main characters are women which I believe account for the majority of some of the male haters listed in this block of reviews. Personally, I love it, like I loved Voyager. The numbers and ratings will reflect if this series gets a second season and I feel the writers have done more than necessary in preserving the Star Trek universe, while addressing the moral struggles that Trek has always done in the past still boldly taking chances with story and preconceptions. I am unabashedly pleased with what they have done so far and my wife and I anxiously await the next installment.",26 September 2017
"I've been around long enough to have been married with children when TOS first came on the air. I've followed all things ST (although not a Trekkie) except Andromeda. I love ST: Discovery. The writing is great although the first season wasn't the best. However, each season gets better, mysteries get solved in some pretty interesting ways, and character arcs have been fascinating to watch and while I have a few favorites, overall I like the team. I am so looking forward to next season.

"Initially, I was sort of looking forward to this show. Though not a huge Star Trek fan, I like scripted shows, which are in short supply these days. Alas, far from being merely boring, this iteration of Start Trek is downright unpleasant.

Here are some of the aspects of the show that make it an abyssal failure:

The main characters are the least likable ones on the show. Moreover, their behavior is offensive and detrimental to the ship's mission, yet you are expected to cheer for them?!?!?

What makes the show truly unwatchable, however, is the fact that it's first goal is clearly not to entertain. Whoever is behind the show clearly has an agenda. The show doesn't even feel like they are trying to tell you a story, so much as teach you all sort of lessons about how fun stuff like social justice, toxic masculinity, and all that super fun stuff. Put another way, it'f less like watching a TV show and more like sitting through a lecture about everything someone else thinks is wrong with you.

Basically, the show is a cringefest.

P.S. I am willing to bet the makers of STD (how funny is that acronym?) have spent a fair amount of money hiring people to post bogus reviews online because every site has this show rated way higher than it deserves. While I know most professional critics are merely studio shills, users are no so easily swayed and it appears there has been a massive effort on someone's part to mislead the public about the watch-ability of this particular show.",29 October 2017
"the show is far better then the bad critics here. bunch of st**** id***. and wtf would u compare it to the orville (thats a bad show, not funny, looks like a B-movie, and no excitement at all)

discovery is + interesting story + makes me wanna jump to every Sunday so i can see the next episode + good details + interesting characters - makes me sad that there aren't much more episodes to be aired

so haters go home",23 November 2017
"This series is much more down to Earth (no pun intended) The characters are more relatable than other series. I find Tilly is so more human as she has insecurities and venerabilities I can relate to, along with really progressive characters with the first gay couple and gender neural character.

With this it has a compelling story with powerful female characters leading the way.

This is the tip of the iceberg adding new species and old TOS characters who are so much better than the original.

In all, the overarching story line is better than the episodal set up and always has me sitting on the edge of my seat.",30 June 2021
"If you are stuck in the era of TOS or TNG and have no flexibility in your heart for Discovery you will find reasons not to enjoy this show. A number of the negative comments I have read a pretty shallow in my opinion.

This Trek is being made with the current technology for the big screen and it is done well. It looks great. TOS looked great for its time, this looks great for 2017. Have some flexibility in regards to the look of this show vs TOS and you'll enjoy it.

The first season for any TV series is the most important one. It is laying the foundation, setting up the story for future years. Yes the first few episodes focused on conflict and battle. But that set the scene for the rest of the season to grow from. As you move through the episodes you see the actors settling into the roles and that 'Trek' feeling starts to shine through. I dig it and will continue watching when it starts again in 2018.

If you aren't too stuck up about the previous Trek. If you can be logical and understand that our technology for cinema has changed, if you can understand that the distribution of shows these days has drastically changed compared with the 60 to the 80's and if you want to go on a new trek journey then tune into this one and give it a spin. Put your feet up and allow yourself to be entertained. LLAP",14 November 2017

"Star Trek Discovery has been able to make Star Trek work in the modern age. You won't see any of the charming, but unrealistic props as used in the original series, but rather a surprisingly broad array of amazing special effects arranged into beautiful shots that could easily be considered art. The cinematography alone is worth watching. While the characters could definitely use some more depth (the show has mostly focussed on a few characters rather than the big ensemble), let's keep in mind that Discovery is much more more plot-driven than ensemble-driven at this point in the series. This might be the biggest difference between Discovery and other Star Trek series. Thanks to its overarching plot line rather than a one-story-per-episode approach, Discovery's stories are much more worked out and are allowed to be bigger and more intense. The downside of this is that you can't watch a single episode on its own. Star Trek Discovery is an excellent gateway to other Star Trek series. It draws inspiration mainly from the original series and Deep Space Nine, which I would definitely recommend to anyone who likes Discovery (and also watch the universal favorite TNG of course). Discovery stays true to its name in every single way. Expect new perspectives, new times, radical shifts, and a wonderful new cast.",28 April 2019
"Having just watched season 1, I can say this is not Star Trek. It is a badly scripted parody, with badly written characters, and with the most ridiculous use of nonsensical science-babble.

Nothing about this respected Roddenberry's creation.

If those who wrote this season are gone, there may be hope for season 2.",7 January 2020
"Better and better with every new episode. I wasn't so sure about liking the show from starters, but didn't want to judge by seeing just two parts, that would be quite silly, wouldn't be? And as I presumed, the quality kicked in, although even those first episodes are quite good. My personal favorite aspects of the show so far are: 1) Jason Isaacs, great actor, i must say i dig this guy and he is just perfect for the role of the tormented captain. You can't go wrong with him and he slightly steals the show for himself, at least little me wise. 2) Story arch spread over more episodes, similarly to DS9 or third and fourth season of Enterprise. 3) Klingons - IMHO, they needed some revision and i totally love what designers made of them, be it new appearance, costumes, ships, speech, it's beautiful. 4) Discovery - great design, i like the bizarre new spore drive and the rotating saucer section is brilliant and cool idea. 5) Special effects - stunning, i would say the visuals are even better than in new Trek movies. 6) Harry freaking Mudd :) 7) One word: Gore. Okay, more words: I think proper gore scenes were always part of reality ST presented. No? Remember those massacred Klingons in ST VI. Told ya. And there would be more examples.",16 November 2017
"70% of the dialogues are unnecesary exposition about the boring main character and I'm not even talking about the crew giving constant ship status,that's normal.

Seriously, The Orville had more interesting dialogues and characters.

"This is absolutely NOT Star Trek. Star Trek has always been an exciting uplifting series that gives humanity hope and inspires us to look towards a future where we can be better than we are. Discovery is dark, dismal, depressing, one dimensional, and completely devoid of personality. Normally when I watch Star Trek, I find myself wanting to jump into the tv screen and be a part of the crew. But when I watch Discovery I find myself desperate to never be like these horrible, mean, and unfriendly people. Star Trek has always made me excited for the future. Discovery makes me horrified at what the future may hold. Here are a list of specific things I HATE about this series:

1.) The people are completely unlikeable. They are mean, unfriendly, miserable and have perpetual resting b-word face. They have no personality. I want nothing to do with these people. I don't like or care about any of them.

2.) It's dumbed down. The philosophical focus of Star Trek that attracts people who appreciate thought provoking material has been replaced by the over-use of CG, explosions, fight scenes, and sex to attract the lowest common denominator.

3.) There isn't any real discovery on this show, despite being on a ship called Discovery and the series called, Discovery. It's a science vessel that doesn't go out and discover interesting scientific stuff.

4.) It should be called Star Trek: Discovering Michael Burnham instead because this show is all about Michael Burnham. Since when has Star Trek been primarily about one person?

5.) The Klingons are no fun anymore. Klingons used to be chock full of personality and have always been a rowdy good time to watch. These new Klingons have even less personality than the humans. They are absolutely boring to watch.

I could go on and on about how horrible this series is but I don't want to waste anymore time on it. Discovery has no heart, no soul, no personality, and I have no hope for it.",29 July 2020
"I would say I'm surprised by the negative reviews of this show, but I AM NOT. The show flows right alone with the cheesiness we all know and love about Star Trek but there are a couple differences. For example, minority women are the backbone of the show. They are being desired and admired which don't sit right with a certain demographic who think science fiction is only for them. Also, let's not forget them showcasing ""black love"" and a way that is not full of struggle and disrespect. If it's not a minority with a white love interest, it make people uncomfortable. Meh, I digress.

What I love about the show: The happy endings, the motivational cheesy comments and the emotion that are left out of a lot of new shows. I love the character development of all of the characters.

What I don't love: The costumes. OMG! They can do so much better with a 6-8 million budget for each episode. Also, the hair on Micheal is hideous. They couldn't get a black hairstylist? Also, I don't like the plot of jumping so far in the future leaving their loved ones and actual reality. I really don't like the characters switch up without explanation either. Like who are these ppl on the ship out of no where?

Overall: Any person who enjoys the essence of Star Trek and can refrain from being prejudice or misogynistic would enjoy it.",18 March 2022
"What a great series discovery turned out to be. The first 2 seasons set the characters and narrative up really well along with a few eater eggs and nods to past great trek series. The character development whilst slow at points often is very well written and the general script for the first two seasons is very emersive touching on the mirror universe and even introducing a young spock. I can't help but feel the first two seasons got over burdened with great characters but not enough time or episode space for the less main story character s to get enough development, that's not to say they don't do an amazing job with the time they had. Going into season three the cast had some leave and some new member join and is by far the bests series with the potential being its set in a future yet to be portrayed in a trek series and the scriptwriters don't disappoint. All in all I feel its a great first 3 seasons and if what's to come follows in the footsteps of the last 3 seasons then I'm excited and look forward to many more seasons in the future. We'll done to the entire discovery team, the shows not perfect but it's certainly a giant leap towards it.",21 January 2021

"DISCO has the:

BEST PLOT development after Enterprise.

MOST INTERESTING character development and back stories.

LEAST sexual objectification of women

As a Black Trekkie, I've waited decades for this show to finally, boldly go where MOST previous series have not. Traditional Trekkies HATE to look at the banal racism of imagining a future where white supremacy still rules...to the extent that MOST species throughout the galaxy were portrayed by white people. That totally defies the core idea of the franchise, so a lot of, uhm, traditional Trekkies drown in denial about the Black Best Friends, esp TNG's LaForge and Guinan.

DISCO shows women in leadership, as scientists and villains. There are queer people, and people of color throughout so, as expected, there's major BACKLASH from traditional fans. Compare the diversity on the different bridges in TOS, TNG, VOY, ENT and you'll see why haters hate.",1 November 2020

Why does Michael Burnham have to be the that almost all the answers and almost always be the one to save the day in one way or another ?

Why didn't they just call the show Michael Burnham Crys Again.

"The idea is to go uphill not down hill. This show started out great. Intelligent dialogue and drama mixed with a proper and timely amount of weapons fire, excitement. The A. I. concept was cutting edge and thoughtful. Exciting even. Now it's hardly more than just another space soap opera with gooey romance and the mandatory women are better than men, except for maybe gay men or milquetoast philosophers. The absolutely inordinate amount of bang, crash, boom, explosions and errant weapons fire is inane. Season 4, episode 1 was incredibly lame with five minutes of out lovestruck heroes dodging laser fire which proved to be hardly more than cartoonish. Maybe I'll check in the rest of the way just for the laughs.

I thought Season 2 was dissapointing because I expect so much more from Star Trek, but I was still prepared to give Season 3 a chance. Season 3 made me want to throw up. It was the worst Star Trek by far and totally unwatchable even though I soldiered through to see if it would possibly improve. As the episodes continued it got worse and worse with the acting getting more and more crigeworthy as time went on. I cannot believe they are attempting a Season 4.

"Where do I start, or should it be when do I start? So last week I was house-sitting as my daughter and her boyfriend where taking a little deserved break. Of course the cats still need to be fed as does that silly tropical fish that lives a lonely live next to the sink. Makes anyone wonder... what does the fish think when it sees running water coming from the tap. Is it aware of the concept that one day - when its fishy existence has come to an end- it may be flushed through the sinkhole? Anyway - no pets were hurt during the writing of this piece of text! So, having done all the vacuum- cleaning etc. I decided it was time checking out the new Star Trek series on a media that was also somewhat unfamiliar to me: Netflix.

Having grown up with the original Star Trek series, having absolutely loved Star Trek The Next Generation and some of the other series - Star Trek Discovery is just that: discovery of how a great series can be destroyed! It seems the new generation of Trekkies doesn't understand what Star Trek is all about. I so agree with some of the other remarks, that it seems like yet another Transformers nonsense series. No depth, average actors, and all kept alive with nice special effects (hence the 3 out of 10).

Star Trek is and has never been about fighting silly ""Star Wars"" wars. Star Trek is indeed about discovery and science, about exploring the unknown. And since when does a complete race, like the Klingons change their appearance overnight?

Argh... as a Trekkie I will still watch the new series, but deep down inside I know with 100% certainty that this is not what Gene Roddenberry had in mind.

"This covers the first two episodes only:

This is the most beautiful train wreck I have ever seen... but it still is a train wreck.

If you can get over an overuse of dutch angles, lens flares and don't expect much science in your fiction, it is a nice romp, but it isn't surely what most fans of the previous shows want. If I had to guess, this was originally intended as a TV show in the J. J. Abrams universe - it just feels like it. That being said, the visuals are stunningly beautiful and look like they belong in a movie. Star Trek: Discovery is downright the most amazing looking show I have seen. I don't even mind if the Klingons look different or that the aesthetics have changed.

However, apart from 'looking good' this series has little to offer. There isn't much story to find here, just one or two plot points happening intermingled with a series of flashbacks, half-way decent action scenes and CGI. It's something that feels like it would have been relegated to a pre-title scene in any other show. The little bits of plot Star Trek: Discovery has often times don't make much sense (or things outright 'shouldn't work that way') and most scenes seems to be constructed to show off how 'awesome' the main character (and the captain) is.

If one would tell me that the entire thing started out as a moderately entertaining fan-fiction - complete with Mary Sue-self- insert - I wouldn't be surprised. I couldn't connect with any of the characters, not Michael, not the Captain, not the Klingon Warchief. All other characters have already faded away from my memory - except Lt. Saru... and the ""Daftpunkian"".

( Seriously, what was that? I am more interested in what that robot in the background was, than how the story continues. )

However, I really hope this show improves as it goes on.",26 September 2017
"I rarely find time off to rate an imdb entry. This one is noteworthy.

Since the pandemic i have been binging on ST generations, ST the original 60's series and this is by far the most solid for me in terms of story writing.

I have found complaints about ""this not being start trek"" and what not but i'd strongly suggest to give it at least a chance. This is a very fresh take on the series and revives awe for the viewer. Acting is great, special effects are for me epic, story line superb. It has a unique formula that makes repeatability of the story sensible. Will let you watch to find out.

Lastly, if we are so closed minded in the ST franchise, i'd suggest revisiting the original series. While i respect trekkies out there, in my head the 60's are far the worst. They treat female casts as objectifies sex symbols almost across the series. Regardless of its originality, i'm thankful i found this reboot and regained my respect back to following the ST series: binge order: ST, Next gen, ST original (60's)- dropped off , ST DISCOVERY.

"Love it. Hate it. Accept it. This is Star Trek. More precisely: An inevitably imperfect mirror of the divisive behaviour of our species along with its many triumphs and failures in our ongoing collective need to seek connection with ""the new"" without sacrificing our ties to ""the old.""

Some may call it cheesy, clumsy, or heavy-handed, but the core of DIscovery seemingly seeks to entertain and challenge us to ""reach"" for the strangeness of ""the other"" in our often clumsy attempts to understand ourselves, one another, or any other possible connection to our existence in spite of a nearly omnipresent fear of the unknown. It's a reminder to be brave enough to always question our boundaries and convictions.

"Dozens give Discovery a poor rating from 1 to 3 stars and bash on this series for it lacking on it's integrity to the concept and idea of Star Trek as a story and universe but also mostly based on the fact that it doesn't resemble the previous series.

Sure, I will admit there are some problems with certain aspects of factuality in the series and with it's writing... But overall this is an amazing prequel story to the following events of Enterprise etc.

Many people complain on the fact that this series is a ""Michael Burnham story"" rather than actual Star Trek... But I find these statements to be false and seriously ignorant. The fact that we follow the story of Michael Burnham as more of a lead with other characters in supporting roles isn't a bad thing.

The whole idea of this series is the evolving of situations and complications both personal and wider in the Star Trek universe. You just have to set your mind on the fact that all things revolving around Michael Burnham are just bridges connecting that lead to the future of the Federation and other species and coalitions respectively.

Yes, we do have a lot of the story focusing on Burnhams life but the fact is that whatever is going on with Burnham affects also those around her. Including Spock and his future... and past.

Overall this is a series which pleases both visually and story wise. Stop comparing Discovery with other series' and enjoy it and the extensive story it gives us from before the ""main events"" of Kirk, Picard etc.

Also for those who complain on the Discovery's shining and advanced looking tech. Remember. This is a new series with a lot more potential on making everything look more futuristic than there was with series' from the 20th century and at the very beginning of the 21st... Technology advances with each year that goes by in real life which obviously will affect the outlook of tech within more modern series' as well! And ALSO if someone does happen to wonder how there are so many new kinds of gadgets and what-not's in Discovery when comparing with Enterprise, you need to notice that the events of Discovery actually happen around 2250... Just in case someone isn't aware.",16 April 2020

"After watching the first four episodes, I was surprised to see so many negative reviews! A fan since forever with multiple watching of TOS, the prequels and sequels and movies (including the odd numbered movies) and as any fan, hungry for another Trek, I signed up with All Access with anxious hope. Personally, I wasn't disappointed. Curious though, on how Discovery is going to dampen the tech to allow the continuity to Enterprise.(Black Alert?) Somehow make instant bio-gene travel illegal because of universe contamination? The characters somehow don't fit with Starfleet's typical, but are still fresh and interesting with Capt. Lorca allowing debate, Michael marching to her own drummer and Saru's internal conflicts regarding Michael. For those who have only watched the first episode before fully discounting our new Trek, I encourage you to suspend a bit more dis- belief and give Discovery another chance. Hey!

"Let me clear this out the door, I am not a star trek fan. So I believe you would find my views objective.

Star trek discovery has been great at portraying the various sci-fi aspects of space-time continuum to get there story out. But the main aspect of this series, I believe, doesn't go round the science. For me, the main star around which the story revolves are the ravages our humanity has already endured, and according to this series, will continue to endure.

The handling of various relationships has been excellent as well. Be it the political, professional or the personal ones, the amount of empathy that is shown in the series is obviously an ideal that is missing from the real world. If only people could take inspiration from these kind of series (instead of the violent and twisted ones) the world could have been the most beautiful in the galaxy.",27 January 2022
"I was euphoric when Discovery was announced. The well had been dry for ages and my copies of Voyager, DS9, TNG were almost worn out from being replayed so much.

Season 1 was dark, gritty, action-packed. The combination of Burnham, Georgiou, Lorca, Pike (in no particular order) was fantastic.

With season 2 + 3 my interest started to fade. Too many touchy-feely fast-forwardable moments with Burnham, too much Burnham in general, and the whole thing felt like a soap opera between Burnham, Tilly, Stamets & Culber.

Now cue Season 4 which has gone full gonzo on the LGBTQIA+ and all but done away with men. It's just way too intentional and I can only feel like CBS is trying to re-gain political capital lost elsewhere, or just cover its corporate social responsibility for the next decade.

As a gay man myself, I thought Pike was hot, and he kept the show true to its canon. Now I feel like Discovery has become a hot dramatic mess of gender and sexuality and I'm just about ready to stop watching. It's just too much.

"I am a great fan of Star Trek. While I deeply loved TNG it took me a while to get used to DS9 and Voyager but learned to love them equally. Same with this new series. Took me two episodes to dig into it. First I thought it is too much action and implicitly compared it to the TNG- diplomacy. Also the new Klingon-look was a little strange in the beginning. But despite all the new things I had to adapt to, it grew on me. Just watched the last episode and hate to wait until January. Honestly, it is a great show and in my opinion it deserves much a better rating than 7.3. It is foolish to compare it to the old stuff because the setting of the story doesn't really allow the scientific exploring of the universe when it is all about winning the war against Klingons. But also I hope for some filler episodes for the future... last episode about ""parallel universes"" keeps me believing.",13 November 2017

Sorry, but the old Trekkies finally have to adapt to modern TV entertainment. I watched the series together with my dad (62, Trekkie since he was a child) and me (27, Trekkie due to my fathers passion). We both are thrilled by the new series (btw: watching on Netflix in Germany, no idea about what CBS is doing in the US).

Star Trek has to develop to attract new viewers. With the old way of story-telling u cannot convince modern audience. U may seduce hard- core fans but not viewers, who are nowadays used to brilliant story- telling.

My dad knows the new quality of good series and nowadays he is even sometimes bored by watching his old favorites like TNG or Voyager. U need to have good story-telling, interesting characters (and actors) and yes: some action at least! I think u will all find that in Discovery.

Oh and about all the hate towards the new Klingons: u really think that u could impress new viewers by the old look of the Klingons? seriously? I like the new Klingons!

But yes, I agree: A new series would be better off in the future (timeline-wise).

Season 3 was watchable, but it began going down the drain bit by bit.

Season 4 just continues with what season 3 was doing wrong, which is sacrificing the overall story to focus on a few characters that have only been inserted into the show because they have a certain self-assigned ""gender"" in real life.

Show be damned, story be damned, lets just tick off some boxes to gain good points with the woke crowd with characters that are so out of touch with Star Trek and that have no evolving story around them.

They should just focus on other characters instead, ones that are actually a part of the crew and perform important tasks, but no...

I loved seeing Michael's growth as she finds her place in the Star Trek universe.

Tilly is so lovable and sweet.

I was glued to the tv and have watched all the seasons over again before starting the new season. I will be doing the same for the next season.",31 December 2022
"I will first talk about the positive or neutral things so here it goes: I personally quite like the look of the show. I fully understand that, although the show takes place before TOS, they had to update the technology a bit because TOS technology would mostly be outdated even by today's standards. I also enjoyed the current Star Trek movies from a visual point of view but I guess that all comes down to your own personal taste and you can make up your own mind about that just by looking at a trailer. Now to all the bad stuff: It's not Star Trek. It simply isn't. This show would even feel odd in a Mirror Universe episode. I'm not sure if we are actually supposed to like anyone in this new crew because I certainly don't. The Star Trek of old gave us a crew that worked as a team to explore the Universe and to better humanity. This crew, however, seems to constantly work against each other for no apparent reason other than their own individual egos. The final straw is the main character. I don't think anyone would disagree with me here when I say that she is pretty much Mary-Sueing her way through the first 4 episodes. She constantly outperforms everybody in their own special discipline and somehow expects the audience to feel pity because nobody likes her. There are far better shows out there if you just want to watch a drama with backstabbing A**holes because you certainly won't be faced with any thought-provoking Sci-Fi or ethical questions in STD (fitting abbreviation by the way).",16 October 2017
"Great show thus far. Don't let the people who are angry about it not being Star Trek enough scare you off. Keep an open mind and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. I love most of the other Star Trek shows and I understand that if that's what you're expecting then you might be disappointed, but this is a great show on its own and it's about time Star Trek stepped into the next generation........*wink*",17 October 2017
"This is an artistic endeavor. They have re-imagined the Klingons pre-first series and they are feeling free to utilize up-to-date tech for the sets. Why can't you trekkers open up your minds? It's so sad. No, CBS hasn't paid me anything. I'm a Canadian who first discovered Star Trek the original series as a child. What I always loved is how it transported me for an hour into new worlds. We need to bear in mind that STNG was best television ever created - that's a pretty high standard to live up to. But to me, this new series does the franchise justice, updated for a new millennium. The story line about the spore drive is fascinating and ENTIRELY new. I'm sorry that you have a pay wall and so most of you couldn't get past the second episode. If you did, then you'd understand that they ARE going where nobody has gone before. So what if the lead character has a male name? I find a lot of the negative reviews here are petty, silly, and fixated on small non-relevant details. Look farther. That's what Gene would have wanted you to do.",24 November 2017
Simply put. I love this reboot of the Star Trek franchise. As Silvia Tilly said in an episode in the first season 'this is so f$&king cool!',22 March 2019
"In any reincarnation of an iconic series there will be haters.

Discovery is another a Great series, even if you are not a Star Trek geek, just treat it as a SciFi series. Who knows it may inspire you to watch other Star Trek series!!",7 May 2022
"The first season was barely tolerable. The second season got a bit better, mostly by adding the Pike and 🖖 characters (the ridiculous ret-conning aside). Season 3 and 4 were pure garbage.

Hoping ""Strange New Worlds"" is a better offering.",18 March 2022
"Started out a bit shaky but it's found a footing, now I'm hanging out for season 3.",28 April 2020
"TOS, next generation, deep space nine, Voyager, and Enterprise are all valuable editions of the franchise. But they have all at one time suffered the wrath of the supposed Original Trekkies at one time or another. I guess I would be considered Next Generation as that is the show that I watched every single week. I remember DS9 before it started and the Original Trekker crying out loudly ""No ship, what the hell? They are ruining everything! No captain! No... to go boldly!!!"" Oh how they despised the idea. And none of them will owe up to it now.... none will owe up to hating Picard for being Older and more of a thinking man's hero.... or even complaining about him being bald. I remember Reruns of Original Trek. (Don't make the mistake of calling it Old Trek) but my Mum is an original trekkie she shared Trek with me when I was maybe 5 by giving me her set of original megos' to play with.... which upset my Father to know end... in his view they looked like barbie dolls. Oh how times have changed. Yet there is still this gnashing of the supposed Uber Fan who consistantly bashed all version of trek that does not measure up in their small and limited understanding of what Trek is.... I submit to you all the start of original Trek. The mission statement if you will of all versions of Trek past present and future. ""To boldly go where no .... one has gone before."" I have brought a new generation into the fold of Trek and I can tell you if Roddenberry hadn't evolved and changed that single word of ""man"" into the word ""one"" my daughter would not have her ""Trek"" Trek is about bringing others along for the ride. To see how their minds open and expand when they see Trek for real the very first time. Like my wife who after 6 years of marriage actually watched a few episodes and exclaimed ""oh this show is good, I thought it would be boring the way everyone talks about it."" We are boldly going into 20 years of marriage now. And although I would say shes a trekkie she is willing to detour and trek along now and has fun doing it. Trek is about the Discovery of who we are with each other. It is about learning from our mistakes in the past and letting them guide us to our future. Trek is evolution from one generation to the next, and closing that Deep space that separates us all. Because when we voyage together we are better, stronger, kinder, and our further Enterprises will always be more rich and worth sharing. Yes changes have been made to TOS, but I say to you all. If my Mum can learn to accept Kirk instead of Pike, then we can allow that audiences require a show considered Science Fiction to update special effects and integrate our science as we know it and what we dream and expect it to be to push Trek into the future so it does not suffer that place in the attic for the Old shows that even true fans don't watch because they filmed it on a budget cheaper then most kids spend on lunch. No trek is kept alive because it is always reinventing itself and growing beyond itself, after all isn't that what dreams are supposed to do? So watch Discovery for one reason, entertainment done well and stick around for the Trek afterwards. You might be amazed at how much fun it really is. What other show being made currently with new episodes every week can offer you that? So disgruntled Trekkies out there... try living up to the ideals you claim, and tred carefully, unless of course your goal is to get Trek gone again... it worked on Enterprise.. and most of you regretted it afterwards wondering where it might of lead... this is the second chance you wanted without the time travel. If unhappy with the direction be constructive it worked for some Next gen fans who changed the show forever by becoming writers for the show.... and if you want a show to savagely bash... well I could say anything not Trek shows loyalty but to get the bachelor off the air shows true strength and honor only a Klingon could have and the unequivocal logic equaled only by Vulcans themselves. So thank you for reading and look forward to many more seasons of Trek in the future, after all when no trek is on T.V. trekkies seem more lost than ever. NASA renamed a shuttle because of trekkies.... before the internet people. What other fan base has that kind of power? Live long and prosper my people!",18 February 2019
"Show does a great job of incorporating Star Trek technology to entertain its viewers. Some of it shouldn't be in the show but without it the excitement Star Trek fans are usually use to our interest would be lost, and we would be forced to watch another crew of dullards (Sorry ENTERPRISE) learning from their mistakes. Fans don't want another show like that one. This one will modernize the current Star Trek fan. If you've watched the show for a few episodes and haven't researched at least one scientist & his Tedex video YOU are not a Star Trek fan. Hold on to your seat folks, and get your own tribble. This one is mine!",20 October 2017
I don't understand all the negative Reviews. But for me this the best Star Trek Seasons! Every Episode really epic. Thankyou!,6 November 2020
"The designers and writers have done an outstanding job bringing Star Trek up to date. I never though I would say this as a die-hard old Trekkie, but, Star Trek: Discovery's Producers, writers, designers and other staff have captured the very essence of the Star Trek I knew as a child. I sit in anticipation of the next episode. I have fallen in love all over again! :)",23 October 2017
"Horrible first episode. you don't root for any of the characters. this is not the vibe of star trek at all. First episode was an all black cast. As if that wasn't noticeable. The original Star Trek could have cared less about color or if you were an alien, etc.

This isn't even a good knock off of Lost in Space.",19 October 2020
"I find that this series is a refreshing change to all the Star Trek series, showing more of the emotional and personal angles of the adventures. It has grown from the battles and excitement from fighting that has always been part of the realm, and, has become a very lovely story to be a part of as a viewer.",24 January 2021
"Alex Kurtzman on his 5 season mission to boldly puke the weirdest wokeness ideas and exceptional bad writing directly into the audiences face!

Everything in this so called ""Star Trek"" is wrong. The people who wrote and designed this had just no idea what they are doing.

Season 3 was exceptionally bad and dumb, with a lot of crying and hugging. They completely broke with the canon and legacy. They obviously wanted to impose the audience their completely distorted worldview and apparently wanted to bore those to death with bad writing, who have noticed this due to a bit of residual intelligence. It was just to endure with a lot of fast forwarding.

And in season 4 they yet raised it - against all resistance - to another level. I'm done with this show.

You get 2 stars for SFX and filming. That's it.",8 March 2022
"But I do. If you want star trek, you kinda gotta accept that it evolves every generation. Some people have a problem with snark. I find it refreshing. I'm not a purist and I like the show. I've been watching star trek my whole life and I feel like though this may be a different feel of star trek, it's a good one. I like the cast, I like the story, I like the characters, I like the screenplay and i like the acting.

Idk what else to say about it. I feel like the only people who don't like it are the people who get mad when a book is different from a movie. I'm not one of those people. It seems way less fun to be one of those people.",22 June 2021
"Many trekkies were outraged with Star Trek: The Next Generation upon release. It was too different. It didn't live up to their expectations of what Star Trek should be. Roddenberry, himself, made writers incessantly frustrated by his demands that the crew must always get along. The result was a a bland formulaic narrative where the crew of The Enterprise encounters an alien species, Kirk tells them what's wrong with their society and then they move on. So many great story ideas were neglected, as they didn't fit into Roddenberry's tight structure.

Gene Roddenberry came up with a fantastic ideal for the future. Star Trek: Discovery still has that ideal, but it is populated with flawed humans who are continuously struggling to live up to that ideal. They believe in it, but they have a hard time reconciling that with their nature.

I love the re-imagining of the Klingons (and I really don't care about continuity). It's exciting! It makes them appear much more alien and incomprehensible. Also, you get their side of the conflict, which is basically, ""We're not going to give up our identity for your Federation conformity.""

The storytelling is absolutely compelling. It unfolds beautifully and is taken into wild directions. If Roddenberry were still alive and overseeing this reincarnation of his original work, it would be so much lesser. He was a great idealist, but a terrible storyteller.",10 January 2018
"I have watched all Star Trek TNG, Voyager and DS9 seasons,a few original series episodes with Kirk and Spock at helm and all recent movies. Frankly, I do not understand all the hate from the supposed ST fanboys.I was a kid during TNG and I thought at the time how fascinating was the technology, the ship, Data, the adventures, the utopia of a progressive, egalitarian Federation co-existing with the other alien societies...

Well, I cannot watch it anymore as an adult without laughing. It's worse for the original series. Fake cardboard sets, plastic industrial buttons, silly camera movements, demure and submissive women everywhere etc. Sure, at the time of their release,these shows were OK. Now, their technology and design of technology look outdated considering the current FUNCTIONAL tablets, research into flexible, foldable screens, medical technology, nanotechnology, new materials...You cannot have that old make believe in the new series. It will never work.

Please, no more DNA sequencing machines displaying crappy, cartoon depictions of DNA macro molecules and their supposed mutations and other pseudo-scientific nonsense. Nowadays, we have those machines.

Worse, times have changed, for better or for worse.The world we're living in is darker, raw and unfiltered because we know more about our world thanks to the internet-famine in Africa and Asia, armed conflicts on at least too continents, flu pandemics every few years, cholera in Yemen, resurgence of poliomyelitis and so on... What is socially acceptable has also changed. Sure, ST it was all about escapism to a better place. Yet, the method was lacking. It glossed over and romanticized the essentially sophisticated yet flawed human psyche and its influence on human actions.Bigotry, unpredictability, eccentricity, volatility, envy, entitlement, callousness, gluttony, ignorance etc are part of human nature. They will never go away.

I am glad to see a different, more realistic take on the human characters and a proper reflection of the times we're living in Star Trek Discovery. I am an avid reader of hard science sci-fi and perhaps I am a bit biased. However,if you like glossy, cartoon sci-fi and camp, silly humor- head straight to Orville. If you like a more serious take on future technology, alien cultures, human inner conflicts in decision making, you might like Discovery.",13 October 2017
"I loved this. All three episodes so far kept me captivated and craving more. To all the nay sayers out there, keep up with the times. Watching the episodes felt like watching a movie with the amazing camera views, the acting from Michael made you feel her emotions, the storyline is great. I am a firm supporter of this show 110%.",7 October 2017

Was sad to read they've renewed for a fifth season, after the four we've already been put through.",20 March 2022
"Finally got to watch season 4 of Disco. Wow just wow. What an emotional rollercoaster with twists and turns I couldn't guess. The plot, acting, VFX, production and overall deployment of all the working pieces was a masterpiece to me. Rolling crescendos of sub plots all coming to a collective tsunami was amazing to witness. The commitment from the casts and all working behind the scenes was evident. A lot of great acting from all involved. Tarkas character had me seesawing from seeing his point of view and agreeing with him to seeing that he was an absolute asshole about 3 to 4 times is such a quick succession I was starting to second guess my judge of character (I'm a good one I think lol). A lot of great anchors acting wise from Book, Tarka, Michael and Saru. But in whole ALL the actors involved were able to shine with great performances. A true oddity and rarity to see such a cohesive and ""on board"" cast. Character building, writing, editing all top notch in my opinion. Rarely was I not engaged with the plot(even though I'm pretty sure I have decent amount of A. D. D.). I felt like I was watching what was happening in another universe to all of these characters/actors as if it was actually them; albeit in a different universe/timeline.

The sheer intelligence incorporated into an also emotionally charged plot is what has me hooked. Bravo cast, writers, directors, producers etc all those involved.",1 May 2023
I actually liked the first two episodes it wasn't the fastest moving but it has potential to get better.I still think 'Enterprise' was the worst series. I know it is the most modern so a lot of special effects but that isn't a bad thing. If you view it as a totally new star trek story and not a continuation of other star treks it promises to be quite gripping,29 September 2017
"I love this show so far. I like all the characters, especially their irreverence. And, this show's seeming irreverence. Finally a Star Trek that feels like real people in typical Star Trek impossible situations. They cuss, they are silly, and wrestle with their own beingness. I have liked most of the other Star Trek television shows, but this one appeals to me the most. So, it figures that it would get a slew of butthurt, Star Trek purists who hate it. The main character is not the most interesting to me, they really never are. The other characters take turns delighting me in the arcs they go through. This is by far my favorite ST show so far. Well, not counting TOS when I was a kid.",3 February 2020
"the best star trek show ever.....I enjoy every episode. Michael Burnham is excellent. I find many of the earlier shows pretty ridiculous and boring, so I may not be a real ""trekky"". I feel the same for many of the Star Wars movies btw - they are just too childish to catch me. But I am a huge sci-fi fan, and this show is just great in any way.",28 November 2017
"Although I initially did not like Star Trek discovery veryuch, I have to admit that it seems the producers áre in fact trying accommodate the more die-hard fans like myself.

I'll admit that even at the end of season 2 there are still some hard to swallow bits, like the time crystals, Burnham's time suit and Discovery's rotating saucer, and the shape of the warp nacelles of this so-called era.

But, I do like the re-imagined technology on the ships, I mean, in the 60's the original series was ""Wow"", it was meant to be. I would expect to be ""Wowed"" again with a new Star Trek series, I mean, with the technological advances we've made since then I really do not want to think that the fiter is gonna take a step back into the past, and Discovery does that remarkably well. The bridge observation window/screen with polarisation effect, love it! I mean why send people out if your gonna use sensors to see everything anyway, right? I remember a scene in TNG where Capt. Picard sends Cmdr. Riker to ""get a real look"" from a window - which the bridge didn't have.

And the new Enterprise! She's a beaut. Finally a TOS version with actual weapons hard point! Thank you for that! It's the main reason I never liked the original. I hope they keep firing from them though and don't star making weapons fire from just anywhere like in TNG where phasers started firing from the torpedo tubes.

Good job Discovery, you're redeeming yourself! Keep it up.",20 April 2019
"Made it only half way through season 4. Each seasons is worse than the last. The writing is terrible and acting is not much better. Now in its 4th season they are doing stuff that should have been done in the 1st season and only the first few episodes. The characters should have evolved way pass this by the 4th season but they are de-evolving to bumbling idiots. They are out of the academy and have been in the field for at least 4 years and they cant even hold a weapon with out dropping it nor do the simplest of tasks. Just garbage TV, I suggest watching anything else, there are so many good tv shows that this one can be easiest missed.",31 March 2022
"I'm a long standing Start Trek fan and have watched literally every Star Trek rendition from the films to TV series, from TOS to Star Trek Enterprise...

The biggest criticism I'm getting from most people - it isn't exactly like the original series so therefore isn't the worst thing ever...

The uniforms were different (FYI it's technically a science vessel), the Klingons looked different (although eerily similar to how they made them appear in the recent rebooted film franchise), and so on and so fourth...

And this is what is tilting me, people either complain because its not exactly like how it was - so betraying the original legacy OR they did do it exactly the same - and therefore is boring and lacks original ideas:

Same as original - no originality/no new ideas/Boring Different from original - no continuality/betrayal of legacy/ 'not what I'm used to'

In short, people hate either how it stays the same or hate how it has changed.

Now there is no doubt in my mind that Gene Roddenberry was a mind blowing genius, and his legacy is one of the greatest in sci-fi history. That said, in order for his franchise to continue you have to let other people put their own twist on it, even though it may deviate from the re-runs of star trek that you've watched a million times...

Anyway, as for STD, let's break it down concisely: Acting wise - no worse or better than any other series they released - with exception to the brilliant acting of Patrick Stewart which I don't think anyone is ever going to be able to surpass. Generally though, the acting was good and believable. Story line - For me personally, I thought it was brilliant (hence 9 rating), a fascinating insight to the Klingon/Federation war, the religious background of the Klingons, and a fast paced story-line that made you desperate to watch the next episode. They even did quite a few of mind blowing wonders that GR loved to fill star trek with... Honoring of the Star Trek Legacy - this is probably the area where I can understand why the true fan critics come into force - there are some notable deviations from the original series. Uniforms and Klingon appearance are the biggest gripes - as stated before see the above. I didn't massively like the uniforms, but I did like the Klingon appearance... I guess personal tastes come in...

Anyway, I think I want to end on the most important thing about Star Trek... I want it to keep going and inspire the next generation, much like how it did for me growing up... No new rendition of Star Trek is going to be Voyager, DS9, TNG, TOS, etc, but at least it is a rendition that IMO is actually pretty fun and interesting to watch...

Peace out everyone!",12 November 2018
"I can see why many Trekkies hate this new format, it's completely different from every other series we've had previously. Yes, each series from the original through to TNG and Voyager brought their own twist, but they were all essentially the same. Apart from Voyager there hasn't been any real ongoing storyline that really forms the structure of any series to date. Here we have a completely new style where you can't sit and watch a single episode on a lazy afternoon, or pick up the story halfway through, and it's a refreshing change. You can't just have the same thing over and over again, times change.

The social complexities of this series are far more realistic, but I grant they do squash the social ideals that were originally intended for the Star Trek franchise. I can see why many people found comfort with this idea of a society where they could fit in without having to consider going to parties or get involved with social situations they probably strive to avoid in real life.

It's interesting to see how we'd handle ourselves in the future with a social construct that's more realistic. Ultimately, the crew have gone from getting excited over the thought of free time to research some unpronounceable science theory, to wanting a drink and dancing at s party in the mess hall.",28 January 2018

"I've watched every episode of Discovery and it gets better and better. It took me 5 years to like DS9, and I already love this show. And I go back to the original series era. Without giving away spoilers, there's already been (in 8 episodes): 1. saving a sentient species 2. redemption for the fallen 3. a continuing of the diversity we expect from Star Trek in terms of relationships 4. characters going through trials that test and define who they think they are.

and many other things that define real Star Trek.",4 November 2017
"This is show that has all the bad tropes from bad late 2010s TV shows. The protagonists are inconsistent, illogical (even when praised for their supposed logic), prone to violent outburst and generally unlikable.The antagonists are equally illogical and the whole physical universe around them are government by no natural laws that recognizable from our universe. Light travels instantaneously across galaxies, starships operate as if space has higher friction than water, and sunflares are EVERYWHERE.",8 April 2018
Star Trek was thought of something that had been done and was just a fond many for many of us. This show has put Star Trek back on the map and unlike other shows which have come out of the woodwork to bleed what little bit they can out of a franchise. I've watched Star Trek since as long as I can remember over 30 years. Cannot wait for section 31 as I'm a Philippa Georgiou fanatic! I also like the central plot to the season which is a way the show has adapted to the modern shorter seasons 12/13 episodes. Instead of the episodic previous shows,23 January 2021
"** Guess all the 1 and 2 stars below me must come from the same few persons with dubble accounts **

To me it's a nice show and i'm happy there is a star trek show again after so many years. Yes it's different than we used to but it has something fresh to it.

I'm liking the story so far it's pretty good written and it has good acting in it. Hopefully more seasons will come!",15 January 2018
"I am loving this show because it presents itself as a good sci-fi, it has really nice plot-twists and I find that peace between cultures and military ethics are very interesting subjects.

I never watched anything related to Star Trek before, and I came here looking for recommendations of other Star Trek shows or movies, but from what I've seen here, I figured that Star Trek fans are probably toxic and easily angered so I changed my mind. I'm gonna use Wikipedia instead of asking them, it's not as good as personal recommendations but at least an online encyclopedia can't be pedantic and condescending.",26 January 2018

"I tried to suffer through this series, just can't do it anymore. The storyline and effects are good.

"I'm a long time Star Trek fan and I can't explain all these negative reviews. I found this series as close to perfect as you can expect from a show aiming to please a wide and varied audience.

Anybody saying this isn't Star Trek is living in the past and/or focusing on the wrong things imo. The crew is all about federation values and the plot is still nerdy enough to satisfy the hardcore fans. The only difference is a greater continuity of plot, and a little more grit than previous series, which I actually prefer.

It would have been nice if they focused a little more on some of the lower ranked crew members a little more. Plus most the Klingon scenes in the first season dragged a little but otherwise it's very hard to criticise the show.

I can't wait for season 4!",13 January 2021
"There's a lot of focus on emotions, that's a change... great! Storylines expand single episodes..that's new...great! At times the dialog seems quirky/real...love it The CGI is amazing

Even though the main focus is on one (three?) main character, over time we do get to know the crew and you are starting to feel their bond.

Not a huge fan of the parallel universe theme, seems a bit corny, but I think we moved on from that ;)

Still very much look forward to the next episode every time...this is working for me!

PS Christopher Pike (Anson Mount) should really have a spinoff series/movie He was a great bridge between old school Star trek and the new one",28 December 2020
"Reading all the 1 star reviews I would have never watched this in the beginning. The truth is a lot of what they criticise the series for you could criticise the original Star Trek for. Discovery feels more like that than say next generation, it feels more gritty with more depth which for me it made it more engaging. The flaws so many describe like Michael being wooden are part of the show a human raised by vulcans would be.

Discovery stands on its own the plot twists and bends. Having watched both seasons; the second is definitely the best. The second seemed more coherent in its flow. Ultimately discovery offers a inspiring vision of the future like all other incarnations of Star Trek. The bringing that vision to the current generation offering a heroic vision of the future in which humanity can solve its problems through ingenuity and resolute persistence.",19 April 2019
"How can anyone on the crew focus when the red alert siren never stops? I have to mute the show and enable closed captions just to be able to watch the show.

Anyone remember Encounter at Farpoint?

Immediately, PICARD says: Shut off that damned noise.

I love the tech in this series...the black alert jumps are awesome.

There is lack of meaningful social interactions between the crew. These episodes seem to lack a sense of humor, not being funny, but being joyful sometimes just as a casual interactions between the crew. It feels like everything on the show is a problem to solve.

I guess my last criticism is the bridge always seems to be on fire, like there's that countdown to the zero second before the entire ship blows up and they're able to pull everything out at the last second.",17 November 2022
"Wow. It's not 1960. Get a life or a time machine.

I never ever ever ever ever write reviews. But I knew this would get panned and I have been a Trek fan all my life. I worked on a Trek Documentary back in 2002, met everyone involved. They're all great and super talented and they would never get it wrong on purpose. But there's no pleasing some people.

The main drive of this series is the sheer reverence for GR's tiny little two season show. I love the sub-titled Klingon's speech, which adds massively to the depth of content. The spore drive, multi-dimensional time dilemmas, and mind-melds. A wonky captain, excellently acted. And the star has enough character to last twenty seasons. Seriously; what more do you want?

"This is a brilliant re-imagining of the franchise. We have had many series sticking to the old format, and as much as we love those, it is time for a change. This series is brilliant and worth anyone's time. The show increases the pace a little, but not too much. The story continues from episode to episode which increases a sense of engagement in the story. It is touching on new ground for Star Trek. It has made Klingons scary again.",9 October 2017
"I can understand people being upset or let down by this series. But in all honesty, if you can allow yourself to see past the older versions and embrace the new content they are trying to tell in their story, it's fantastic. Above average actors, a good representation of all kinds of people from different walks of life, and something that really captures your interest and leaves you wanting more.

Anyone looking for a sci-fi binge-a-thon, I reccomend checking it out for yourself. Open-mindedness for the lovely die hard fans out there will really help you enjoy it more too.

Thanks to the creators for their capacity to entertain and keep me on the edge of my seat while falling in love with each and every character.

P.s. If you enjoyed voyager, I'm sure you won't be disappointed in discovery. Happy watching, everyone 😊",8 January 2022
"Adira and co are ruining this show, acting and teeth are terrible and seems to be spending a lot of time talking about feelings and not so much space exploration.",23 December 2021
My first time ever watching any Star Trek.Finished season 1 and starting 2 and I'm really loving the show,4 July 2020
Gene would be dissappionted. Bad sci-fi overall. Trying to hard to make political statements. Gene had a way of breaking barriers...Discovery just breaks decent storytelling.,14 December 2018
"I will admit that it took a minute to adjust to the new tone. I am loving the development of the characters, the story, the unfolding of the plot...it's been wonderful to see.

The casting was well done and kudos for the special effects. I appreciate that the writers have managed to update the technology and I also appreciate the development of a more rough Federation. I had always wondered what led the Federation to become the society of tolerance that it is.

It is Star Trek. I am happy it is back.",23 October 2017
"Original storyline, good acting and beautifully displayed. Startrek has left the poorly and fake looking sets from older series behind. Stories contain a bit more action then older series, all for the better.",12 May 2019
Just finished watching the second season. Thoroughly enjoyed the show so far. The first had too many subtitles for the Klingons the second too many tears and monologues but overall better than Enterprise,19 April 2019
"As a TNG/VOY/DS9 fan, I really disliked the new movies. These first three episodes are actually very reminiscent of some VOY episodes.

The ""Klingon"" however, are not at all like the Klingons of TNG. Granted TOS Klingon were also very different, but in this case I feel many of the changes were unnecessary.

That being said, I still very much enjoyed it, and if you're like me and can put aside the Klingon weird (almost meek) tone of voice in contrast to the old, fierce Klingon speech, so will you.",8 October 2017
"In the next season, for the love of God, don't whisper so much. It's not interesting and does not project intensity. It's just lazy writing, directing and act.",22 May 2022
I love the high octane action and huge stakes. I don't need another reheated TNG series. I love the new flavour of Discovery!,19 November 2020
"What a wasted opportunity this show was, look at the budget.....!!!!

They could have had many interesting plot lines with the Klingons, the wars, philosophical conundrums, new worlds which could be brought to life with special effects... nope, we get yet another dragged out boring plot line written with such ineptness it's not even funny.

Say goodbye to philosophy and intelligent thought. We're going to make this show just like a PC Star Wars even though that's not really what anyone wants. Say goodbye to likable characters. We're going to spend time with a Mary Sue, emasculated men, and pale, pudgy, pimply swearing babes. Honestly though, why was this show R-rated? Why do we need Star Trek with graphic violence and swearing? If this is 'updating it for modern times' maybe it's high time we altered our modern times permanently to be more like how it was when the good Star Trek shows were being produced. I admit I didn't watch very much of this show but I feel no need to continue.

Side Note: Making Klingons into Trump supporters was a corny but intriguing idea, but the show's creators wasted that also. All the Klingons do is growl and act savage and you suddenly realize it's all just another agenda giving the show creators opportunity to rail against politics they don't like. What the heck. When the Klingons were based off Soviet Union leaders they were treated fairer than this.",5 May 2020
"In a world of huge franchises, re-boots and nostalgic homages, it's good to see something daring being made. The fact that most ""i'm a huge fan but this is crap"" fans are so out of sorts shows a direction that draws out their xenophobia and need to klingon(sorry, had to) to the past. Having gone through dozens of reviews with one truly apparent fact, most people who hate the show haven't made it past the second episode. Ya gotta love an open mind and quizzical nature, some would say, the essence of the Star Trek cannon. Some have said the diversity of actors used are 'shoe-horned' to fit a politically correctness agendum, get past the first few episodes and it's not the focus, the actors settle into the characters and there's some great story-telling to be enjoyed. My problem isn't with the show, it's compelling, i personally hope they make more and they don't suffer the same fate as Alien Nation, Firefly and Caprica ... all cancelled before their time and cult favourites long after their respective ends. It's this HATE HATE HATE mentality that comes from the inter-web void. ... one last thought for the 'true fans' banging on, the original series in 1966 was not well received either, it's major audience grew in numbers and social ideals after it's cancelation.",14 March 2018
This series are truly awesome thanks for the show~,18 November 2020
"I'm gonna simply put. That the ideologies of The Next Generation are slowly showing within this show. The basics of how people should be, instead of what they have become. The aspect of Star Trek was everything and everyone to be united. That is ""why"" I love this new series. It has potential. It has everything that Star Trek truly stands for.",30 November 2020
It's dark and twisty just like a new school sci-fi show.,2 March 2018
"Did I watch the same program as others that are giving this a one star and complaining? The show blew me away! Of course, I paid for CBS Access and have already watched the second episode so for those that complain of ""cardboard"" characters, give it a rest...it's the first episodes! I have quickly become invested in the backstory of Michael Burnham as well as the Klingons. And complaining about the CGI? Technology has changed so much over the last 50 years that what is available movie makers and TV directors/producers is so far advanced from the original series...even from the days of TNG, Enterprise, and the others. Enjoy the technical improvement instead of bashing it. Costumes and makeup are extraordinary. Acting is great, actors well chosen for their roles. And the more episodes filmed, the more we learn about characters...they flesh out. Actors become more comfortable in their roles and have more story line to work with to develop their backstories. (Don't believe me? Watch the first couple of episodes of TMG and observe how wooden the actors were in their roles but they grew in to them quickly). So if you find it unwachable? Don't bother to sign up for CBS All-Access. I hadn't planned to but it's worth the low cost of putting up with commercials just to watch this show every week.",19 October 2017
"I love the show although I find it difficult to understand the actor playing Booker its as if he has cotton or something in his mouth and his pronunciation comes out muffled and not enunciated clearly.

Effects, storyline, diversity and technical science plausibility is thankfully a great mix.",14 February 2022
"There has been a lot of negative reviews on IMDB, and I really felt compelled to share my experience with the serie. I believe the serie is great and that it captures the hart and soul of Star Trek.

I have been watching Star Trek ever since I was little, starting with Star Trek Enterprise, Jean Luc Picard was my hero. The series really resonated in me and triggered my curiosity. Lately I have been dissopointed in Star Trek, mainly because of the newer movies. They were action packed and centred around Earth. No more ´to boldly go where no man has gone before´. So I was really glad that there was a new serie coming.

The essence of this series for me is the exploring, the amazement and the difficult ethical and moral choices the crew has to make. They go into uncharted area´s literally and figuratively. They are brave and rise to the challenge, even though the odds are almost impossible and moreover they learn from all these experiences. I believe this series has all of these components, especially the second season which has a great overarching story. I am amazed and inspired again, I think the series for that.

Yes the serie has a ´slick´ feel to it. The cast is could be a little rougher around the edges or more of a ´normal´ beauty. And yes I also despised the difference in appearance of the Klingons, I later on came to appreciate it. Because frankly they look good and I like the many differences in nuances what seems to be fitting.

All together I am very happy with the series and I hope that they will continue on with it!",24 March 2019
"Trying to pass as an egalitarian showpiece but ends up as pretentious and condescending. The writers have a flair for the super dramatic with dialogue that is taken from a romance novel and a romcom movie.

The first season was barely tolerable but this latest one is just pure melodrama.

If not for the special effects and the sci-fi techno blabber I would not watch this show.",28 February 2022
I don't understand all the haters. I've been a star trek fan since the original series. And Discovery has managed to achieve that delicate balnce perfectly - keeping to star trek ideals and remaining relevant in 2021! Season 1 and 2 were good but S3 is excellent. To all those stuck in the past - rather stay away from any new star trek series!,4 February 2021
"After reading a lot of reviews on here, I decided to check the new star Trek out. It kept me entertained and after the first episode I wanted to know more.... the problem is clear - although under the Star Trek banner it will struggle as there are to many fans out there who need to step out side their front doors and take note it's 2017. It is what it is another story, another set of characters with all in one star trek uniforms on.

I have read that some people can't understand why the ship has so much tech when it's ten years before kirk Hello????? It it was single flashing lights and a load of plastic bits stuck together then people would moan.....

Please give this a chance and stop the rubbish being written ..... it's good!",30 September 2017
"My wife and I were VERY disappointed with the first season, my wife refused to watch season two. I have to say that they really improved season two, I am looking forward to season three now. I still don't like the new Klingons",7 November 2019
"Wow! so much negativity from ""fans"". I remember when this type of negativity was aimed at TOS when it first came out. I actually like the disfunctionality of Disco. Set in the timeline that it is would explain the regimentality of TOS. To look on the growth and maturity of a society in the timeline of TOS it would have had to have gone thru some growing pains. DISCO is realistic in the fact that we didnt get to be open minded and organized as TOS with out some struggle. I hope that DISCO gets to continue to grow into the adult that becomes TOS and not have the producers get sidelined by all of this negativity spewed at it.",24 March 2019
"Well, evidently the only white heterosexual males in the future are all villains, with the exception of Chris Pike and Ash Tyler. Although even Ash is a Klingon trapped inside a human body... so there you go. But aside from that exclusion of a large part if the population, the story was OK... until season 3 which is starting to get to be... all over the place. Season 4 is even more of a disaster.

The latest season (4) is filled with a lot of confusing imagery and whiny characters. The storyline is awful. This is the worst ST series to date. By far.

Won't even bother with season 5. Thankfully that will be the last season.",19 May 2022
"I agree with fresh_prince668's opinion of November 5 that Star Trek is Utopia.

If you look at the original Enterprise from the top down, you'll see it looks like a Herschel H symbol of Uranus (which is another name for sky or Heaven.) The name Kirk is a Scottish word for church and nurse Christine Chapel just adds to it.

Please see: wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_symbols for how close the older symbol resembles the Enterprise from the top down.

I haven't watch any of the new shows, but from the reviews I have read, I wish the creative team would keep the idealization of the future as well as Lincoln's speech at Syracuse, New York in mind. To quote Lincoln: ""I wish you long life and prosperity individually, and pray that with the perpetuity of those institutions under which we have all so long lived and prospered, our happiness may be secured, our future made brilliant and the glorious destiny of our country established forever.""",6 November 2017

"Long time Star Trek fan, love the visuals.

That's pretty much it.

The story lines have gone downhill, the characters are hard to care about, verging very much on boredom watching this and finding myself skipping through the episodes rather than actually watching them with more than a minimum of attention.

Something needs to change.",28 November 2021
"Finally they've created a movie quality series and continuous story line that actually moves towards a conclusion. All the while staying true to the ideals that made Stark Trek appealing to millions of fans. The actors, set designs and graphics are excellent. This hands down the best Star Trek series to date. I hope CBS continues the series!",18 December 2020

"Smart, professional people doing smart things that are interesting while dealing with personal interactions and problems. That's the shortest summary of what in general Star Trek is about. STD is just the latter at best.

Season one was a rocky, bombastic and stupid. Probably the best episodes were the ones in the mirror universe. Everything else is a casualty of Trek rights being canibalized over the years and chase for money. Alex Kurtzman is an idiot that couldn't write his way out of a wet paper bag let alone do right about Star Trek franchise.

Plots don't make sense, characters are bland and not interesting, action is classic bayhem, explosions with little or no effect on anything. It's just dumb. Even The Last Ship was kinda better show than this.

Last straw for me was so petty and stupid, yet soooo this show, that made me give up on watching this. And no, it wasn't the episodes in season one where in one episode they basically retconned the episode before that one like it didn't happen (all that stuff about the planet and the crystal and whatever). No, it was in the first episode of season two when they brought out a damn fancy spinning camera on ship's hull that had a god damn flash while it was snapping photos in space. IT WAS A BIG CAMERA THAT SHOT FAR AWAY SPACE PHOTOS WITH A FLASH, IN SPACE! And then moments later - they did a ""enhance"" trope but with even more dumber twist - Saru had better eyes, so he saw details on a photo better..... COME ON.

CBS can go burn in failing subscription hell along with Alex Kurtzman.",19 January 2019
"At first, I really like Star Trek: Discovery and I wish we will see a lot of seasons in the future. But to be honest, I think the second season is drowning in emotional scenes. And sometimes I catch myself, I want to skip this scene, because I'm like ""ok, I've understand why this is emotional.. I've really understand... ok, can we go further?... Hello?"" :D For me, the mixture was way better in the first season. And sometimes, the dialogues felt a bit wrong for some characters - it doesn't fit. Hopefully it shift a bit back to the character of the first season.",9 February 2019
I tried and tried and it gets worse every minute. Im tired of wokeness with movies and shows. Nobody wanted to see SA on the show as we barely stomach her on the news. When hollyweird gets back to making movies rather than woke-ovies ill watch something else. Terribel show. All over the place.,18 March 2022
"To be honest, nothing will please the small number of fanatical trekkies out there... Hence all the low scores (probably made by a hand full of guys with multiple accounts). If your into sci-fi series in general then check both this and the orville out. Both fantastic in thier own ways.",14 March 2019
"Star Trek Discovery is one of the worst Star Trek series or TV shows ever made. It should not have the honorary title of Star Trek next to it. It is not Star Trek. I am all for equality and giving representation to LGBTQ community which I feel star trek has greatly underrepresented in the past. However, Star Trek was always about hope for the future and what mankind can aspire too. Which in the past star trek series racism and internal strife was nonexistent. A world or ideal which I would love to live in, like Star Trek TNG. Star Trek Discovery is not a world I would like to live in. Discovery has internal conflict and a pessimistic ideal of human beings and other species. It is absolutely, not about science or math which some charters have stupidly stated ""I love science or math is cool"" Like the audience is a bunch of dumb 6 graders. It has become Star Wars. Shoot first and ask questions later, explosions, and action scenes. Star Trek Discovery is another version of Star Wars, which is a scifi fantasy. At least in TNG they had technical advisors that would provide scientific theories or ideas of technologies which could happen in the future. Which made the idea of Star Trek TNG a possible future we could live in.

Past Star Trek series had a cerebral type of storytelling. Stories that made people think and ask questions and discuss with friends or even taught in college level classes. Discovery has none of that. I can go back to TNG and enjoy the episodes as I once did when I first saw them as a teenager. Discovery has none of the nostalgia Star Trek has. It has non memorable characters or stories.

I believe this series will be forgotten and not remember fondly. The only reason I believe it continues is because some Star Trek fans wanted Star Trek back after a long hiatus. They dont care about the story or the ideals. I will admit I was so excited about Star Trek coming back. However, the Discovery has destroyed the vision of Star Trek and what it represents as it has been quoted in previous Star Trek show of why we don't use money in the future.

"If you had to make a paradigm of every poor TV show on air today, this would be it. Plots with holes so big you could fly a starship through them. Ridiculous tropes that are so far removed from reality that it's impossible to believe them. Characters that are written so superficially that their unprofessional behaviour is waved away as adult emotion. Adults who emote like 3 year old children. Battles for the sake of filling the screen with lasers. No internal consistency within the universe. The list goes on...

After watching every Trek show, I can no longer watch this. Just absolutely terrible.",30 November 2020
I wanted to like this so much. Watched a couple seasons. And the liberal agenda shoving was just getting worse and worse. It kind of has the same issue deep space 9 had where there is a super awasome story line that you are really interested in but instead we have to stop for 20 min and talk about people's emotional issues and feelings. This show had so much potential but the agendas ruined it.,28 March 2022
"My rating system is 5 is mediocre, I'll watch a 5 to pass the time but won't make any special effort. I clicked on 5 and quite easily moved this down to a 2.

I've read a couple of reviews on here and I concur with a lot of it but some of more technical side is irrelevant to me personally because though I was a HUGE TNG fan, I never passed this devotion onto DS9, Voyager or Enterprise. I was quite prepared to come into a new ST series without the baggage of these series, fairly low expectations and looked to get hooked on something fresh in the sci fi genre. Surely a target audience member to CBS and Netflix?

Sadly they missed the mark.

Stand alone or within the ST universe, these first two episodes were really uninspiring. The characters, plot, script, and cinematography were so mundane. The creators really missed a trick here and I feel they were on the wrong track from Day 1 by looking backwards in the timeline, not forwards.

I am sure they were trying to grab fresh new young devotees to the universe but on any sci-fi level, this was weak.

I obtained the first 2 episodes through my UK netflix subscription, even at no additional cost, I wonder if I'll continue. Maybe I will to support Mr Isaacs (Hello to Jason Isaacs). I hear the US are asking for a additional fee to watch this series and I am sorry, I can't see many taking this up! I sense a very early canning of this series.

Save your $9, go buy Firefly on a cheap DVD and watch that instead!",28 September 2017
This season is painful to watch. It's just endless minutes of emotional dialogue and irrelevant feel good talk. I miss the science in science fiction.,27 November 2021
"I hate myself for writing such a poor review but this ST iteration just doesn't know how to raise itself from its own doldrums. Just watched Discovery S2 Ep13 and I thought I was watching The Bold and the Beautiful. But that show is true to its soap opera genre. Discovery has no idea what genre it wants to be. I just can't believe the amount of crying on this show, and not just in this episode, from Star Fleet officers who are supposed to be saving the Federation and the Galaxy. Every scene is a soundbite of a few seconds, the thing proceeds at a dizzying pace and feels like a video game not a TV series. I started by loving it in S1 and by now the disappointment is so great I watch it out of sheer morbid curiosity. -Martin-Green has settled into a one facial expression fits all: head tilted to one side and flat delivery accompanied by misty eyes. As for her relationship to Amanda and Sarek, it's totally unconvincing, despite those two solidly played characters, Frain being incredibly impressive -the most interesting characters are underutilised or killed: Stamets and Culver, Reno, Airiam, Saru, Leland -a hairy Spock iteration to make you tear your hair out, despite Peck's excellent acting -a Tilly who's developed into merely annoying -Klingons used as a convenient dramatic device, not in their own right, despite them being by far the best actors of the lot, especially the stellar Mary Chieffo as L'Rell. -Latif playing Voq-Ash opposite her is laughable, he's such an incredibly weak character. -Yeoh started well but has descended into travesty, coming across as a third rate dominatrix -Only Anson Mount is spectacularly impeccable and pitch perfect as Pike. But one character cannot save the mess that surrounds him. No wonder he escapes to the Enterprise, helmed by an exquisite Rebecca Romijn as No 1. Why don't they do a series on that early part of the Enterprise before Pike's accident. Plenty of scope there.

Sorry, Discovery. I wanted to love you but your writers wouldn't let me.",12 April 2019
"S1 and S2 were brilliant, slowly through S3 a woke current started running through the characters and stories... S4, just can't carry on, not even sure what this show is anymore... lost it's edge, fun, adventure... just focused on pouting, whispering, not offending, woke... hoping Strange New Worlds may bring back the fun and adventure instead.",25 December 2021
"This atrocity is not Star trek. Star Trek was not just sc-fi but a tribute to the genius of human kind, the anti war, anti fake religion, anti racism. Star Trek showed values, true believable characters, great special effects, the goals of humans to explore space and go boldly where no one had.

This new show simply does not cut it, it shows unbelievable violence, bigotry, racism and the worse of humans. The special effects are bad. The stories of each show seem like they were written by angry selfish children. The acting is about the worse I've ever seen. How can this call this Star trek is beyond me

What a way to kill a 52 year old good franchise.

I surely hope they remove this awful show and tell it's writers to go elsewhere.",29 April 2018
"First 3 seasons were pretty good - especially the Captain Pike season, but since then each episode attempts to out Woke the last episode. Burnham looks at all times like she is about to cry.

"Being a huge fan of Star Trek, I know Gene Roddenberry is turning in his grave. I'm not sure what this is, but this is not star trek. This is an oligarchy propaganda TV show filled with oligarchy subliminal agendas This is about war & killing. Star Trek was never about that. It's way off the motto of the show.

The final frontier, these are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise Its 5 year mission, to explore strange new worlds, To seek out new life and new civilizations. To boldly go where no man has gone before",28 September 2017
"Dear Oh dear,

I watched the first two episodes because, despite the bad reviews, I thought fans were just being a bit hysterical so I decided to form my own opinion. Well, this is just terrible.

Who the hell thought that Michelle Yeoh , an aging Chinese actress who speaks in a thick Chinese accent, could carry the role of Captain? She is so mis-cast it is horrible,and personally I think her acting skills are terrible, and she looks over Botoxed as well. Sonequa, the black woman as No 1, is pretty enough to look at, but has not the acting skills, charisma or power to carry this role at all. Another horrible mis-casting decision. And what the hell is that science officer supposed to be? You can't relate to a character that looks like the face was chiseled out of a wood working shed. Half the show was Klingon monsters wearing silly wooden masks and speaking Klingon, so that will put you to sleep pretty fast. In the first 2 episodes, there is not a single cast member that can act or is interesting enough to relate to in the show. From ep3, the new captain is a good actor, but his role is minor compared to the female cast that dominate the whole show. And finally, the script was just so damn boring, I really couldn't care less about what was happening. I finished off just shaking my head and feeling sad that the Star Trek legacy has been so tarnished by the execs at CBS , who are clearly more concerned about making a politically correct statement about women and minorities than about making a good sci fi show. Massive Fail guys ! Just goes to show what happens when execs with lots of money but no love for good sci fi create a show. Hollywood's feminist power social agenda is really getting pretty sick these days. Enough already!For the record, I love good strong female characters in my sci fi: Linda Hamilton in Terminator, Sigourney Weaver in Alien, Melissa Oneill in Dark Matter are all lead characters and have the power and brilliance to make it work. Sadly STD is not on this list.",27 September 2017
"I thought maybe just maybe they had a better story line going but no, enter some stupid green horrible looking makeup job hulk alien woman just to make it junk once again. I REALLY HOPE one day that they fire all the writers, producers, etc. and actually make a REAL actual Star Trek that ""DISCOVERS"" strange alien worlds instead of the same old crap over and over again. I will continue to hold my reviews at 1 star until they do and I noticed A LOT of people agree with me on this. Just cancel this one and let someone who knows wtf they're doing come in.",25 December 2020
"First off, I want to clarify that this review is not based on the so-called ""grandpa mentality"". I am actually into revisions if the history is more accurate or the fiction stories better. Nor is this due to any issues with LGBT. I am bisexual. I am also quite happy to see more gender and racial / ethnic diversity. My issues with the show are the following.

Subscription requirement - I am not interested in adding more subscriptions. The networks and studios are late to the subscription party. I personally think that they should collaborate with the existing services. I have already paid for shows which ultimately went in bad story directions. Battlestar Gallactica is an example. I wasted too much money on the show for it to resolve with god having done it. On the free side, we have Enterprise which had far too much time travel and Deep Space 9 which washed out with the change of the wormhole aliens, which changed much of the content. So Star Trek has a spotty record for it to be only on a pay service.

Fantasy sci-fi - I was hoping that Star Trek would lean more away from the excessively fantastical. I mean, why have such an extreme fantasy as a spore drive? Then there's the instant communications over vast distances and other examples already covered in other comments. And time travel is so overdone. Inconsistent storylines in the franchise - The story quality is not sufficient to accept the differences from the rest of the Star Trek timeline. This is a hazard with moving backward in the storyline. The story has to be sufficiently good to warrant the differences. In my opinion, Enterprise failed at this as did the recent movies. I'm tired of Klingons. I am also tired of the portrayals of violence. And this Star Trek is the most violent of the Star Trek TV series.

Violence - Right out of the box and throughout the series so far, this is a darker and more violent series. I was excited to hear that the series was going to include gay characters and more female leads. But these gains are nullified by the backward actions of too many characters.

Too much concentration on the past without maintaining consistency with the existing story - It is true that Star Trek had flaws but the overall story was solid. Yet, as with too many reboots and reimagined TV and movies, the powers that be can't seem to consistently continue the story. I would be OK with starting fresh if the story was better. But too much of this new story is regenerating flawed sci-fi elements and creating new ones. Although imperfect, The Next Generation had the better idea of moving the story forward rather than backward. I was hoping that would be the case with the new series. That would have allowed for new directions without messing with the overall story up to that point. Star Trek has a universe of possibilities but the powers seem intent on writing them into such a corner where they have to break things.",20 February 2018
"This is very painful to watch and so boring.. Who is writing this garbage? I cant even remember more than 3 characters. I guess this isnt for true Star Trek fans.

All four seasons were garbage.",16 May 2022
"I have been a Star Trek fan for years and was looking forward to this new series. It started off boring and then just went to bad. The boring part reminded me of the first Star Trek movie with the endless views of the Enterprise. Then we had a rip-off of ""Gravity"". Then bad part was no character development, poor acting and thin plot. If you have not already watched this episode, save an hour of your life and skip it.

I did not initially know that this series was going to be available on streaming only for a fee with CBS all access. CBS made a big mistake by putting out a free episode. Few people who saw it will fork out the money for their service to see this series.",24 September 2017
I am so sorry I wasted a christmas getting excited about new star trek shows. Its horrendous and made by people who only care that the checks clear. They clearly consider just GETTING the job to be success. The episodes are bad and every one is an emotional wreck which makes no sense.,19 April 2022
"I have been able to watch all but 2 episodes in 3 seasons of this abysmal show, hoping it would get better. It did not. In fact, it got worse. Discovery is one of the worst Sci Fi shows I have forced myself to watch. The acting is absolutely terrible, the stories are preachy and uninteresting, unless you are a ""woke"" person. I watch TV to be ENTERTAINED not to watch Millenials and below get a hoot out of their juvenile politics. That I made it to all but 2 shows? Is because I believe before you review a show, you should at least WATCH it. The haters on the Picard thread watch ONE episode and give it a 1 rating. Picard is so far ahead of Discovery in just one season, those who hated it, I am now convinced they have NO IDEA what Gene Roddenberry and ST-TNG, DS9, and Voyager were as futuristic shows with hope in humanity and fabulous acting, stories, cinematography and a future where humanity betters itself. I knew if I watched one more Discovery episode, I would be tempted to put an eye out. I honestly no longer have any hope left for humanity. The selfishness, and bad behavior being looked at askance by the liberals? Will be our downfall. Which Discovery highlights and Picard does not, in any way. You all will downrate this because IMDb is mostly aimed at the arts and entertainment community who have been brainwashed and can no longer think independently. Trouble is, you ruin it for the average human who lives for their families, their work, and their average, everyday lives. Take Discovery off the Paramount line up, PLEASE? It really is very, very bad TV!",1 August 2021

"I didn't expect CBS to come to my house, ring my doorbell, walk in and tell me to go FLICK myself, but that's what they did. Weird. I'm an old-school fan of Star Trek but they're telling me that they want to do a different show, call it ""Star Trek"" but make it appeal to a completely different audience.

I guess they can. I can't change that.

But when you take something beautiful, destroy it's identity and put it out on the street to make some quick cash you're a pimp. Welcome to pimp-hood, CBS.",25 September 2017
"Every episode is worse than the other. Gaudy, sparkly blinking lights and beep beeps, inexplicably asymmetrical uniforms and moronic whiny speeches. The lgbtq+ deserves more than out of places characters applied to the story like stickers.",13 January 2022
"Watch this and compare it to DS9, Voyager, and TNG to get a sense of its quality. And the quality is subpar. Not in the special effects department, obviously, but in the department of writing intelligent plots, character development, delighting the audience, and improving our understanding of space, the final frontier.

The signature of Star Trek series is intelligent plots that make us think, curious, and humble (and feel good about life, so we can come back and watch more). Season 1 and 2 Discovery had some of these here and there, and I kept expecting further improvement and delight, but it kept getting sabotaged by disproportional focus on supbar acting performances with inane storylines.

Which brings me to the second point: interwoven with intelligent plots are the interesting and compelling (and yes sometimes clumsy) characters of Trek, albeit not always consistent in exciting us, yet they would still draw us to the TV: Picard's impeccable command of English language and leadership skills; Data's childlike curiosity; Sisko's persuasion and character reading skills; Chakotay's rebellious streak yet ""voice-of-reason"" bravado; Seven's unique perspectives on what it means to be a human as a result of her experiences as a Borg.

There are many others that you remember and they may put a smile on your face, evoking good memories. You can say ""they mattered. Yes at times they were silly, but good silly. They uplifted my spirits. I learned something from them that stayed with me.""

Why does Michael Burnham matter? (and why does Discovery and her crew matter for that matter?) I still cannot answer these questions after 3 seasons.

Also knowing that the writing is severely shackled/compromised against the backdrop of the trendy woke agenda, Discovery offers a diminished, downgrading Star Trek experience. It's ironic, isn't it? Because Trek is supposed to represent the freedom of space, the final frontier.

Watching the 5th episode of the 3rd season, I stopped streaming it finally because my eyes started rolling so badly and involuntarily they began to hurt my face. Listen to your body for signs of stress; it doesn't lie.

I will leave it at that for the rest to ponder about.",29 March 2021
"Show was alright at first, some leaps of logic were made but sure. Season 4 turned this around by completely leaving the star trek universe and ideas behind and diving fully into the idea of having a star trek captain cry in every episode.

Too many emotional moments when action is needed. I hope the directors fix this and get back to Star Trek rather than an interstellar therapy session. Hey Michael, did you have enough ""whine"" with that speech?",17 January 2021
"Consistently defies the Star Trek story line, however it's written as a prequel so the show stand to destroy everything in previously created Star Trek shows that made it so good. Not to mention the political agenda they are pushing. I've watched it all & every bit of it sucks, the mycelium is cool, but that's awesome even in real life. From egotistically Star Fleet personnel, to technology that's better than better than it should be because its a prequel, all the way to the strange broke back mountain scenes they push on the audience(Being gay is okay btw but when they make the scene solely about that, it's awkward). How does Star Trek from the 80's graphics look better btw? Maybe they should move away from the heavy CGI use, & I say this as a 3D artist, it has it's time & place. Literally can't wait for CBS to sell or get rid of the rights so someone much better can retain it's title. The basic feel of Star Trek isn't even there, generally it would have been a amazing storyline, but this one tosses the story line in the space ejection system & worries about politically correct marketing. Tbh the first thing I would do is fire the entire marketing department.",22 October 2021

"When you eliminate all the 10 ratings from paid hacks and 1 ratings from the trolls what you will find is a passable sci-fi series. Not good by any stretch of the imagination, but not horrible either.

Fans of previous series and indeed the franchise in general have a tendency to truly despise this rewrite of ST cannon. Those looking for a great general Sci-Fi show(outside the ST universe) probably won't hate it.

Good, such as it is:

Acting is decent.

CGI is decent.

Pace is good for me.

The not so good:

If they were going to use the name, they should have hired writers with more than a passing familiarity with the franchise.

Throughout the years ST(TOS,TNG,DS9, et al) have subtly dealt with societal issues in conjunction with entertaining story lines. STD(and did they really consider how this would be abbreviated) seems to have decided to try and tie in some stories(poorly) with their societal statements.

Overall:

Probably would have given in a 6, but CBS wants me to pay for the privilege of watching this one and it just ain't worth it.

Watchable, but far from great. My suggestion is to wait til it hits a free service after they cancel it, but hey...its your cash.",2 December 2017
"The creators of this atrocity should be ashamed to call this Star Trek. None of the Star Trek canon is there. The characters are hollow. The acting is bad. The special effects are discusting. No fun, no adventure. no character. Also the jumping is stupid as even in thousand years it could not actually exist. I am sure that Roddenberry must be turning in his tomb! I only give this 1 out of 10. Maybe the creators of this show should change pushers",24 February 2018
"I'll admit that the Star Trek timeline could due with some tweaks. But radical departures are unnecessary. And STD is a radical departure from the Start Trek timeline. If the story line is going to be altered, make sure that the story is well done. This is not good sci- fi. Some of the technologies require a major suspension of mental faculties to accept. And the characters act in unrealistic, unappealing and unintelligent ways.

I thought that Enterprise was damaging to TV Star Trek. But, unless STD is abandoned and people pretend that it never existed, Star Trek TV is seriously damaged. One positive think is that this show motivated to me get back into the Star Trek novels as a means to forget what I watched.",31 October 2017

"Enjoy Star Trek. Was a teenager when the original aired. Have viewed all the series and all the movies.

Enjoyed the special effects, costumes, species, and technology. Very cool and contemporary. Unfortunately the plot was thin and the characters cardboardish. The lines were delivered like fortune cookies and the idea that a starship should have a squabbling senior crew overdone. While it was interesting to attempt a backstory concerning Klingons and the Federation in the first episode, it sorta felt cartoonish.

Unfortunately I will not see the remainder of the series, at least as it stands now, as I will not pay for the CBS stream. From what I can tell, I may not miss out all that much. At this point in time there's so much prior material that fills in this universe, so I cannot support this episode's sophomoric writing. The tech and special effects can hold attention only for a time.",24 September 2017

"Not only is this bad Trek, it's just plain bad TV. Not just bad, but horrible. Unbearable. Some of the worst anything that's ever been done at any point.

There is absolutely 0 talent involved with anything outside of the effects team. Horrendous acting from EVERYONE. Martin Green is one of the worst actresses I've ever witnessed attempt to convey an emotion. Bad. Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad. Just BAD! And she's not even the worst!

The writing is void of any intelligence, sensible progression, or even effort it seems. Everything about the writing and acting is juvenile, illogical, and horrendous.

And can they hire a camera operator that can HOLD THE DAMN CAMERA STILL? This is shaky camera x10, and it actually makes me nauseous to watch (although I'm sure the acting and writing don't help)

AND why do they have next-episode previews AND episode recaps on a streaming service?!?!??!?!?!?!??!?!?!??!?!?! ?!?!??g1237ha8whrfiunawefbuia8renf!?!?!?!?!?!??! How GD dumb is CBS?

So we have a gay couple, and the series seems to want to beat us over the head with that over and over, instead of it just being a normal thing. Just make it the same as the other couples, it's not a big of a deal!

Episodic Trek proves better. Having a series devoted to a singular idea falls flat.

Yes deep space nine had themes that continued but it was well though out. This is all over the place.

It was tolerable while Captain Pike was a part of the series, it has now evolved into a colossal waste of time.

As far as this series goes: It's really bad. The dialog is boring and yet hard to follow. The special effects are fake looking and over done. The Klingons are cartoonish and plasticky. The ship keeps changing angles, I guess because the director had a crick in his neck? The second episode was worse. To top it all off, it's like a SJW vomited on my TV.

The special effect either look like ""Tron"" (the 1982 version) or ""Dark Crystal"". And everyone to a person appears to have lost the ability to act. It's a saccharine, boring, hippy love-fest.

Of course I couldn't watch the full first episode because as always football bumped the show.

"Well, the pilot was very disappointing. The story, if there is any, seemed very rushed and badly put together. The characters are not very likable and you simply can't related to them. First and second officer trying to impress the captain. A fearful second officer, a smartypants (or better to say arrogant) first officer and what's the deeper sense of giving a male forename to a female first officer? There are so many other things I could list here, for what is wrong with this new Star Trek series, but let me sum it up by saying, ""It doesn't feel like the Star Trek universe we know and love."".

The acting seemed a bit wooden, but I am not sure if the actors should be blamed for that or the bad script or the bad directing. At the end of the day, an actor can only work what he or she has. And even a good actor can't make a bad script with bad dialogues good.

Ultimately every answer to every question comes from her, every scene is about her in one way or another, every reason every character does or says anything is because of her. The Captain consults everyone but only Michael has the solution. Her roommate has all kinds of questions but only Michael has the answers. In fact, the fate of the entire galaxy, of all the timelines, of every reality rests wholly and solely on her shoulders - but thankfully, despite making mistakes along the way, Michael also happens to be the only one everyone can rely on. The rest of the crew is there to give the writers an excuse to circle everything back to Michael. This is modern day Star Trek writing at its absolute laziest.",2 February 2019

The story was uninspired, as if all that was important was to showcase characters that were not male and white. Too much useless fighting.

The first episode has some pansy-ass, snowflake crying during the Klingon attack. ""Why are we fighting? We're explorers"" boo hoo hoo. Thankfully he dies seconds after. Fraternization between crew members runs rampant, with loads of inappropriate relationships that would destroy any normal ships morale. In episode 9, Ash gets sent to a Klingon ship to assist Michael; he breaks down on the ship and goes into a PTSD coma. Was he not thoroughly examined after his liberation? After being held captive for 7 years, he's good to go to return to the ship he was imprisoned on? Stuuuupid. Admiral Cornwell in conversation with L'Rell, when questioned about Klingon captives held by Star Fleet responds: ""They are imprisoned"". ""They are interrogated...humanely."" Seriously? They are politely waterboarded????? No wonder the Klingons want to destroy them. Stuuuupid. This series makes such an effort to be so all-inclusive, politically correct, unoffensive and wishy-washy, that ends up being a lame and plastic storyline with cardboard characters. CPT. Lorca is the only slightly redeemable character but is diminished by the fact that he's nailing Admiral Cornwell, who is supposed to be his boss.

Star Trek is supposed to be about an evolved civilisation that's moved on from where we are today. It offered hope and humour, whilst still being an exciting space adventure story for the whole family. This is not that type of Star Trek. This is a visually stunning negative of the old type of show. It's dark, definitely not child friendly and humourless.

However I'm conflicted though in what I think of it. On the whole I like the show, after all I'm a sucker for great visual effects and the acting is great, but I long for the humour and moral high ground that the show should stand for.

There was a review by the Socialist World Movement attached to the first episode of season two. I figured they'd call it the greatest thing ever since so many on the left were loving this one. To my utter surprise and shock they agreed with me. An Anarchist. I was amazed. They had every criticism I had. When the Anarchist and the Socialist can agree that this Star Trek has nothing to do with the original series or basic scriptwriting logic for that matter. I suggest reading the review. It is quite enlightening.,27 January 2018
"Recently it was revealed that Star Fleet replicators take human waste (ie. excrement) and breaks it down to reconstitute it into good food.

Discovery is does the reverse. It takes good ideas, talented actors, good production design, etc, and breaks it all down and spews out crap instead.

I just watched Black Sails, The Boys, The Mandalorian and am currently in Season 5 of The Expanse, but finally I got back to Discovery after the uneven Seasons 1 and 2. But compared to those other series, this is just so embarassingly amateur in comparison. Season 3 is appalling bad. How could they have taken such a bad turn?

I know all of those involved in this have done better work elsewhere, so the blame lies with the writers and the producers. But boy, do they deserve it.

I could go on, but enough said. Star Trek as a franchise is in a bad place. Sporadic quality and stale ideas and flatout bad writing is not going to maintain viewers, let alone create new ones, in the face of such good alternatives.

Such a shame.",5 January 2021
"Firstly, there is not nearly enough space on this forum for me to explain why this is NOT a Star Trek show, so I'll summarise those points. 1) There is zero character development. 2) The audience is not invested in what happens to crew members. 3) The enlightened world of the 24th century is replaced by a cast of current themes, stories and predictable plot twists of today's teen dramas. 4) The script, dialogue and interactions are lazy, boring and akin to Buffy The Vampire Slayer.

But the worst thing about this show is that there is only one character this show focuses on, and that's Michael Burnham. Every scene, every issue, every impact, every single thing that happens to everyone, that involves anyone, that the crew do, that the mission entails, centres entirely around Burnham. She has the answer to all the problems. She saves everyone because only she knows it all. Every scene involves her, and the odd scene that does not include her in it includes her in the character interactions. I've never ever watched a Star Trek show that is solely about one person and one person only - everyone else is incidental. Cannon fodder. Insignificant. She is a scientist, so she knows more than the head scientist. She has cures that even the doctors never consider. She is a better tactician than the Captain, the Commander, the First Officer and even a panel of Admirals. But, of course, we're not allowed to criticise her because if we do we're racist, or sexist, or both.

I gave this a 4 because the visuals are pleasing (though it's not Star Trek and certainly not a show set before TOS). The other characters (I only know if two of them by name, the others are passers by according to the writers) are interesting but largely undervalued. And the addition of Captain Christopher Pike is welcome, but it's annoying that he constantly defers to her judgement over his own (again, saying this will make me sound sexist, of course, despite the fact that Pike is captain and Burnham is an officer).

Lazy writing. Predictable acting. Long, long and long boring conversations about how she feels. And repetitive. (In one episode, Burnham discusses her feelings about her family with the Captain on 4 different occasions using almost the exact same words, each time asking her captain to 'trust her' - which of course he does because, well, it's the Michael Burnham show.",21 February 2019

"I have watched 7 episodes and each of them are terrible. The TV industry do not make programmes any more. They have forgotten that television is ""moving pictures"". Instead they carried on with JJ assbrams ridiculous destruction of Star Trek and Star Wars, by using lens flare (number pet hate), bright lightnings and jerky motions. All attempts at clever CGI failed. If i want my eyes to irritated, i would go to a nightclub, but not at home.

Their obsession with diversity and political correctness means the casts are terrible and don't gel. Not one actor had any redeeming quality. They all looked like they didn't want to be associated with Star Trek.

The whole new technologies is out of kilter with Star Trek timeline, spore drive - really, oh come on, this is so blooming lame and stupid. The script is lame and the casts bicker all the time, argumentative, women are showed to be incapable of following orders, understanding the chain of command.

"I'm a long term Star Trek fan, I watched STTNG as it aired the new episode every week in the 80s, which made me want to go back and watch TOS and subsequently DS9 and Voyager. This series has none of the magic of those series, and I would say it's the worst Trek ever, however CBS saved their worst for ST Picard. The story telling is poor, and the cast are annoying, badly written and instantly forgettable. Its also ridiculously political attempting to comment or show examples of gender, race or sexuality in a way that 2020 audiences will appreciate...... well we don't. I'd prefer it if you stop making this crap, erase it, and give it to some writers that are capable of writing good science fiction, as opposed to writers that pat themselves on the back for force feeding this drivel down our throats.",23 October 2020

"I'm halfway through season three now, although I did fast forward terra firma part one and two, and there is a thing that constantly bothers me. Here is a crew that is set to hundred years in the future, they've gone through Starfleet Academy and they are now on a starship yet they use 20th century slang and colloquialisms. I've been alive for 50 years, and the slang and colloquialisms I was using 20 and 30 years ago are mostly no longer in use, so why would 20th century slang be still around in the 23rd century? My Dad was the greatest generation, he fought in World War II, and every now and then he would use slang from that era and I had to ask him what it even meant. You wouldn't believe what they used to call a cigarette. this goes to show that this shows writers are either lazy, lame or just plain ignorant. That's what was great about the other Star Trek shows, very good writers, they went to a lot of trouble to not use current slang and colloquialisms in a future set show.",7 January 2021
"I tried so hard to like Discovery, to give it a chance. But the further along the series you go, the worse it gets. I made it up to the last episode of season three before I just couldn't take it any more. If you've watched it too, you probably know why.

The series completely revolves around Michael Burnham, who is arguably the least likeable character from any tv series ever. What's really sad is that the rest of the cast are much better characters but barely get any screen time because it's all used up with close-up shots of Michael being sad, or Michael being happy, or Michael being in love. It's a soap opera in a sci-fi setting. It isn't Star Trek.",16 January 2021
"As with many trek fans I felt we were overdue for a new series. I actually liked much of Enterprise. I thought maybe they would have learned from the good bits of Enterprise and DS9. (There were no good bits in Voyager). I hoped we would get individual episodes with a background arc of something bigger. Instead we get a complete abandonment of everything Trek ever stood for. War as a first resort, violence, gory special effects, Star Wars aliens everywhere, exposition of everything, it is just garbage from the start.

If you love Star Trek just go and watch the Orville and ignore that the uniforms and badges are slightly wrong (although often less wrong than in Discovery!).",8 January 2018
"I was all for the casting of a female minority as the lead in a new Star Trek series, actually it's a refreshing change. But when I found out it was Sonequa Martin-Green as that lead my expectations dropped to the floor. As a fan of TWD, she was undoubtedly the worst actor on the show. Her acting always felt contrived, wooden, and just bad. Nevertheless I wanted to give the series a chance because I'm a big Star Trek fan.

After giving the show a chance, I'm disappointed to say my low expectations (about the lead) were correct. The poor acting skills of Sonequa Martin-Green take away from an otherwise good production.

You can make a debate about whether or not this series is true to Star Trek, but you can't make a debate about whether or not Sonequa Martin- Green is a good actor. It's like night and day.",1 November 2017
"When you gave up hope the end is near... After NG and DS9 Paramount took just wrong choices, Voyager, for example or catastrophic Enterprise and when you thought it can't be worse that that, surprise! It's Discovery, with stupid and illogical lines, even for a philosopher. Watch just the first 10 minutes of the first episode and you'll get what I mean. What happened to screenplay people in the last decade. Just bad movies and grand franchises made smashes. After Ridley Scott dementia (bearing a gold franchise for good), they are keep coming...Star Wars, Oscar movies etc. I lost hope, I really did. I think i will have a rerun of my old good NG and DS9 volumes in my home theater. Oh, almost forgot, don't spend a dime for this movie, it's worse than you imagined.",2 December 2017
"God this is a strange series of Star Trek. It rather reminds me of what Stargate Universe was to SG1. Maybe, just maybe someone somewhere however unwittingly is allowing the powers that be the reason to kill the franchise off.

The history of Star Trek is so great so why muck it up with a lets everybody in the universe be a carbon copy of a mostly warped (get it?) version of people now inhabiting our real world.

Severn of Nine, Tom Paris were the sort of ""warped"" characters I loved to watch in Voyager.

Just sometimes you want to escape from the real world not be faced with a whole ship stuffed with awkward difficult sometimes brittle minority personalities. Do I have to admit that maybe these are in the majority now.

So no uplifting humour as in Voyager where if you feel you really just want to have a laugh you can cull various episodes to watch and for me its Picardo as the Doctor.

I suppose it was worth looking at an ""evil "" version of the Klingons as per the original first series, which I remember as a very young kid. Yet I had kind of got used to the helpful to the cause Klingons in the more recent series. The Borg were much more evil in the context they were introduced in the 1980s and gave any Klingon a serious run for its money let alone the humans which in that decade also had Terminators to give the human race especially those with and I quote ""i've got a problem to deal with first"" a tough time. These are the sort of people that might inhabit Discovery.

On the credit side it is modern CGI and full of mostly dark sinister scenes which is de rigueur now.

So the mapped out, so far, characters don't seem to have anything in common with Star Treks of years past. The Michael (crap name for a woman by the way) Burnham has ""indeed"" nothing in common with any Vulcan I have watched previously. Lorca, as one commentator phrased it, is a simply a ""shady"" character so nothing in common with previous captains but maybe something in common with, although not a captain, Dr Rush in Universe. So harsh and depressing.

On this note I would end with pointing out there has not been another TV Stargate since.",22 November 2017

"Ok, so I read many reviews ripping this this series apart in every aspect. I have to say I don't mind the story been told so far in these 3 seasons. It is interesting enought to keep me engaged to see what happens next. The best part of this show are the visuals which I enjoy alot, especially since season 3. Is it necessary to have the story being told and so heavily centered around one character? No! It would not automatically ruin it for me. The major problem is, and here is agree with most of the reviewers, that the character of M. Burnham is annoying. Either that is how the part is written or Martin-Green is extremely overacting. It is truly frustrating to see the center character constantly having an emotional breakdown on a ST series. Your normal Joe working 9 to 5 cannot afford to be such an emotional wreck. How should we accept as viewers someone working on a science vessel in the future could be this unstable? And yes, she really does whisper all the time. Who came up with this? Unfortunaly this Burnham character goes tremendously on my nerves more and more and I actually do think about stop watching.

So please showrunners, make some major adjustment to Burnham and other wheepy characters, such as Tilly. Give the crew in general more of a backbone and less emotional traumas on a weekly base. Georgiou and Saru are my favourites because they don't cry a river each episode. 3 stars for the visuals, 1 star for the story and 1 star of course for M. Yeoh.",2 December 2020
"One star is too much to qualify this abomination. It is the most pathetic, irritating, and badly scripted series ever conceived in television history. Plus, it has the most uninteresting or annoying characters I've ever seen. It's a complete aberration, an insult to intelligence.",15 July 2021
"I've seen every second of every ST show and film ever made. I recently watched the remastered original series and loved every second. The original series was low tech by comparison to the newer shows, but it filled us with wonder and amazement. The crew were explorers with good intentions and usually solved their problems with diplomacy and wondrous technology. Occasionally the Enterprise crew was forced into conflict and that was also entertaining but it was never the sole focus.

STD a complete departure from the culture, morality and spirit of Star Trek. It's simply not Star Trek. Its a formula Gen-Y sci-fi soap with the typical obligatory dash of liberalism thrown in. I don't think Hollywood is even capable of making a show without a progressive liberal agenda nowadays.

STD has many timeline issues as many others have mentioned. It doesn't feel at all like a prequel to the original series. Even Harcourt Fenton Mudd is all wrong. He just seems way too sinister and they somehow lost the jovial ""traveling salesman"" qualities of the original character.

I get it. They are trying to make a fresh modern and slightly dark version of ST that appeals to young folks. Even if that was a good idea (it isn't), they missed the mark. Instead they created a hot mess.

These people had an ENORMOUS opportunity to make a new Star Trek series. It could have easily been the best thing on TV in years! Instead they created a crap show. What a shame.",2 November 2017

The only reason this absolute farce of a show has been renewed is to keep shoving an agenda down your throat, if you want real Star Trek just go and re watch the older series because this will not only disappoint you but also leave you infuriated.

Seriously this show should not only be cancelled ASAP but it's creators and sponsors should be arrested for calling this Star Trek.",9 November 2020
"Firstly to explain what I mean. Star trek has always had it's acronyms for the various series. TOS - the original series. TNG - the next generation. DS9 - Deep space 9. And now STD - sexually transmitted disease.....sorry, Star trek Discovery!

Ah where to start. I grew up with Trek. My dad showed me the original series when I was a kid, which was very camp and fun. Then TNG started in my early teens, which I loved. DS9, voyager etc later, also liked. BUT, I'm not a trekker, trekkie, whatever! I don't know how many dilithium crystals it takes to power a star ship, I couldn't tell you how big the enterprise is in feet and I have no uniforms hanging in my closet. So I won't be reviewing this as a direct technical comparison to the originals or on it's chronological nerd flaws, and ""oooh that panel wouldn't look like that, that wasn't designed until star date..."" Oh shut up!

As a stand alone thing...well...it's not great! It's watchable, but there are some moments when it feels decidedly cheesy. And the plot holes are so big, families of Japanese tourists gather around them with their cameras! It's not just holes. It's needless scenes too... The latest episode featured a punch-up that came out of nowhere, seemingly for no other reason than the writer wanted to see a fight! there are a few moments like this, where you go ""why the hell did they do that?""

Dialogue is another issue. The lines are delivered so unbelievably at times, I feel like i'm watching a screen test, or warm up. the script isn't great either, which is probably the real issue. Often the characters will say things that people just wouldn't say in the given circumstances.

On the subject of characters. That is pretty thin on the ground too. Nobody is particularly likable. Micheal is about the only character to root for and even she isn't exactly the warmest glow on the set. She's also very illogical for somebody supposedly trained in the ways of logic!?! Everyone else, even the excellent Doug Jones are just somewhat flat.

Flat leads nicely into the score. The music is AWFUL! The battle music lacks drama. the general ambient music is dull and lifeless and the theme itself seems like several ill-fitting tunes mashed together in the dark! All the in-show music sounds as if it were performed on a Casio keyboard from 1988. Where has the drama gone? We all remember the ridiculous Spock Vs. Kirk fight from TOS (brilliantly parodied in The Cable Guy) Dun dun dunnnnnn dunnnnn dunnnn! Or the excellent alien battle music from the TOS movies. Each side having their own distinct battle music! where did it go wrong!?!

The sets aren't bad. It all looks very shiny and expensive, but the aliens...erm, somebody needs to tell the make-up folks to ease up! the Klingons can barely turn their heads, or talk for that matter! I feel great pity for those actors. If there is an award for on-set suffering, these guys are a shoe-in!

This show doesn't really feel like Star Trek, and that's OK. Change is nothing to be feared. The problem here is some of the production values. A weak script, very weak music, cheesy unnecessary action moments, some slightly inconsistent visual effects and illogical decisions being made by logical people. All serve to ruin what could have been a winner.

Watchable, but you will find yourself wincing occasionally at the dialogue and ""action"".",3 October 2017
"Most of the negative reviews for 'STD' (didn't anyone notice that acronym when choosing the title??) are of the form: ""This isn't Star Trek!!"" That may be true, but I'm not sure it's a valid reason for hating the show.

Like any long-time Trek fan, I'm not happy seeing a Trek series primarily about war, as opposed to... well, you know: *discovery.* But on the other hand, given that this is a prequel to The Original Series, maybe it's not completely unreasonable to tell the story of how mankind managed to abandon warfare and grow up.

Meanwhile, there are several things I do like about STD, so far. The characters are strong and vivid. The setup for Michael Burnham is clever, and gives some real edge to the character. Sonequa Martin-Green is effective and likable in the part. I equally like Captain Lorca. This guy really takes the make-your-own-rules clichés of the other Trek captains and pushes them to the limit. I even like the supporting characters, especially Mary Wiseman as Sylvia Tilly. And I enjoyed the reboot of Harry Mudd as a truly evil collaborator.

These characters share a trait notably missing from other Trek incarnations: they're all deeply flawed. That makes them inherently more interesting than the straight-arrow super-humans that manned previous Trek missions.

As drama, as entertainment, Star Trek Discovery is doing pretty well. It's not abysmally stupid, like the JJ Abrams films. It sticks to its own logic. It has characters that ring true. It has a story that keeps moving, and offers interesting twists and turns.

Is it truly 'Trek'? I think it's too soon to tell. The voyage has only just begun, and the destination is not yet clearly visible. I may be a purist, but I'm not a fanatic: I *expect* a new Trek property to re-invent, re-interpret, bring a new sensibility. The question is, does it succeed on its own terms? Based on what I've seen so far, I'll offer a cautious up-vote - and reserve the right to revise either upward or downward as the series evolves.

EDIT February 2021:

I've finally given up on this series. The latest season is pure hot garbage. Never mind the absurd premise (a trip to the future OF the future)... the series rarely makes any logical or dramatic sense - characters act in ways that might seem plausible only to a group of utterly unskilled writers, working late at night while severely intoxicated. For instance: how could any captain abruptly pick the most junior officer on his ship to be second in command? This is the same sort of lunatic plotting that killed the last two Trek movies, and I can only blame the one obvious common factor, Alex Kurtzman.

On top of this sufficiently fatal flaw, the series has entirely lost its way as far as TONE. This is no longer an adventure, it's an angst-filled trough of cheap emotional drivel. Characters are forever either blubbering or hugging, even when neither is appropriate to the storyline. This feels like a forced attempt to to make the series 'warm and fuzzy,' but it falls flat because it's simply not organic. Genuine emotion must be earned by a storyteller; it can't be sledgehammered on top of flimsy characterizations and unconvincing dramatics.

Finally, while past seasons have had some truly great episodes, this year even the latest Frakes-directed episode is rubbish. There's nothing left to hope for.

I'm altering my rating from my original optimistic 8/10 down to 2/10, and adding a caution that anyone who truly loves Trek or great SF or deep characterizations or masterful storytelling should stay far, far away from this monstrosity. See the excellent Picard series, then do yourself a favor and stop. (And hope that at least one of the upcoming Trek series can buck the trend and provide some shred of entertainment value.)",12 November 2017
"A couple of intro interviews describe the show as a 15 hour movie. I'm definitely not interested in that type of television. They tried it with the 3rd season of Star Trek Enterprise and it resulted in the show being cancelled -- which was a shame since the 4th season was quite good.

I just finished the opening episode and it looks like it's going to be that type of crap. Very, very disappointed.

Are they serious about adding more and more emotional drama? A computer having emotional issues??? Is this star trek, a sci-fi action show? Or a 4pm tv novel?

I cannot keep watching after chapter 4-6.

"If you loved Star Trek Original, Next Generation or Deep Space 9 I'd say you'd find this TERRIBLE. This is terrible similar to the recent franchise movies released.

Start Trek for me is about moving the human existence into a setting/context where you have freedom to explore an incredible amount of creative ideas. Thus, the Original, Next Generation and Deep Space 9 are the best pieces of TV/Movie history.

I'd suggest if you're a true fan, skip and do not support anything where the corporation is looking for a ""money maker"". Better watch fan-based materials, or re-watch the originals.

Discovery seems as a corporate made up runner against Disney's Star Wars. Seems just as ""we have our own horse for competing against Disney in this area"". Who-ever came up with this should not work in this industry ever. Filled with dirty ideology, mainly those of populism (make decisions based on what the decision makers idea of what popular is at the moment). Leaves you with an aftertaste of a future universe filled with toughness as the main value, hypocrisy/""fake-ness"" (machiavellism, let's pretend that we're something we're not or let's pretend that we're something we're not by showing others that we can be all kinds of people as needed) as main social values.

Story.

Action-based, shoot-hide-attack and all resolved by a ""genius"" ideas in the realm of ""we're tougher than they are"". On top repetitive. Thus, spitting on the Start Trek realm directly.

Acting.

Superficial. Really bad. In most scenes you can see that the actors are going out of the roles (e.g. Their looks and behaviors contain a ""have I've done this right?"" look addressed to the director or whoever). Just listen the series without watching and listening to the dialogue meaning, the prosody of speech just repeats from scene to scene - best way to make anything dull.

Casting.

Also terrible, and let the corporate lobby indulge the ""safe"" fake ""diversity"" by ""race"", ""gender"", ""sexuality"", and whatever is now popular in US media as a ""value"". Note, if you're using the word ""race"" you are a racist - that's seems to be something that most Americans do not understand if you're looking at mainstream media narratives academically.

So, a state of non-racism/not-whatever-ism is a state where you're not mentioning, or forcing, any decisions based on this. In other words, the choices seem forced as they do not fit the Star Trek narrative where you'll find the best narrative to go about ""races"", ""genders"", ""sexuality"" (e.g. Watch the TNG's 5th season episode about genderless race - are the full TNG that has a complex dialogue about all of these issues).

In order to understand how to properly do this you need to understand Gene Roddenberry's main ideas, where the Original series went and why TNG/DS9 were so different.

Similar force-full casting was done on a completely destroyed corporate version of Isaac Asimov's Foundations,...

Visuals. Who cares about visuals?? This was supposed to be Star Trek and not your regular block buster bs.

Audio.

TNG's theme is a great piece of modern/contemporary writing. Discovery's theme, music and audios are a ""let's use one those movie themed libraries that we got from X publisher on discount last year, just throw something monumental/serious sounding"". Will not stick in your had or come up ever evoking great moments of the series, it is more likely that you'll feel tired and eager to listen to some good music after in order to ""clean"" your ears and forget the audio aftertaste of the Discovery.",3 December 2021

"It's a crying shame that this series has become more lost than any Star Trek vessel ever has. The writers have created a crew that is so politically correct and so soft and so whiny that it appears there may be no turning back. Maybe Discovery was re-created for a new generation of Star Trek viewers. Viewers that are more sensitive and that is fine but what about the generations that have grown up with every Star Trek series ever created. They have forgotten that we expect a certain amount of realism. I do not expect mindless entertainment with explosions and shoot outs and bad storylines please make this more believable. It seems every character in the series put on a whiny face this fake soft sensitive voice and then they carry out these unbelievable task of convincing everyone to just get along. And I am not against promoting social reform but please be a little more realistic. This season is dull boring and completely unbelievable and truly lacks entertainment value. Can somebody tell me please what happened to Captain Burnham's and Book's characters? Where is their tenacity and boldness? Why is this character Tilly always so diplomatic? How did she make LT, When she can't issue direct orders to anyone? And what is the purpose of showing Adira in every episode.

"From the Kelvin-style of ships, to the bad dialogue, horrid writing, and SJW message, there really isn't much good to say about this show. The actors and actresses did the best they could I'm sure, but the storyline is so SJW-laden as to be unwatchable if you are not of a Progressive political persuasion. Even a Liberal (Classical) like myself had trouble with the in-your-face blatant SJW nonsense from the hyper-feminist lead character who is borderline Mary-Sue, to the theistic Klingons that Aaron Harberts said represent Trump-supporters (something CBS is now back-peddling on). The whole show is garbage and what is worse is that an amateur copyright-infringing fan-film maker (Alec Peters) did a better job at modernizing the TOS era for the 21st Century and creating a Star Trek-lore compliant pre-TOS story. That's sad considering CBS/Paramount own the IP and are treating it worse than some fan-film maker. STD deserves its acronym, and is a 1-star production in my view. I will not be paying to watch this tripe.",28 September 2017

"I was excited for a modern star trek with fancy effects, and the CGI is quite good here, but the plot is laughable. Or at least I would laugh if I wasn't too busy rolling my eyes.

It seems the writers were too busy cramming their woke agenda down your throat to actually think about the plotline or character development. The main character just fumbles her way to inevitable victory in every situation, learning nothing from the experience.

If you want to have gender diverse characters that's perfectly fine. But don't define the character by that trait alone, and stop beating the audience over the head with it every chance you get.

Absolute worst show I've suffered through in a long time. Don't make the same mistake.",30 March 2022
"I start with the good things in the show which are only a few: Anson Mount in season 2 as captain was great and believable. Michelle Yeoh as captain at the start of the show was also good and believable. Tig Notaro is ok as an engineer and the doctor is ok, too. Otherwise, the show falls completely apart. The story does not fit into canon, the ships' interiors are large enough to hide Coruscant, the story has huge and obvious holes in it and the worst thing: the characters are flat, uninteresting and not believable as (space) naval crew and officers.",9 January 2021

"I have never seen such a significant amount of low rated reviews, and I share my disappointment.

I grew up with 'The Next Generation', a show started by Roddenberry, following the same narrative. What drew me to the series was adventure, sense of drive and purpose and morals of the story-lines, something that has been lost in this series.

I have waited for what seemed an eternity for the next installment of Star Trek, have followed DS9, Voyager and I probably like many had high hopes for Enterprise. So with the announcement of Discovery I held my breath hoping.

Having been inundated with 'Multi-verse' franchising, across many comics and shows, including the recent Abrams Star Trek trio, I was dubious going into this series.

Star Trek Discovery lacks the essence of what made the original series, Generations and to some extent DS9 (although darker) and Voyager great. Even to that point it is also what made the Abrams trio enticing too. The constant struggle with our own humanity, the strive for a Utopian inspired future, to better ones self and the ability to confront an conquer moral and ethical challenges.

Right out of the gate a mutiny, now for the right reasons? But written poorly, more it would seem for the characters sake and plot involvement than ethical delema.

The actors, writers and directors may indeed be trying to move this franchise in a new direction, but to what end? The writing and acting can be decidedly wooden, even for the Burnham character.

With the writing and acting often cluttered and unfocused the action scenes and CGI do a lot to lift this series, hats off to that team, they haven't missed on that note.

In the end they have changed to much to fast, leaving the essence of Star Trek behind, we can only wait to see where they take us next.",23 February 2018
"Absolutely terrible. Season 1 was pretty good so I was looking forward to season 2, but two episodes in, and it's been absolutely disappointing so far. Acting is pretty bad, which is surprising as the same actors in S1 did a good job so it must be the cringe-worthy script. There is very little story, the episodes are all over, despite the big build up. Recycled ideas, too much special effects - everything seems off about this new season.",4 February 2019

"First off this isn't Star Trek, It's sci-fi but it's not Star Trek no matter what they call it. And it's really bad sci-fi at that. It's really nothing more than just terrible fanfic. It's preachy social justice tripe. There's exactly one white heterosexual male - who of course was evil in the first season. Everyone else is female and alien - mostly female aliens. The second season is even worse than the first. It really needs to be killed off at this point. I'm simply amazed it hasn't been by this point in time.

While the technical aspects of the production are standard fare they're nothing great. The acting, on the whole, is terrible as well, the lead character especially. For someone who was raised on Vulcan in their tradition she's constantly melodramatic with most of he lines delivered in a breathy whisper. She clearly has no grasp or ability for dramatic acting.

TNG was the last real Trek. I doubt we'll ever see anything again that even comes close to approaching that level of quality in writing and acting. CBS is just flogging the name to make some quick cash. Shame on them. Poo r Gene Rodenberry would be spinning in his grave if he could see how they've trashed his work.",14 February 2019

"After watching all existing Star Trek episodes, I'm still very confused by STD. Season 1 was a mess, but it had a constant storyline with a twist. Mistakes were made but they were noticed. Season 2 was almost a masterpiece, connecting TOS and STD in incredible way. Ye, it still was mess in terms of character development, but each episode had a plot and very intriguing to watch next one. Captain Pike and Spock were almost perfect. And I think last episode of STD has right to be called Star Trek Discovery. Season 3: Here comes Star Trek: Burnam. There is no more Discovery. Well, It exists as a ship, but there are no more characters except Michael Burnam. Every single episode is about Michael. P.S: There are many stupid things in that series. Discovery is hacked using SQL-injections (really? in a 24th century a unique starship can be hacked using 1990-s techniques?) or when Saru reads a photo because a computer can't magnify it, but his eyes can... Same happens later with sound. Dear screenwriters, please, go away and leave your place for professionals, or at least Google it before putting it on screen.",6 December 2020

Star trek gave me hope for the future of mankind, made me want to believe in the best of what we could be. It significantly shaped my morals and outlook on life growing up.

And then i got to see Discovery, and it killed all hope in my heart for any future. I would love to live in the world of TNG or DS9, but it would be a nightmare to find myself in the DIS universe.

Discovery, there goes your credibility. Next everybody mourning the loss of Gerogiou.

I am on the verge of ceasing viewing of this show.",17 August 2022
"I was hoping for some character based, hard science fiction. This is not that.

The show is glitzy, with millions lavished on cgi. They desperately want you to judge it cool. Dialog is spartan, efficient and easy to digest. They desperately want to make sure nobody is confused. The characters have been honed via writing by committee and focus testing. They desperately want you to not dislike anyone. The plot is basic: two sentence simple. Again, they don't want anyone confused. Humour is absent.

The show mass market confection, and easily forgotten. It is the science fiction equivalent of The Olive Garden.",26 September 2017
"StarTrek Discovery (""STD"") series misses the mark and isn't the Star Trek we have known to love. Good luck naming the bridge crew because I watched the first 4 season and it's ever changing by each episode. One season of STD has more crying than the entire series of NG, Voyager and DS9 combined. Season 3 and 4 are an utter waste of time. Michelle Yeoh was amazing and the best in performance. STD should have kept her an axed Burnham. Had STD kept Yeoh, this show could have been something. Michael Burnham is a horrible character, a criminal, and doesn't value Starfleet ideals, yet she gets promoted every season probably because STD is fixated on race and gender, not merit. Honestly if I could give this series a negative rating, I would. StarTrek Picard is leagues better if you are looking something more like the traditional StarTrek franchise. I don't know who is to blame for this garbage but after Season 2, this series should have been cancelled.",30 November 2023
"I've given the snow the benefit of the doubt for the first season and into the second, but I'm past the point of patience. Schmick CGI, and fancy effects side, this has no relation to the last 50 years of Trek stories and lore.

Corny characters, sub par storylines, Deus ex machina plot devices such as the spore drive, all make for forced drama and no real feel of Star Trek.

We've somewhere lost the ideas driving Roddenberry's vision of a multicultural, largely utopian future, with gimmicky effects, paper thin characters, and science-defying concepts. The original series and Next Gen at least tried to predict technological developments, based on existing or new science, whereas lazy writing simply, and magically, resolves any trouble the crew may find themselves in.

Really, if you took away the title, this could be a thin excuse for any other sci-fi tv series out there. I don't know what it is, but it's definitely not Trek.",27 January 2019
"OK, let the diatribe commence.....

Where should I begin? I honestly don't know where to begin because in my opinion... nothing, and I mean literally NOTHING is right, or good about this show.

Let's all be honest and face the truth that this iteration of ""Star Trek"" bears absolutely no resemblence, or connection with any of the previous iterations of this excellent franchise. It fails in virtually every single sense -acting, production, scriptwriting, direction etc etc..... and so on.

When I watch STD it feels as if a cohort of social justice warrior types have ganged up and somehow gained total control over one of the biggest sci-fi franchises to have ever existed. Having realised they have control of a vast budget and a whole 50 year canon to explore they have inexplicably decided to stomp all over established lore, waste tons of money on admittedly excellent CGI but that in fact adds nothing to the narrative, and in thier 'woke' arrogant self entitlement chose to systematically dismantle, and destroy the original vision of the shows creator - The late great Mr Roddenberry.

Now I understand and have always appreciated that Trek has a moral message, and that it challenges the conceptions of the day - It's one of best aspects of Trek. I get to see aliens, androids, phasers, and starships, but I also get a little education in how to be a better human. Sometimes I go away from watching an episode and consider ethical questions I never even realised had been posed. Trek used to achieve this in a subtle, and entertaining way with decent storywriting, plots, lots of cool futuristic tech (based on sound scientific principles), and for the most part good acting while understanding that first and foremost Trek is about the science fiction and not the drama.

STD seems to have decided on a different philosophy which really bears no resemblence.

STD seems to have decided that as a viewership we are too stupid to know what is right and how we should behave to each other., and that they, in thier enlightened 'woke' state know better. Not only do they show disdain by assuming this but they seem to have made it thier mission to relentlessy and violently cram thier woke views down our throats throughout every single episode. Sadly this really affects the quality of the Sci Fi show they're supposed to be making....

The next issue I have is the unbelievably poorly written characters - They have no emotional resonance whatsoever, I couldn't give a toss about any of them and thier petty little crap - which is suprising when you think about how often the crew argue and cry on the bridge, and pretty much anywhere else!. These people are supposed to be starfleet academy graduates and trained military personnel. Do you think would Picard, Kirk, Sisko, or Janeway would start crying during a critical battle? Fudge no!!!!

Finally I can't abide the terrible dumbing down of the scientific principles which Trek has always adhered to, and of the stupid vapid plot arcs with stupid vapid endings. The red wake? Please!. I find it insulting that the writers think we're that easily pleased. This isn't the 60's and we expect more from our TV, and no amount of insanely good CGI is going to cover up this travesty of a show.

To sum up - nothing like real Trek, I won't be watching season 4, Please kill it soon, and if you want to watch real Trek ..... watch 'The Orville'

Phew, diatribe over :-)))))))",20 October 2021
"Someone before me wrote that the cast was fantastic. I couldn't disagree more. Sonequa Martin-Green's face expressions are same as Steven Seagal's. Anthony Rapp could not be more fake. Anson Mount as the captain, well, absolutely weightless.

"ST:D (What an abbreviation) not only lets down its core fans by delivering an experience that didn't fit the Star Trek universe, it also let down those who thought it might be interesting to see what the federation would do if they for once didn't manage to find a peaceful solution.

It features multiple plot twists which feel random instead of believable, character behavior that's just random - not character development and not staying true to the character either.

It had a few moment where I thought: If they do this right this could still be a great show! Each of them was a letdown.

"So. . . . As a big fan of Star Trek and especially the future that will be someday, if we do not blow ourselves up before we figure out intergalactic star travel I can only say that this ""Discovery"" is unwatchable.

Acting: Poor to non-existent. Script: Who the F . . . Wrote it? They should not be allowed to ever write any scripts. Camera work: Subpar. Klingons: Did not see one Klingon. What they wanted to be passed as Klingons was W. The Actual. F. . . Storyline: There was none.

This was beyond disappointing. Star Trek Enterprise is ""hated"", but still it is far better than Star Trek DS9. My favorite though is Star Trek Voyager after Star Trek Enterprise.

Even when I saw the trailer and the casting, I knew that this will be a Cluster F . . . . of a series. Wasted opportunity.

I suggest that the series would be cancelled immediately and that if they want to reboot Star Trek, which would be great to get enthusiastic creators who understand Star Trek Universe.

If you value your time, avoid at all costs. This ""Star Trek"" wannabe creation is a disgrace to the whole franchise.",18 November 2017
"I really enjoyed season 1 and 2, but season 3 is getting harder and harder to stand. I think I have one episode left to watch in this season, and the explanatione for the secret that kept the season going is unbelievably disappointing. Yes, Star Trek has always been about feelings, compassion, etc... But season 3 seems to have forgotten about the Sci-Fi that most fans still expect. The science deck has now become LGBT HQ, where oversensitive symbionts and gay crew go to speak their language. Nothing wrong with addressing diversity, but pushing the issue with every episode is becoming stale. Sympathy is turning to boredom.

I have no idea who greenlighted the scripts. I think that the very large majority of negative comments about season 3 will convince the showrunners to fire the writers and abandon them on a distant planet. So far, this year, Discovery has been one disappointment after the other.",27 December 2020

Having different races and gay characters etc is fine as that's inclusive, but to intentionally exclude a massive part of a 55 year fan base isn't wise.

Season 1 was really good. Season 2 fell off a bit but was still watchable.

If I was searching for a positive in this - there are occasionally some cool (never fun) ideas and scientific what ifs that make you think, but again none of them ever matter and often in this series they find a way to vip to another universe, another time, another story and revert their own stories.

It feels that the script writers played to their strengths and focussed on exploring emotions of all the characters and pretty much gave up on coming up with new ideas which made star trek so exciting.",4 January 2021

"Maybe if the Orville wasnt produced, then this ""true StarTrek"" would be passable.

But when a comedy show like the Orville, is closer to your origin than the ""main"" show would ever be, then i cant just give it a 5/10, Its 1 now.",10 November 2020
"I was looking forward to this new star trek series. I'm not a big fan of the latest movies as they felt more like fast & the furious in space than star trek but I figured they're not connected to the tv series so I wasn't going to judge discovery on that. And I thought the recent movies were fun to watch anyway with plenty of nods to the originals.

I've liked every star trek series from the moment I started watching it. The original. Next gen. DS9. Voyager. Enterprise. Discovery changed that. I watched 3 episodes and had no interest in watching any more. I've heard it gets better in season 2 but you really shouldn't have to watch a whole season of a show for it to get good. I think a few episodes is enough to give it a solid chance. After all, pilot episodes are usually made specifically to grab viewer interest. Discovery failed to hold my interest after 3.

So what didn't I like about Discovery? Well let's start with the main character. I can't get excited about a character who's insufferably perfect. Each episode I watched seemed to follow the same pattern repeatedly. I.e. Superior officer makes a decision. Main character smugly opposes superior officer and ends up being right. Repeat. I just found her un-relatable and un-likeable. An insufferable know it all. I know it's not a problem with the actor since I loved her character in The Walking Dead.

The Klingons - what the heck where they thinking with the Klingons? They speak ridiculous. They look ridiculous. As far as I've seen there's no explanation for them looking so ridiculous and so different from any other klingons we've seen. In a big budget show they literally look like actors in bad latex masks that they can't talk properly through.

The whole tone of the show was completely wrong for star trek. They seem determined to make it dark and gritty. Why not leave that up to shows like The Expanse or Altered Carbon (or even the 2003 battlestar galactica reboot) that do dark and gritty sci-fi. Discovery certainly doesn't and no other trek show even tried to be like that.

I know it gets said a lot but The Orville is a var better star trek series even though it's not actually a star trek series. Characters you can like and relate to. Stories you can relate to. It actually feels like trek. I'll stick with The Orville.",16 March 2019
"Having been an avid fan of Star Trek for 50+ years, the past 2 seasons of discovery have been terrible and unworthy of the Star Trek name. Star Trek has always been in the forefront of diversity with Ohura, Chekhov, and Sulu as key bridge characters in the original Star Trek, Benjamin Cisco as the captain in DS9, and Janeway as the captain in Voyager - Always pushing our thinking, without slapping us in the face. Discovery lost this balance.

While there was an occasional ""love"" connection (Ex: Paris & Torres, Chakotay & Seven in Voyager), it was never central to the theme of adventure (""boldly going where no one has gone before"").

Discovery comes across as an endless soap opera of love stories (Ex: Burnham-Booker,Burnham-Tyler, Stamets-Culber, Adira-Tal, Saru-T'Rina). While any single love story could have been OK, the endless relationship drama make Discovery a Sci-Fi ""Another World"", rather than Star Trek.

While the actors are very good, the writing is sadly terrible and unworthy of Star Trek.",22 March 2022
"Not Star Trek at all

All this show does is destroy a franchise that has bought so many people hours and hours of entertainment. Im not sure what gives the creators the idea that the lead character Michael Burnham is like-able what so-ever (not to mention how average her acting is). And she seems to be surrounded by less than average actors with the exception of Saru (Doug Jones) who in the end was the only reason I continued to finish the second season out.

If a third season comes, which I have read will - It will not be getting a watch from me.

3 stars for the terrific FX, credit where credit is due",16 December 2019
"I'm a Trekkie, I have watched every single episode of TOS, TNG, DS9, VOY, Enterprise over and over and over and over again.

I haven't made it through a single full episode of Discovery. I've tried but my attention drifts as I just turn off/lose interest halfway through.

The Klingons are awful. Joyless 'evil' non-entities, obviously 're-imagined' by the same person that designed Idris Elba's makeup in the equally awful Star Trek: Beyond.

Klingons were space vikings, lived life to the full, drank, fought, living life with honour and a huge slice of joy.

Michael Dorns football head in ST:TNG S1 was more watchable than the Klingons in this abomination.

Shaka, when the walls fell... :(",26 October 2017
"I'm not complaining about the social issues, Star Trek always did social issues. Remember ST-IV saved the whales.

But dangit, Kirk and Picard never needed a whole season to solve one problem. Sheesh. Write some episodes people.

Season two just feels like a mess. They decided they were going to wedge in Spock somehow, but really didn't have an idea of what the story should be. Kirk would have ripped his shirt off, slapped the uber evil AI with the sweaty remnants and then laid a sloppy kiss on Michael's mom in the first episode of the season (real Spock would have figured out everything by the second commercial so we could get the the swell action). Picard would have negotiated a temporal accord with the AI over tea, Earl Grey, hot. And then Riker would have slapped a sloppy kiss on Michael's mom.

I can see the retcon coming now. At some point when it's time to close out the series Ma' Burnham is going to successfully go back and save the kid and her dad so she never gets adopted by the Spocksons. Fine.

This whole season feels as painful as though they stretched Spock's Brain into 13 episodes. It makes baby tribbles cry. At least they haven't screwed up Pike (yet).

Episodes! Episodes! And remember. Star Trek is in a hopeful future. If you want to be dark and edgy go write for The Expanse.",4 April 2019
"Really nothing at all like Star trek, but they use the name of star trek to get a build in audience of millions. Very odd show, that relies mostly on style, fighting, disagreements, CGI and a future that is bleak, dark and not appealing. It is as if it is not even star trek, other than using names and a few ideas from star trek. A show that is depressing, and not even all that interesting on its own story wise. SAD!",19 June 2018
"Star Trek = inspirational family show Star Trek: Discovery = Not Star Trek, not so inspirational and not a family show

I give a 0 out of 10 for a Star Teck show. I can see a 14-year-old muggle giving it a 7 out of 10. I only made it through the first two seasons. Maybe a miracle happened and it improved. I will never know.

I would have enjoyed it if they had just made a new space opera not related to Star Trek. Call it something like Extreme Space Woke and the starship Agenda and maybe have a space station called Hedonism and put it on Cinamax. Now that would be a show that could be fun to watch. Oh, wait, that sounds like The Orville, I love that show!

I do not blame the actors. I was a fan of Sonequa Martin-Green in The Walking Dead and was excited when I heard she would star in the new Star Trek. So it goes for Sasha Williams and the Star Trek Franchise. She went out like a champ in Walking Dead, maybe Ms. Burnham can do the same.

I do take comfort in envisioning the investors who financed this mess will be writing off $3000 a year in losses for the rest of their lives.

"If it wasn't for Phillipa Georgeuo I wouldn't watch it and that's from a hard core Trek fan. There is way too much hugging and crying. Seriously they are a command and control outfit Picard listened to people & then decided what to do. Discovery is supposedly set before TNG but is run like some free for all democracy. It lacks a Captain, direction and overall meaning it just lurches from Episode to Episode pandering to the latest SJW fad. This is totally the opposite of what TNG did, which actually challenged perceptions of social norms within a 'realistic' future.",14 November 2020
"I LOVE STAR TREK! I HATE THIS! No really... I HATE IT! It's so bad that there is no better word. HATE!

"I have to speak up. I just saw the first 3 episodes of Star Trek: Discovery and I find it to be the biggest piece of crap on television. It seems it producers and writers have never seen an episode of Star Trek. They borrowed elements of every sci fi movie or series possible. The Klingons seem to have become Goa'uld from Stargate, the 'Blink drive' is from Dark Matter or Dune. The shows main character is a total loser, no one raised by a Vulcan would even attempt or contemplate mutiny. Also, her command of the english language also falls short for someone of her upbringing. And, of all Vulcans, why Sarek. So Spock has an adopted sister never before mentioned, ANYWHERE. The ships captain is a total nut case bent on killing everything in his path, including his own people. I haven't found one single person on the ship I can truly like. They all seem a bit whiny. Plot lines and character development are non existent. Sorry CBS, but you blew it, big time. Don't waste your time with this stinker.",15 December 2021
"I don't know why this show exists - it not only contradicts and invalidates ST lore, it manages to contradict itself. If this show didn't have the Star Trek name it wouldn't have any viewers - the only reason it even has a 7/10 rating is because of bots and deleting negative reviews.

It's also ironic that a show that bills itself as 'progressive' is so regressive. If you want more Star Trek, watch The Orville or Strange New Worlds. If you like nonsensical plot lines and watching people cry ALL. THE. TIME, then watch this I guess.",1 July 2022
"Such high hopes for this show, and such a bad outcome. This show did so many things wrong, I'm not even sure where to begin. Characters? Acting? Dialogue? Editing? Special effects? Storytelling? Camera work? Lore? They are all, in a general sense, quite bad.

Minus a promising beginning that goes nowhere and quickly dives of a cliff, this show is such a jumbled mess of bad things that it actually becomes hard to decipher which contributes more to its low quality. This is the first Star Trek show that I have discovered that not only has no re-watchable factor, it is the first that I have no intentions of going back to at all. Some of the most cringe worthy moments in television history that I have seen happened in this show.

First off, none of the characters are likable or believable, least of all the main character. It's not believable that most of these characters would be professionals onboard starships, let alone allowed onboard one at all. They are all childish, selfish, insufferable, cringe worthy characters. You want to hate them right away and that never gets any better. I never felt a connection or any interest in a single character the entire time I was watching. It is like watching an angsty teenage drama set in space.

Second, the acting can be down right horrible. Some do an alright job, but most of it is either totally over-the-top, or way under-acted. The main character is the worst of the bunch. Some of the shots where they pan around and do these up-close moments, are some of the worst scenes ever made. It would be better if they actually made you want to feel something for what is happening on screen: suspense, sorrow, fear, or anything really, rather than trying to force you to feel something using cheap camera work and nothing else. If they did, it might make those close-up, panning shots actually mean something.

Third, the dialogue can be some of the worst I have ever heard in a show, let alone a big budget one. The things characters say are just downright horrendous, cheesy, and unbelievable for the types of characters these should be, and the types of situations they find themselves in. Once again, childish, selfish, insufferable, and cringe worthy.

Fourth, the editing here is minor league for some reason. It is what one might expect from a much lower budget show. It can be distracting where they do cuts, how they interpret scenes, jump around, and cobble things together. I expected better from a show with the money this one supposedly has. It reminded me, like so many other parts of this show, like Stargate: Universe.

Fifth, the special effects look like they belong in a ten year old video game, not a modern science fiction show. The onscreen effects, light flares, bloom/blur thing, space scenes, etc., all look like a video game and are often distracting. The space scenes tend to be unrealistic and over the top, and while the ships and environments are detailed, most of them aren't believable as being functional, really places and things. On occasion they get something right, but for the most part it is just so wrong.

Sixth, the storytelling is, well, it's there. Kind of tacked on for good effect most of the time, but it's there. The story in this show takes a back seat to the action, and even when it does factor in it is generally a poor amalgamation of awkward characters, camera work, and bad dialogue. It's not believable and it disappoints at every turn, and is made worse by a total lack of them asking themselves if anything makes sense given the characters and the context on screen. The storytelling here is the worst of any Star Trek.

Seventh, the camera work is the worst I have ever seen. The angles they shoot from are disorienting and distracting. It makes no sense why they are doing most of the things they are doing with the camera, and it often detracts from what might otherwise be a redeemable moment. It's like they are trying to inject suspense into a scene rather than creating it organically, and it really shows.

And finally, this show not only displays no respect for the lore of the franchise, it actively goes out of its way to throw it on the ground, spit on its face, and grind it under its heels. Every change they have made is for the worse. Every one of them. They honestly couldn't care less about making anything fit in with established anything. Probably one of the worst elements.

If I had to come up with one word to explain the core principle of this show, the one word behind every thought, action, and motivation of those who made it, that word would be: Superficial. I can literally see them asking: is this superficial enough to be in the show?

Unfortunately, and with great disappointment, I would give this one a miss.",15 March 2018
"This is basically a mediocre soap opera with a scifi setting. No character is enjoyable, no plot is to be found here, and its generally so bad that if we treated it as Canon to the rest of the franchise, it would ruin the other series. Season 1 had rough patches but had a great twist ending and was enjoyable even if it wasn't Trek. Then the writers decided this would be the Michael Burnham show and went off to write that series instead. There is no believable character development, there are no episodes that stand well on their own, the stories are all contrived cliches. Don't bother with this dumpster fire of a show.",1 February 2023

"Now i understand why Brian Fuller had to quit production team. Discovery has nothing to do with Roddenbery's Star Trek. You can sum up Writers and Director with ""They just don't get it"". As a regular Sci-Fi show Star Trek: Discovery is a maybe a 5 out of 10. As a Star Trek series 1 out 10. I am really disappointed.",14 October 2017
"I tried to give it a chance but sadly I only managed to make it to the Midway First Season Point, and even then, it was tough I think I might have start checking out about the second episode in but decided to go as fare as I can about it. Sadly, that wasn't too far as I have just started. I really wished this was better because I'm really in to Star Trek. I really wanted to be a Dedicated Viewer of this show. What I really hate about it is that the Warp Technology or whatever that Drive is I Honesty Can't remember. Just feels like some kind of Miracle Magical Machin, that type of Tech doesn't seem Plausible, in a Sci Fi Film, that's like coming up with some sort of all powerful spill that would solve all of the world's problems like Defeating The Ultimate Bad and His Demon Minions And all of his Evil Dragons or whatever in a Fantasy Film with out much or any Effort on our Hero's part which goes for finding practicing and using that same said spill. Or in a Saw Film the Kidnapped Person happens to find a Key that would allow that person to Unlock all of the Traps and all of the Doors and all they need to do is just reach over with out having their Arm Cut Off or whatever. In All Three cases it just Feels Too Convenient, and Unrealistic. Anyways back to Discovery speaking of it just Feels like Animal Cruelty, by Placing Those Aline Life Forms in that Chamber so they Could Use that Miracle Magical Device. And the Worst Part is the characters don't seem to Notice or Care all they Seem to Care about is Using That Miracle Magical Device. And I have to say I never really Cared about any of the Characters, in fact I found at least one of them Really Idiotic and Annoying. Which brings me to the Captain himself. I just hate how when it comes to that Miracle Magical Tech that I keep on Mentioning, he just seems like a Big Baby about it. By The way how he keeps on Refusing to Give it up, and doesn't Starfleet/Federation have the Authority to Force him to give That Technology Up or something? And as for the Design of the Klingons I'm just not a Fan of it. And as for the Episodes it's Feels Noncoherent. As with the Title of my Review this show completely Obturates the Continuity, since it's Supposed to Take place Fifty Years or so before The Original Series (TOS) Timeline, the (Shatner & Nimoy) Timeline and not the JJ Abrams Movie Timeline. One of the Frustrating for me is that The Creators of the show Doesn't seem to know anything about Star Trek Sadly.

I guess this goes with the Obliterate but why oh why would they Change 'Prim' Spock's Brother to a Sister? And as for the Uniforms they don't have any Clear Indications of what are their Functions. Where are the Yellow Uniforms? Where are the Red Uniforms? And where are the Blue Med Uniforms? Like in the other Star Trek Series. Even In Star Trak Enterprise they have a Small Line in their Uniforms to Indicate if they Are Red, Yellow or Blue Uniforms. And as for the Acting it is so Wooden. And I think the Worse Star Trak Sin Of all is Dumping Science for Pure Action. I just wished Creators of Marden Day Star Trek Would Stop Doing that with the Exception of Star Trek Picard, which is Deferent but still feels the same aside from having a few Familiar Faces Returning for the show, the same goes for Continuity for Star Trek Picard. Right now the Star Trek Franchise again aside from Star Trek Picard Feels more like the Star Wars Franchise, with the seemingly pure action of Star Trek. I Mean There's nothing wrong with mind you, just that In My Opinion if you want Pure Action just go watch Star Wars, and if you want just Science and Exploration, you should be able to watch Star Trek, but in these days, there doesn't seem to be any Deference. And I Personally what is this Series about there is No Mission or no Goal for the show? At least for The Original Star Trek Series the Mission of the Show is to Explore and maybe make ne friends and solve Conflicts.

But Fear not.......maybe it's not all bad. Sadly, the only Positive thing that I like about it is the Asian Female Captain in he first two episodes. She could have a whole Star Trek Series all on her on all they need to do is Hire Better Actors and along with that Creators that actually know Star Trek that actually watched the Old Star Trek Series any one of them up until Star Trek Voyager, and not these Sad Jokers. I really Hope for the Sake of the Show that they eventually Improve after watching any of the Old Star Trek Series for Research Sakes, but either way it is way too late for me.

My Finale Thoughts this show is Not Catered to the Old Star Trek Fans Such as myself it's only Catered to the Newer Star Trek Fans, which In My Opinion is a Big Mistake. I gave it a chance I really did until.....well if you read my whole whinny Review you already know how I feel with out Barrers as the Better Spock once said ""Captain I do not wish to Lie."" anyways if you're an Old Star Trek Fan such as myself and you too gave this show a chance and quit then you would know that sadly my whining is Justified.",6 November 2021

"As someone who only got into Star Trek in 2020, I don't consider myself one of the ""old gatekeepers"" who just like to complain about new things. I watched all of TNG, DS9, and Voyager in that order. Then I moved onto Discovery. I tried to accept that storytelling has changed in 20-30 years so naturally it was going to be a bit different, but overall it feels like it draws more from the Abrams movies than it does from the old series. Ignoring the fact that the way the ship operates makes no sense in the greater Star Trek timeline, the dialog and writing overall leave much to be desired. Characters on the bridge will be debating something, and someone will walk in from a different room and be a part of the debate without skipping a beat. That makes absolutely no sense. On the plus side, I love Saru and Tilly can be fun, but for the most part the only character who gets any development is Michael Burnham. Although there are many seemingly interesting characters, none of them are explored in the way non-captains were in previous shows. It might as well be called Star Trek: Michael Burnham. It's just disappointing. Another thing I dislike is that the plot lasts an entire season rather than being episodic. Here's hoping Strange New Worlds is better.",21 March 2022
"This is suppose to be ten years before the Enterprise, but the technology is 100 years ahead of the Enterprise, and the initial series was a manly man show, William Shatner was the MAN...here we have a black female first officer and an Asian Captain running the ship, that would never ever happen 10 years before Kirk, the Klingons were way overdone, way to much of everything, and I believe that Spock was the first multi racial Vulcan if I remember right, so how can this black female be half human and half Vulcan, and you can't tell what she is, she sure doesn't act like a Vulcan. Anyways, crappy show, won't watch the second episode, I had such high hopes for this. Way over tech, and way to politically correct, I'm surprised we didn't have a gay couple on there.",29 September 2017
"Isn't this supposed to take place ten years before TOS? There's nothing TOS about it except that the Klingons are an enemy, but they look and act nothing like TOS Klingons, nor Klingons from any other Trek series or movie. In fact, nothing looked anything remotely similar to TOS. It's like some weird dark alternate universe Trek.

And of course the story is nothing like a TOS episode — no hope or optimism about humanity or the universe, no sense of wonder — but rather apparently the start of a huge arc about a war. With f-bombs.

I just found it sad, and simply could not watch all the way through. I don't know who the target audience is for this show, but it certainly isn't me. Ironically, the Orville is much, much closer to being Star Trek than this show, and it's far more entertaining. So is the fan made Star Trek Continues. So is the 1960s British puppet show Space Patrol. So is . . .

I hope this show is cancelled soon. It's stinking up the Star Trek name.",24 September 2017

How can this be before Kirk and Spock? I dunno.

Was never a super fan of Star Trek.

Liked TNG and the movies with Kirk and Spock in the 80s.

As stand alone it is okay and somewhat entertaining but it isn't really true to the universe though.

Maybe I'm wrong. Rating seems to indicate enough people overlook these things.

"Season 3. Well!

Let's face it... Gene Roddenberry broke social ground. The first interracial kiss, racialism, war, politics. Once a week he would discuss/play out world matters. ONCE A WEEK. We all live in enlightened times, but when is enough enough?

Too much kissing, cuddling, crying, wailing and in the incessant ''I love you!'' A Human Trill that has an annoying partner that adds absolutely nothing to the plot and only goes to bolsters up a drive to be more socially inclusive. Well I say, ''jolly good for all you writers.'' And while you are indulging your own drive for social inclusion, embellished with a smothering of self importance - remember those loyal Star Trek followers that have followed the series for years and are getting tired of the incessant drudge and torrential deluge of political correctness that does not appear once in a while - but is forced upon us weekly.

The producers and director forgot a basic tenant of capturing and keeping an audience: story and characters come before special effects. You can have the greatest effects in the world, but if you story isn't compelling, and your characters lack depth, the audience will go away.

The original series understood that. TNG understood that. Hell, even DS9 and Voyager understood that. Strength comes from the story lines, not the effects.

Hey, maybe the second episode is better, but asking me to pay 9 bucks a month just to find out...there is other and better media around that won't cost me more money. So I am going to spend the 9 bucks at Starbucks and watch something else...until they release it on the CW.",24 November 2017

Series 04 of Discovery has just ruined a great series and turned it into a simpering mess of do gooders, doing the right thing ....yawn!

I now find it difficult to relate to most ......all of the characters who meander through this one main story series (lazy), to go off on tangents into boring story lines that just seem to get worse.

For the first time I will not finish the series and this is a sorry end to a great institution.",15 January 2022
"Cons:

It is more concerned about inclusiveness, cooperation and being woke than entertainment. All these points are overblown to ad nauseam in almost every..... single..... episode. Not that these aspects don't have their proper place in proper proportion - they do. However in this 'Trek' it's cloyingly excessive.

Then there's the whispering. Can we stop with the whispering that I can only assume is being used to convey gravitas. If it only lasted a minute in every other episode it may be tolerable. It's not. It seems that at five to ten minute intervals we're to be subjected to some oppressively overblown discourse in 'whisper' that drones on and on and on and on and on. (Get the point?)

Pros:

Amazing production. Good editing. Great CGI. Some refreshing new characters and personalities (some not).

Summary: It's watchable and does have exceptional moments. As someone who has been entertained by previous Star Trek series - this show is a disappointment - unless I remind myself while watching - to enjoy it as science fiction and not as a Star Trek.

(Even so.... I find myself needing the 'skip 10 seconds' on my remote to deal with the overplayed sermonizing far too often.)",13 January 2022

"Any show that pushes an agenda at the cost of it's entertainment value is doomed to failure. The most important thing about entertainment is that it be entertaining. All other factors are significantly less relevant. I want to like it because it is Sci-fi but it is painful to watch unless you are a Zombie.

"If the idea was to throw out cannon and create a new 'Star Trekish' program, good for the producers. If the idea was to poop on the heart of Star Trek and boldly go... well done.

This dark, violent and senseless world is populated with listless characters led by a Captain without a concience. We don't care about the characters because no time has been given to get us to care, or not care, about them. Since when has ANY Star Trek Captain been written as MEAN, sadistic and without consequence? Why is Michael Burnam the be-all, know it all, that has an answer for EVERYTHING. Doesn't make sense. You can't focus so much of the plot on one character. It robs the opportunity to BUILD a team of characters and set the tone for the show.

Just one of the biggest problems with the show is the technology. The tech is too advanced for the time setting. Particularly the engine drive. Stupid, stupid, stupid. It looks like the idea was just jump into a third season storyline and get the audience to play catch up. Screen Writing 101... characters and plot. You need to set those items up. This show has not. What a pile of steaming goo.

So, IMDB, how do you justify the high ratings for this mess of a show? Someone is manipulating the data. BE honest here. Someone hasn't been.

Giving this show a 2 only because I can't give it a 1½.",9 January 2018
"This series takes place before TOS, yet the tech exceeds TOS. Why not set it in another time period? Star Trek was about contemporary issues wrapped in future wisdom. Discovery is about expensive computer graphics, xenophobic aliens, and ""might is right"". Unfortunately it misses the mark set by TOS and TNG. I find it strange (funny) how another series about space exploration that was derived as a comedy is currently ""out-trekking"" Trek. Check out The Orville for some back to TNG style light hearted episodes of Wagon Train in space.

Sadly, I believe that network execs have ruined another great long term TV franchise. If you network suits really want to save this show, hit a Star Trek convention, scrape up some real die-hard trekkers, give them a fair budget to write stories, and then sign cheques and keep your mouths shut. Real fans of Star Trek will deliver the truest Star Trek experience.

If Discovery leaves you unfulfilled, ignore the professional critics and check out The Orville!",23 November 2017
"I agree with the reviews. I really wanted to like this show. I LOVE Star Trek. I've been watching it faithfully since I was a kid. I even prefer it to Star Wars, always have (don't judge!:) I couldn't wait for Star Trek to return to the small screen. I was so psyched and then I watched the premier and felt sick as did my teenage son who also loves Trek.

What have they done? Who let this group be in charge of such an historic and classic space saga like Star Trek? Did they not watch any Star Trek series' before? Even DS9 and Voyager in my opinion weren't great but they still felt like Star Trek. ""Discovery"" lacks its' Star Trek soul.

First off; There has always been a certain chemistry shared between the crew. I don't sense any here. 4 episodes in and I could still care less about any of their fates. No one stands out as likable or even interesting. Star Trek have always had interesting characters i.e. Data, Worf, Kirk, Spock, Seven of Nine and on and on. Try to pick one character that's interesting... I'm waiting.... thought not.

I agree with the other reviewers about the Klingons. I'm all for change but what the heck are we doing here? They are not intimidating or warrior like in the slightest. They sound like they are in absolute agony getting out their words. It's just strange.

This show is supposed to be 10 years BEFORE Kirk and the Enterprise right? What's with the advanced technology that we didn't even see in TNG? Did we devolve? When Star Trek has always been about evolving.

Star Trek has always been about discovering new world and new civilizations etc.. what are we doing here? It's supposed to be about humankind exploring. There's always been an innocence and naivety about humankind as we come up with these challenges. This is what I believe Roddenberry had in mind for Star Trek...not sure what we are doing here? Lastly; The ship ""Discovery"". It feels dark and suffocating. I get it's a smaller ship etc. but I feel claustrophobic watching it. Okay, we're trying to be ""gritty"" I guess...

My advice to the creators of this show is to hire a new show runner and new writers immediately! Over-haul or continue to your own demise because I can't imagine any ST fan enjoying this.",16 October 2017
"Every episode with the exception of a couple is centered around Burnham. Like she's the ultimate captain better than all of the rest of them combined. They have a great ensemble cast but don't use them except you support Burnham. It's annoying and taxing. I got as far as season 3 before I could no longer tolerate it. There a couple redeeming characters. The chief engineer is funny and sarcastic. The second command is an interesting take on an alien and the makeup as well done.

And you have their take on Star Trek history. The stock character is good and their take on Christopher Pike worked well with their spin off. But the only thing that saved the fact that this entire ship doesn't fit into the Star Trek universe, was that they threw them into the future. A annoying dystopian future were Burnham fixes everything. I recommend you watch strange new worlds if you've run out of old episodes of the original series and it's subsequent spinoffs starting with the next generation. The only thing that would save this show is if it was all a dream in data's head..... Or rather a nightmare.",11 April 2023
"This is not Star Trek. It's a scifi melodrama with a thin Star Trek skin on top of it.

I really wanted to like it and I kept going through 12 episodes of it! What was I thinking? I should have stopped after the 1st episode.

My biggest (one of many) complaint is the melodrama and the politically correct agenda that keeps getting shoved down your throat. EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER whines and cries about how insecure they are, not being able to do this, being afraid about that and on and on. The scenes are dragged out too when this happens to the point where you just end up skipping over the scenes before you start bashing your head against the wall. These are hardly qualities that befit a Starfleet officer, let alone one on a fairly important ship.

There are a lot of holes in the plot too. A lot of decisions just don't make sense with the biggest head scratcher being in the first episode with Michael and why...I won't say anymore due to spoilers

The Klingons! Ugh!! There was no need to reinvent an entire race (yes changes were made to the Klingons between TOS and NG. But they were pretty minor and they've stayed pretty much the same throughout 4 incarnations/series. This was just a move to put some dumba$$'s signature on this and it back fired terribly.

FINAL THOUGHT. There are some good moments but they're so few and far in between that a show is no longer worth watching if you sit through an episode hoping for that 30 second great scene. Without the Star Trek skin this would be a more tolerable scifi show but..as is, skip it.",26 January 2018
"Whether it's Star Trek or not is unimportant. Why? Because it's bad Sci-Fi and bad drama on a general level. The plot and development are near non-existent excuses for uninteresting and poorly rendered space clashes. The characters are flat as are the performances, though the actors are not to blame. The Klingons are stylized into an oblivion of glitter and gloss, which is possibly the worst thing one can do to a Klingon, as an established fictional character or as a hypothetical individual. It's camp, but without self-awareness, so it's trash. It's a budget space epic you buy on a sale on Stea, who's cutscenes have been re-enacted and made into a show, on youtube. There's one simple thing which illustrates all these points all too well - nearly all scenes are violently stuffed with superimposed lens flares which have no apparent origin or source within a scene.",26 September 2017
"I was planning to write a long and detailed review, but after logging in here I saw that many other reviewers have covered me fully.

I'll just say that this is not even mediocre science fiction, and the star trek series was always about making decent (if not excellent) science fiction in a way that is appealing to a wider audience. TOS and TNG specifically excelled in that, many scenarios were simply amazing, giving dramatic action through insightful puzzles. The dynamics of the casts were also amazing, becoming a major incentive for the series even from the first episodes.

There is minimal respect here for science or science fiction, the basic tenets of what star trek really is. We've come to expect certain things from a series carrying the name ""star trek"", none of which is delivered.",27 October 2017

"I agree with all the diehard Star Trek fans, this should have been called something else because very little reminds us of Star Trek. Now season 2 was an awesome ride for Trek fans. Season 1 was strange and confusing. Season 3 has been an absolute chore to get through. I also agree with many others, there is not character development. I'm almost done with season 3 and could only tell you a handful of characters names. The show opens up a lot of plot holes if this si supposed to be a short time before Kirk. Obviously non of the discovery's missions were memorable because there's no reference to any of them in the older series. Specially Spocks adopted sister. Were was she when he dies in Wrath of Khan? It's watchable but it's not memorable. You'll have to wade through their social justice sermons and apparently everyone in the future is gay. Put this in the J. J. Abrams universe and maybe it starts to make sense.",3 March 2022

This could have been so much more.",4 December 2020

"This is not Star Trek, it's an insult to Gene Roddenberry's vision. Star Trek is about learning life lessons through logical, scientific approach bereft of emotion. Each episode should be self-contained and explore subtitle aspects of interactions between members of the entire main crew. Discovery has been about one character, who cries her way through ridiculous plot holes of an unending soap opera-like storyline, and unrealistic character development.

All the negative reviews are right: nothing in this ""show"" seemed right. The characters are flat and cliché, the story is stupid, not even the ""bad guys"" are interesting. The dialogue ... there is simply no intellectual contents whatsoever. A lot of glares and senseless space battles, none of which helps build character. In the end I just couldn't care any less of all the characters. I wish all of them being sucked into a black hole so none of these crap would continue to ruin the franchise.",20 August 2018
There are unforgivable fundamental mistakes in this series the actor's good acting cannot override.,25 October 2020
"WHAT A BLUNDER! Terrible acting. Terrible plots. Overly glaring lense flares and graphics that try to make up for the lazy writing. I'm not a Trekkie, but I AM a big fan of science fiction in general. I've read it and watch it my whole life. This... this is a missed opportunity. A poorly cast show, ran my poor show runners, and written... well... poorly. I am truly disappointed by this garbage. I had such high hopes.

Sonequa is just terrible as a lead character. Michelle Yeoh has the most annoying voice I've ever heard, and can't act worth a penny. There is no real chemistry between any of the characters and nothing feels remotely believable it's so badly acted and scripted.

The only credit I can give this show, as that Anson Mount did a good job acting as Pike, from an acting stand point. But everyone else.. I can't think of one character that I like. They're all annoying in their own ways. Anson Mount should have been the main lead, and everyone else should have been fired, a new cast chosen that can actually act along side him.

We are witnessing the destruction of a once glorious franchise. I'm in the process of a Star Trek full watch. Started with TOS. Now I'm into season 4 of TNG. So good. But Discovery... doesn't even resemble them. OH wait, but it has a space ship!!! Not good enough.

NOW THE ORVILLE!!! THERE IS A TRUE STAR TREK SUCCESSOR. I'd like to take a second to PRAISE Seth MacFarlane for his brilliant show. Thanks Seth, for delivering to the true fan of science fiction, what science fiction deserves to be!

Additionally, The Expanse, is another example of a series that holds nothing back! Pure quality entertainment.

So why can't Star Trek Discovery get it right? Because they never watched Star Trek. You can't make a show based on a franchise you have never watched before. I've read interviews where actors/actresses and people involved had said they had never seen any star trek. I'm sorry, but if you're going to be involved in a MULTI Million dollar series... you might want to take at least a few hours, watch some star trek, read about it. It's called researching your role. How can you act believably when you've no idea what Star Trek is.

I am disgusted and offended by how terrible this series is, and CBS.",1 March 2019
"Watching STD completely detached from the original Star Trek and The Next Generation (in all honousty, I didn't watch the original till the end... a bit too old for me), one could say that it's a good show. Well produced, it looks good, it has a good pace and the episodes link together well with longer arches. The casting is good and it contains good action.

But...

If you see this show as a continuation of the original idea of Gene Roddenberry, than it's a complete miss and I agree with the negative reviews here on IMDb.

The science is gone, the exploring is gone, it has become way more violent (especially the Klingons) and the teamfeeling has turned into the Michael Burnham show. And at first I could live with that, but she gets annoying and as a viewer I can take so much ""almost crying to tears"" faces and ""agony and pain"" expressions. I can see why a show evolves around GBLT dynamics and I truly support that, but don't let it interfere with the science and logical energies of the original. And combine that with the overkill on emotions and soapopera themes in general and you kill a great show. It's too much in STD.

This is not how Gene Roddenberry intended his brainchild.",10 January 2021
"Besides space battles, future technology and the story, Star Trek's philosophy is the human story seeking advancement and perfection. STD completely misses this and becomes a Sci-Fi mambo-jambo built around a single character of Burnham.

"This show holds a 7.3 out of 10 rating but if you look at the actual ratings all I see it 3 stars and lower.

Horrible acting, SWEARING (not done if ANY other Star Trek episode/movie) and Klingons that look like... like... I don't know but defenitly not like Klingons.

. So I ask you this.

WHO is using his PC to bot this series with 10 star reviews because no true trekkie would ever give it more then 2 stars.

"It was marginally palatable the first two seasons but as usual, these wacko liberals that are running these show and movie productions ruin everything they touch. The PC level is ridiculous, off the chart and over dramatic. Season 3 is unbearable to watch. Women run everything, a black guy, gay guys, lesbians, subhuman creatures falling in love with vulcans. It's really a stupid show and I'm sorry to have wasted so much time watching it. The first two seasons were awesome. Very good writing. Now with the third and especially the fourth season, the writing is horrible. Everything is overly dramatic. Pretty much every cast member annoys me now. I'm guessing the show got new writers after the second season. If that's the case, then they should have end the show there. Where did all the creativity go???",5 July 2023

"All you need do to continue the legacy was add to it, within the clearly defined universe, to respect it and expand on it.

Total destruction of goodwill and trust.

The creators of this garbage are now operating under the misimpression that the fanbase they have insulted are now keen to see their next abuse of OUR trek by rewriting even more of it. CBS are now on every Trek fan's blacklist. That's quite an accomplishment.

Are they stupid?

We don't want you to rewrite yet more of the franchise, we want you to leave it the hell alone. You've done enough damage, enough insult, enough abuse. We don't want STD, we don't accept you rewriting it, and we sure as hell don't want you doing it again for another season. You screwed up, we all tried to tell you but you did it anyway. You're not wanted, you're not accepted, and you're so far from the line of winning over the fanbase that your actors careers are now going to suffer as a result.

There were some many entertaining possibilities for a new show, but they decided to allow people in the Hollywood liberal bubble infuse their ideology and came up with a concept this new drive system. One of the things that made Enterprise good (killed by long arch story lines) was the trail and error and emerging of ""tech"" we all knew and loved from previous shows being used for the first time. Discovery in the time line has all those tech things figured out and shows a confident well equipped Star Fleet. So the intrigue is gone. Not a problem because you have the war with the Kilgons....that could be really interesting, i show worth watching.

The plots for this and ""Picard"" have some ridiculous universe-ending threat every season, and gone are the joys of interesting aliens or character growth.

He increasingly relies on this method to produce publicity articles and videos that draw in fans of classic Trek.

When is Hollywood going to realize that you can't replace a lousy story with CGI? If that were true then we'd all just wait for the next Transformer movie. An artsy friend of my often repeats this phrase: ""If it doesn't work on the page then it will not work on the stage"". So let me ask the producers of ST:DIS (or the latest Star Wars offerings: ""did it ever work on the page?"". comment: has anyone wondered why programs like ""Breaking Bad"" or ""Better Call Saul"" get such high ratings?

"The series gave me a very bad impression when it started. Unfortunately it doesn't get better. Star Trek was always about the expression of a vision. How could this be someone's vision? Besides the fact that one should expect, as time goes by and scientific knowledge is better proliferated, a more meticulous approach to the scientific aspect, the series fails to appeal to anything good in us, very much unlike most of its predecessors that exemplified the best of humanity's ideals. There is some attempt to do so, by ""touching"" certain ethical considerations, but they are so limited and almost indifferently portrayed that they fail to shift the focus.

The writing is unimaginative, I think that perhaps the series suffers most from weak writing, weak ideas and their even worse application. It's a shame to have a legacy filled with scifi gems (in almost all its predecessors, at least the ones I've seen include TOS, TNG, Enterprise and Voyager) shifting its focus away from perhaps its strongest point. The acting isn't that bad, especially for some lead characters (Sonequa Martin-Green, Jason Isaacs and Doug Jones immediately come to mind).

"I didn't go into the details too much, and I admit, I did go over the top a bit with attacks against the current millennial culture of antifa and SJW, yes, I know that not all millennials support that stuff. But so did they with this show. The propaganda is so thick it's hard to watch the show. This is not Star Trek. This is what I wrote CBS.

Your version of Star Trek is horrible. Instead of being the one positive future in a sci fi world inundated with hopelessness your version of Star Tek is a miserable future full of war and people who are extremely unpleasant, undisciplined and chaotic. I began the first episode with all my friends as excited as could be, and from the very beginning it was questionable, soon to become unwatchable. Your show will go down as the first Star Trek where the participants will be boo'd at conventions, if they are even invited. Please, please, please stop now.

And don't think we missed all of the constant and over the top political B.S. I'm an atheist who is not racist, nor a homophobic however, I also don't buy into all the hatred towards our country or the Christian white male. A black woman with short hair named ""Michael"", two of the main officers not only gay, which is fine, but in a relationship together? So, not only do I have to deal with a relationship, but a gay one? Why would you think it's a good idea to make two of the main crew in a relationship? Something that has never been done before in any ST show. The only reason I could see is to push gay men in people's face, and I personally don't watch gay relationship t.v. shows or for that matter any relationship shows. The klingons are so over the top a sign of your dislike for Trump supporters, that it became impossible to see them as anything else but a propaganda attempt. Those are not Klingons, and your Star Trek people are NOT Federation representatives. A red head with learning disabilities, a coward alien with the ability to detect death (or better stated, the ability to tell millennials to get off their phones because a tense action moment is about to occur), two officers in a relationship (one of whom is just unimaginably annoyingly) a captain (the only ?straight? white male) who is obviously going to be shown as having a black soul and is evil (as are all white straight males to the people making this I'm sure). It's like a cast of misfits, I get it, the Star Trek where people get in just cuz, not because they have ability or deserve their positions due to merit. This show sucks, I hate it, and I will continue to bag it on every media forum, Facebook and anywhere else I can. It didn't get better, it continued to make no sense. A Frakking mutineer? That's the main character I""m supposed to be fond of? Someone who attacked a Klingon in space, killing him with no weapon other than his own (idiotic moment in the show) and is obviously there to placate idiot millennials who see antifa as heroes and not the useful idiot thugs they truly are. Attack first? Really? That's the officer I'm supposed to care about. Michael should die horribly for her crimes, she got her captain killed and is a chaotic mess. Your show sucks, please stop it now before the full force of the star trek fans begin some official protest against STD Star Trek Diversity. And tell Jason Isaac that his comments about destroying the star trek of Kirk and Picard, not Janeway and Sisko of course because they aren't straight white males, did not go unnoticed. I wont ever watch a movie that idiot is in again. How can you let someone bash the History of ST like that? You should have fired that guy immediately after he said that. But of course, the present millennial condition of lack of historical education leads them to attempt changing anything in the past that might seem like bullying or simply doesn't reflect who they are or rather, who they ""identify"" as. I would like an apology for this treatment CBS, and please know that until you can fix this horrible horrible mistake by putting out a new Star Trek I will boycott anything y'all do.

BTW, like so many of us, I would have paid for CBS all access just to watch STD (didn't anybody recognize that we use acronyms when referring to the different ST shows?)

MIRROR UNIVERSE? Don't care. Even if this does turn out to be in the Mirror Universe, I don't care. I really don't care. It sucks too bad to have Star Trek's name anywhere on this show. I don't want to watch one of the few positive future Sci Fi shows turned into a miserable, horrible dark future where everyone sucks at what they do and nobody can be relied upon.",13 November 2017
"Star Trek: Discovery always seems to be in a hurry to get to the next scene and/or part of the story when traditionally, Star Trek has been about enjoying the moment. This pacing is a fundamental problem, as the cast seems incomplete due to an lack of focus in character development, so you find yourself on a dark bridge with strangers. This gloominess is not only present in the art direction, but also in the lore, as it has ditched the classic Star Trek tropes of hope in favor of bleakness. Discovery also abandons the concept of bottle episodes in favor of season long arcs. This makes the show much harder to be re-watchable, like The Next Generation or Deep Space Nine. However, in the end it ultimately justifies its existence, although particular episodes on their own feel at times very lacking. If you are looking for a darker sci-fi show and aren't concerned with pacing or the Star Trek chronology, Discovery may be for you. Otherwise, you'll always have the classics or even The Orville for a smarter, more positive take.",25 January 2019

Season 4 was terrible. Why not bring back stories of the Star Trek Universe. Star Trek was about the characters and Honor in the world .

"Unprofessional is how I would describe this show. It started off okay with the first two seasons and I had it rated a 7/10, with the second season the best so far. But after watching season four, my rating has dropped to 4/10. They really need to cancel this show before it gets even worse.

I think the writers want to push the message that it doesn't matter who or what you are that you'll be accepted in this show. And that everyone has problems, and in this show we'll help you get through them. Also, if you are feeling awkward with your first sexual relationship this show is here to say it's okay to feel awkward. Now, if this doesn't sound like Star Trek and sounds more like some teen drama show, then you realize why I have lowered my rating to a 4/10.

The writers have lost it. I think they have decided that their audience is teenagers, and have decided to focus on issues that affect coming of age kids, and as a result this is no longer a mature show. None of these characters act like they are professional members of Starfleet. It's too bad that they have driven this show into the ground with the last two seasons.",27 February 2023

Second point, how could the bridge of the ship, that is supposed to be one or two decades before Capt. Kirk, be so much more advanced and high-tech. The other TV shows, some of which which were great and some of which that were awful, at least respected the continuity of the technology. I made it about halfway through this one and then gave up in sadness. Yes, I realize some of you will think the show is the greatest thing that ever was.

Worst star trek series of all. Has nothing to do with Star Trek except for the name.,11 January 2021
"Some people say you only hate it because it is not like the old Star Trek, but it is far easier to explain the hate towards it. I sit through two sessions of this, and it's just bad, badly written, a too thin plot stretched out over too many episodes, horrible dialogues, bad acting, characters that range from annoying to unlikable. Their attempt on humor is to let someone sneeze on another crew member, the series can be funny, but only when it doesn't try to be. Good writing is a rare sight in this show, cheesy dialogues the standard. For a show that is called discovery, they discover very little. Just watch the first scene of the first episode, the captain walks the Starfleet symbol in the sand of a planet to signal their ship! Which the person walking besides doesn't notice!

The whole budget seems to have gone into the special effects, the sets seem limited, a writter probably was never on board. So good effects? Kind of, but the space in this show never seems big or interesting to explore, and no one can tell me that the ship battles are better than in DS9 or even ST Wrath of Kahn just because the resolution is better. I really can't tell how someone can sit through this without constantly wanting to hit his head against the wall....",28 November 2021

"Sleek looking. 'Nuf with the compliments.

I only made it to episode five, in what presumably will be the very singular season one of this show, because I do have a sense of humour. It's laughable.

The writing regularly makes me toss and turn on the couch with cramps in the abs from laughing out loud in disbelief. The acting sees me bury my face in my hands from time to time, shaking uncontrollably while giggling like a little school girl.

I must admit, I only keep watching the show to find out what daft and crazy ideas they are coming up with next. They call it a ""story line"", I believe. Or, actually, I don't.

Although, this show is a must-watch if you are about 12-14 years old, and interested in so-called women who are called Michael, gay crew members, annoying & embarrassing young feminists, and a lot of actors who are generally looking into the camera like deer on a night road facing the headlights of a car.

UPDATE (after episode 6):

I wish I could still laugh about this disaster, but I simply cannot stand the sight of the dumb smug face (and silly hair style) of this Michael Burnham character any longer. That young ginger makes my toe nails curl, too. As does Captain Psycho, and his top science lunatic.

Where in the heavens do they find these actors? Did they offer to work for free in order to get on the show?

"I've found that this show is more enjoyable if you consider it non-canon, but not by much. Star Trek Discovery has very little in common with the tv series that precided it, which is a shame because they still hold up without the modern special effects. If you love the older shows your reaction will range from bitter dissappointment to seething anger. If this is your first Star Trek experience then I'm sure its an entertaining sci-fi show. That being said its as deep as a parking lot puddle so take my opinion with a grain of salt.

It is not all bad, but those few bright spots are few and far between. Every episode must culiminate in some deep emotional connection or realisation, it becomes exhausting and I am only halfway through the third season.

My main gripe with this television show can be put into one thought, and that is that whomever is in charge either never watched Star Trek, or never liked it in the first place. Most of the characters do not behave like Star Fleet officers, and the stories mostly consist of go here and do a thing, the only character I can say for sure that would fit in the Star Trek universe is Saru.

Poor story telling and very badly written characters, I'd say watch Next Generation, Data's poetry has more heart than this show.",2 January 2021
"I was a big fan of what Star Trek used to be all about... A complex utopian society that was a model for what humanity could possibly become.

In fact, I'm pretty sure there is no better model in pop culture.

Boldly blaha blah, Look, This is not that.

This is mired in sappy muck and filled with more plot holes than soft core porn. - but parts of it are fistingly fantastic. Thing is, those parts would probably be fantastic regardless.

I understand that this heavy interpersonal format is what the focus groups say draw the in the money demographic.

And herein lies the problem.

Star Trek was never about ""appealing to a money demographic"" and all the evils that come with that approach.

It was about expanding minds, equality and the wonders of science with a military-esq demeanour that made you Think as a kid- hey, this is how highly functional, extremely intelligent professionals conduct themselves in the future.

Well, that's gone.

Now I have to get my nostalgia by suffering through perfectly annunciated, tonally sensitive monologues seemingly inspired by white womens wall art.

"Not a hardcore fan, but aware about Star Trek in general.

In the ST that I've seen, the convention is to address officers by their rank like Ensign, Commander, Chief, Captain. No first names were used. The convention is ""Rank Last name"". Only the ship's medical officer would use first names on occasion. The medical officer may at times say ""Jim"" but all others would say ""Captain"".

For some reason, this convention is not followed in Discovery and ""Michael"" is the term used to refer to the First Officer. Aside from the lack of continuity with established ST protocol, surely in a large vessel using only the first name and no title would lead to confusion within the ranks?

"After giving up on the series six episodes in when it first aired, I decided to give it another try. I gave up again after finishing the first season.

The production value is insane for a Star Trek series and the visuals are stunning, together with pretty good acting. Discovery visually goes the road the latest Star Trek movies started. Lots of lense flares, blinking lights, close-up shots and shaky cams to make the experience ""realistic"" while in my opinion making it rather exhausting than fun.

Would I have watched it, if it weren't called Star Trek? I would have, being a fan of everything sci-fi after all. But I would have given up the first time instead of returning and giving it another chance.

Star Trek has built a lot of lore during the last decades. The writers for Discovery seem to just pick all the bits they liked from it and use it to their own content. Without the lore, the series would be hollow and have nothing original besides the spore-drive idea itself. The rest of it really are recycled ideas so far. Some plots get written to progress character development and make you feel closer to everyone you encounter in a series, build up tension and the whole world these characters live in.

Not in Discovery. The plots and twists are used to surprise you while completely ignoring character traits and dumbing certain individuals down for the sake of the twist. There is practically no character development in the whole first season and I didn't care about anyone personally.

The writers treat their own characters as idiots or completely opposite to what they were an episode before for the sake of a twist or cool idea with the plot. And ultimately treating the viewer an idiot for taking all that as granted.

I wont give it a third attempt. I've had enough and keep looking for actual entertainment. Star Trek lore aside, rating it as a random sci-fi series I still cannot give it a good rating. It felt like a chore watching the whole first season and the twists and turns made me cringe most of the time. Also... lense-flares. God I hate those.",11 March 2019
"Tons of people have already commented on the attempt to completely recreate (and thus upset) the Star Trek time-line, so I'm not even going to touch on that.

I'll limit myself to the actors, the visual style, and a brief comment on content: simply awful.

We're now three episodes in and not a single interesting and/or likable character has presented itself. Everyone, and I really mean everyone, is either boring, weird (and not in a good way), flat, a jackass (again, not in a good way), and/or simply badly portrayed. So far, I have no interest what happens to any of them. Sonequa Martin-Green: could be good but isn't. Jason Isaacs: boringest, most uninteresting and non-cerebral captain ever, zero charisma. Michelle Yeoh: close second to Isaacs, captain-wise. Doug Jones: laughable; at one point his character (who is First Officer, for Pete's sake) walks around the ship corridor eating blueberries out of a glass bowl -- are you kidding? Rekha Sharma: jackass; she didn't exactly perform well in BSG, and she's worse here. Mary Wiseman: goofy; you see her once and hope she'll die soon, be transferred away, or something. Anthony Rapp: simply bad at portraying whatever his character is supposed to be.

I could go on. How is it that each of the previous ST instalments had so many good actors and engaging characters, and this piece of junk has not even one? I don't expect anyone to be as fantastic as Patrick Stewart, but come on.

As for visual style, firstly, everything indoor seems like it was filmed in a cheap warehouse containing cheap mock-ups. Secondly, the CGI -- on which the series relies a lot (instead of providing actual content) -- is meh. Most sequences fail to be either realistic or awesome (in the literal sense of the term). Thirdly, what's with the darkness? Everything is kept in minimal light. It adds no mystery at all, it's just f-ing annoying. Frankly, it feels like the makers keep everything black because they are too lazy or incompetent to create something worth looking at. Well done.

Finally, a brief note re content: Episode three introduces breath scanners. Anyone -- so probably most who would watch this series to begin with -- familiar with Alien Resurrection (I call it 'the comedy episode') will just burst out laughing. Remember how the goofy General Perez character tries to breathe his way into a security section, over and over and over? Yep, STD uses that very same device. Good choice, guys, good choice.

If I'm supremely bored, I might check back in with STD (such a fitting acronym) in a few months. Frankly, though, there are so many excellent TV productions on air now that the likelihood is tiny.",2 October 2017
"It's a reboot, and you probably won't like it. Star Trek has built it's history and legacy on the exploration of science, humanity and our future place in the universe. It has used itself as a platform for that exploration, in cerebral social commentary, often placing topics of the day at the forefront of it's narrative, and usually expressed in less obvious and subtle presentations which resonate with our own internal struggles.

Star Trek Discovery is the next installation of the franchise after a 12 year gap, and boldly pushes forward by ignoring completely the history it's a part of. Where there was once intellectual stories and compelling morality plays, Discovery now presents only a dim reflection of it's foundations, with generic plots and uninspiring programming, the emphasis having moved to visual effects and bombastic action scenes.

While Star Trek Discovery has a tough job on it's hands by attempting to appeal to the existing fan base and trying to bring on board new viewers, it has categorically failed at the former in a spectacular crash landing.

There is a complete absence of any overriding themes other than ""don't fight with people"", and indeed those fans used to brain candy will find little remaining of Star Trek in this action series.

The visual effects are average for a presentation of this budget, one might be forgiven for thinking they are watching clips from the 2004 Battlestar Galactica reboot. One would assume that is due to the prominence of VFX which take up more time than the dialogue does.

This is a clear attempt at rebooting star trek yet again, and Star Trek Discovery will no doubt appeal to some young fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe tuning in for a special effects spectacular. However, as a part of the Star Trek universe this reboot completely misses the point of, and the heart and soul of trek, opting for action over intelligence in every scene.

"I really wanted to like this show but wow, just wow. It's as if the characters took lessons in how *not* to act. Highschool plays have more emotion. The main character has Vulcan roots and displays more emotional range than any other character. The rest of the crew talk like they're just trying to get their script done- and it's not some little thing either, it's seriously noticeable. At first I thought ""Oh they must be infected with spores or they're androids or something,"" but nope.

On top of that the show is fairly drawn out and includes a *lot* of subtitled Klingon dialogue. The Klingons, oh boy! I thought JJ ruined them by making them the faceless, reptilian looking killables in his movies, but they're just as bad in this. They've been redone, again and they look and sound *awful*. They didn't need it, fans loved them: They're Klingons for Kahless sake!

Sadly the Klingons are cannon fodder once more. Their best warriors struggling to beat any human character in melee. Their chosen guardians tripping on their Bat'Leths, fatally impaling themselves. Also their voices get annoying, it's like listening to a bunch of slow-talkers with cue balls in their mouths speak Latin.

Here's a crazy idea for the CBS execs - either do a REAL prequel to TOS (same costumes, props scenery etc, including the 60s colour scheme) or do a proper sequel (which we all want) set about 100 years from where Voyager left off.

"To boldly go where nobody has gone before! The line at the head of Star Trek for its first 50 years. This is no longer the case.

Being a prequel there was never a chance for the crew to go where nobody has gone before as the last 50 years of the franchise has visited the extent of that era. The solution? Jump the ship and the crew 950 years into the future.

This solution hasn't worked and what we get is a post-apocalyptic galaxy with a fallen Federation and criminal cartels. The Burn which is the Macguffin that facilitates the fall of the Federation is a plot device and nothing else. The writers quite clearly didn't decide what technology and the Federation looked like the day preceding The Burn and haven't really thought through what happened post-Burn. The writers chose the way they wanted the universe and inserted a Macguffin to facilitate this in a really lazy way. The lazy writing stretches across the season with half baked ideas and no real substance to what's being presented to us.

The decision of the show from the beginning of season one was to centre it around a singular character. This choice is now actively causing the show narrative problems as one character has ultimately become the centre of the universe. This choice makes the character incredibly unlikable to the pointed where the wonderful acting ability of Sonequa Martin-Green cant resolve this in the character.

The show is mired with over the top melodrama which is a narrative device designed to heighten emotional states to deliver very artificial emotional situations. This is a popular device in modern story telling but given the franchise history is does compromise the believability of the show. This means the characters just aren't that believable as they experience extreme situations.

Believability as mentioned before is a problem for the show as it does away with the use of established scientific ideas and theories in favour of more fantasy ideas in its universe and technology. In many cases the events on the show make leaps that are not based on science or a scientific idea (or even in universe development) to arrive at a state the writers want. Again we have more instances where the writing is lazy.

All of these issues come to a head in Unification 3 where the idea of a scientific debate descends into melodrama and isn't actually a scientific debate. The state of Vulcan (or Ni'Var) is presented in a state without showing how it got there and the idea of unification is only mentioned and not shown to be realised (if it hasn't been realised then why? This question should of been answered). Here the writers came up with a state they wanted and didn't feel they needed to explain themselves, then they inserted melodrama into the episode which orbits conveniently around a main character who is ""the only one that can help"".

The last point in this review is of originality. The show is very derivative as we have seen much of this before. Cartels lifted from Star Wars, fallen Federation from Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda and many slight rehashes of film and TV plots.

My conclusion and the feel I get is a very lazily put together season with no real thought put into it where they key is the cheap rewards that melodrama offers. This season is not hard science fiction which has been lost from the franchise and the crew can never truly go where nobody has gone before. The writers show a very lazy style in the techniques they use and the derivative nature of the season leaves you feeling like you have seen all of this before.",31 December 2020

At this point I'm fast forwarding through half the episodes just to get past the constant crying.

I'm exhausted. Sob stories need to be few and far between so they can feel impactful rather than like tedious episode padding. Which is exactly what this show feels like now, episode padding. Writers seem to have given up and are instead focusing on churning out formulaic episodes just to have content coming out.

I'm a life-long Star Trek fan and this is the first time I've been bored.

It's a generous 4 star only because it's still Star Trek, otherwise it woud be 2 stars.",20 December 2022
"So terribly disappointing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

There is nothing likable or interesting about any of the characters. Nothing interesting or likable about the story lines, if there are any. It is totally dark and boring. The Klingons are ridiculous. The young girl is totally annoying and obnoxious. Not one character has any charisma or any sense of likability. It is as disappointing as Trump for president. Well maybe not that horrible. But close. There is not one character that I like or care about. No room for humor. I don't want to watch a war movie with nothing but special effects. Star Trek had life lessons. This has nothing. Bummer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Scrap it, get decent writers, and start again next year.",19 October 2017
"Terrible writing , terrible over-acting that even Shatner would shun....Star Trek through the lens of people that don't understand Star Trek. ....lens flares, wtf Klingons, Star Wars holograms, spores, bad guy from The Patriot, and the most annoying lead ever",26 October 2018
"What is happening? Season three is absolutely dire, are they trying to kill the franchise, season one and two was absolutely fantastic but this is just totally horrible have they got new writers? Is it a Covid thing? What's going on? It's terrible everybody is crying the story is dreadful it had potential of being brilliant yet it's all messed up and I really don't care what happens at the end of the season I just hope whoever is writing this stops and get sacked because this is disgustingly bad. Star Trek was a bright shining light in television but this is truly truly abysmal",26 December 2020
"I feel like they don't have the budget for a fast-moving sci-fi, so they focus more on the drama and zooming in on people's faces for hours to avoid actually moving forward with the plot. A bit like The Walking Dead in that respect - they spend HOURS on people's faces rather than finding solutions to problems, and discovering cool new things which I'm interested in, to enhance my imagination and immerse myself in the experience; instead we experience dull humans with no personality talking to each other ad infinitum.

If I wanted to watch a drama, I'd watch a drama; don't ruin Star Trek - take a leaf from The Next Generation's Picard - he gets on with stuff without emotions getting in the way, with a few profound and meaningful quotes thrown in here and there.",26 December 2020
Come on. The first officer being so insubordinate and a goofy Captain. It sucked bad.over the top emotional displays...a heroish first officer? Id be more impressed if she shut up and followed orders. Couldn't even finish it. Over the top Klingon krap. I'm going back to TNG and Voyager,25 September 2017
"Well , I have put of watching this series as i love the original Star Treks . I was apprehensive and looks like I , amongst many others , was right. I am only on S1 Ep 4! I am so confused. If it's set before Spock Kirk etc , why is there much better technology!? I get that we have better cgi etc but it's not in keeping with a time line. I am confused as to why Micheal has gone from Mutineer to now a hero!? I find her character cold , rude and wooden. Also full of self importance and no smiles! Which is a shame as I love Sonequa in TWD. The Kilngons - dont even go there!? I never remembered them looking like or talking like that!? The only reason why 3 stars is because of the visuals really! I am not sure if I can continue to watch anymore. Its hurting my head trying to make sense of it all!",29 December 2019
"Really, the CGI is easily, EASILY, on the full sci-fi movie. Props are pretty good. Klingons look kinda weird, but again, it's overall good.

But the story and their adventures... Jesus Christ... Who wrote that garbage? This is just god awful.

Makes me wonder how in hell did someone said ""yeah, lets spend lots of money on top-notch CGI and animations and effects and props and use the worst plot we can find""

Beautiful Disaster.",18 January 2019
"I pretty much gave up around the 8 minute mark of the PILOT. The pacing felt off, the fact that Akiva Goldsman co-wrote and produced, The characters are not interesting, the main character gets her own ship right off the bat, even the fact that her name is MICHAEL.

I'm gonna say it. Even Galaxy Quest was more realistic and faithful than this.",24 January 2020

"I've tried to like it but this takes everything that was good.in the original and destroys it. The acting is really bad, everybody cries and whispers. Season 1 was decent, season 2 started going downhill and season 3 is just plain bad. The only thing that is good is the visual effects. The actress playing Michael Burnham makes this unwatchable for me",5 December 2020
"Completely lost caring for all characters in this season. Almost dreaded watching New episodes. Did not want my opinion to drop further...and yet it did...the rating I gave it was generous.

Maybe Stange New Worlds will reignite my hope!",20 February 2022
"I used to love everything in the Star Trek Universe. I've seen all the series, I own the RPGs and I've read many of the franchise's novels. But it seems like they are trying to ruin the franchise on purpose. The last movies have already been very bad (except for the third one maybe) but this is a new low. The thing that bothers me the most is the spore drive. Who came up with that idea? Genius ... NOT! Also, I somehow couldn't connect to any of the characters, they are all unlikeable and dull. Don't get me wrong, the cast itself is great. They are all great actors but the dialogues are cheesy, there is no trace of the humour present in TNG or DS9 and the characters stand for absolutely nothing. They are one-dimensional and most beginning writers would be able to do a better job. The plot goes here and there but ends up nowhere. There's no inspiration, no creativity, there's just bad writing. Also, a lot of people who critisize this series get instantly called homophobic or sexist but I'm definitely not. I welcome diversity in any way and I love strong women. I love to see black actors and actresses in lead roles. It's weird that I have to add this but I don't hate this series because of my political views, I simply hate it because it's really bad. It tries so hard to be edgy but fails so miserably in every way. It's simply boring and not Star Trek. I really don't understand it. There are a lot of accomplished writers in the Star Trek Universe and if you look at the DS9 reboot, ST: New Frontiers or ST Typhoon Pact there's proof that it's possible to tell good stories within the already established canon with well written characters. Why did they produce this horrible piece of crap? I hope it gets cancelled soon and we get a real Star Trek series. Hopefully without the involvement of Kurtzman (or Abrams). CBS/Paramount owe the fans of the franchise an apology.",17 February 2018
"The characters are boring, it is very difficult to feel any sympathy for them, they dont seem to gel together. The stories are improbable, with any sci fi you have to suspend disbelief, but this is just too much, I mean, come on, a starship powered by mushrooms, get real! But worst of all it has a blatant disregard for the canon of trek, it ignores so much established past trek history. In forty odd years Spock never mentioned he had a sister! And neither did his father! Its basically rubbish and any self respecting trek fan wouldnt waste time watching it. I watched the first season and part of the second then gave up, I didnt want to waste any more of my time. One star is way too much.",25 March 2019
"This is my first review and I'm not a life long trek fan.

Season 1 was great with jason Isaacs Season 2 was good too

Season 3 rubbish Season 4 absolutely rubbish The one star is for season 4

Main problem is the worst Star Trek captain ever created She was introduced as being Vulcan trained and yet is an emotional, impulsive annoying captain most the time Complete lack of internal plot logic As everyone says , way too many depressing speeches Very little tongue and cheek humor The science fiction part is entirely secondary to the soap opera

Picard on Amazon , the new captain Is a million times more funny and relatable to Burnham And the show fat more enjoyable, especially season 2

This show needs cancelling.",18 March 2022
"This series was never that good but I feel (especially since season 3) that it has gotten worse. Too much cringe conversations... the action is almost entirely gone at this point. Out of a 45 minute during episode 40 minutes is boring conversation, 4 minutes something somewhat interesting is happening and 1 minute action at most. It's called star trek 'DISCOVERY' but not a whole lot of discovering is going on at this point. The writers feel somewhat lost and the episodes are just being filled up with conversation instead of a plot.

Edit: Like others mention: Too much fake crying, the only thing that is 'discovered' in this Star Trek series are surface emotions. I'm guessing there are way too many women involved in the writing of this hot garbage. After watching episode 9 today I'm not coming back; horrible beyond imagination. If Netflix orders a 4th season that will be the 8th world wonder.",8 December 2020
"Why the slow burn, tortured and tedious over wrought emotional mind f$cking!? I really want to like this show... but I cant! It is an infuriating millennial dumpster fire of angst and meaningless and un-necessary emotional tension. Like a bad re-tread of 90210 in space in the 32nd century.

What kind of estrogen infused crap is this that every episode is full of un-necessary crying?

Omg! Lower Decks is 100x better than Discovery!",28 November 2020
"I found it both astonishingly stupid and frankly quite amusing. That's why I kept watching it until the end of season 1. I suspect that was not the producers were hoping for, though

I can clearly see that the ratings were not as good as expected and they made changes to the original story mid-course, which made it a soap opera ornamented with some sci-fi mumble jumble. Not that the original story was anything good but later twists to the plot was so incredibly stupid.

One important thing that has to be also said is that acting was terrible and that is one of the main factors that made it look so stupid (and amusing) as you clearly recognize people come together in a dark studio and fire their toy faser guns at each other.

It is sad, of course. But also inevitable when one tries to extract as much money from as possible from the same story.

I rated it 5 because it was indeed entertaining, after all.",2 February 2019
"What the hell is this about? I'm on S2 e6. I am trying so hard with this series. The writing is all over the place. Someone gets killed off, ""Oh dear, we need them back"" No problem they just come back to Life, simples. Maybe the writers all write in isolation so every episode has to be adapted to suit the episode's particular writer. Completely destroyed the franchise. I'm not trying anymore, pass me the delete series button.

I dont like the gloomy sets and Star Wars like action and the drama is so beneith rational professional human beings from Gene Roddenberry's future (and my hopeful vision of humans we aspire to be) it reminds me of a cheap soap opera. Star Trek Discovery is so superficially and badly written: in Star Trek everything is explained no loose ends, this show is full of them. Star Trek is hopeful this show isn't its negative gloomy ... and I don't want to be like anybody I see on screen... even my stephmom wants to be Picard! No this show has nothing Star Trek to me.",9 February 2020
"Best season is when Pike was on.

"I begun watching the original Star Trek as per a recommendation and thanks to its subtle, and visionary portrayal of Space travel and the future, I happened to really like it. Fast forward Star Trek: Discovery, and it has ruined the experience. The stone faced central character 'Michael' who seems to over-arch every other character unnecessarily is beyond tolerance. She could travel through a Worm-hole just by reading the ""logs"". The story line and dialogues which seem to make some sense in season one, lose it all in the second. The show is a big middle finger to science in its attempt to make it cool rather than reflecting how majestic science is.

To date (since 2010), I haven't left any series midway. My first!

Huge disappointment!",10 January 2021
"This is an insult to 50 years of Star Trek. Completely screwed up Klingons. The Federation seems much more advanced than in any previous Trek series, even though it is a prequel to all but Enterprise. The characters show no hint of any Federation values. Gene Roddenberry's optimistic view of the future is spit on at every turn. I did watch every episode of this garbage hoping it would somehow improve. It never did. It only got worse. For all of you that complain that you'll have to pay to watch this series, I offer you a very good solution: Don' bother. Kurtzman and Abrams should be banned from all things Trek. As far as I'm concerned, Star Trek ended with the final Next Generation movie.",15 October 2018
It seems to me that this show is in trouble from the start.Where is Jason Isaacs in first two episodes ? Why is female character named Michael? Why are the Klingons redesigned? Who wrote this? Have they seen any of the previous series?Why is Brannon Braga producing the Orville instead? The ship is a character in this franchise and the characters in each series are iconic and loved by millions of fans.The writers seemed to have missed the key elements needed to make this successful.Oh by the way the nerve pinch is like a mind meld and can only be done by a Vulcan so Michael must not be human or is he not a female or should he /she be called Michelle maybe lack of pointed ears is genetic defect I don't know I only hope this gets better or it won't last,1 October 2017
"Don't trust the ratings on this one. The Ghost Busters reboot had decent ratings when it first came out and for the same reason. They are all faked by the studio. This thing is a horrid turkey.

First, it can't be Star Trek because of the counter pissing contests going back and forth between CBS and Paramount. Basically, CBS hired Paramount to make it but wouldn't let them use any of the material from the original Star Trek. That's why it doesn't even vaguely look like Star Trek.

Second, it is without anything akin to any connection spiritually from the original plot wise. They completely trash the Prime Directive within moments.

Third, this thing is just one giant pile of all action. Not one thought was in it.

Fourth, not another JJ Abrams lens flare! I can't stand it.

Fifth, the acting was awful. Just stiff and amateurish as a board.

The best part was the CGI. Any time when the only thing you can say that is kind is that the CGI and special effects was good you need to watch something else.

This show was a betrayal of everything Star Trek and yet they try to give it a Star Trek name. I don't know how they could have the unmitigated gall to call this Star Trek.",6 October 2017
"It's not Star Trek by any stretch of the imagination. I'm watching the whole series as if it were a stand alone (non Star Trek) sci-fi show and it's ok at best. The characters are annoying and the writing is as generic as if J.K.Rowling and the writers of Days of our Lives put their heads together and had a go at a space series but some of the technical ideas are interesting with the spores etc however this is all ruined by the misguided ""Star Trek"" branding.",15 March 2018

"If there's one single thing this show does well, it proves that just because you own the rights to something doesn't mean you have the capacity to make it - or even understand it for that matter.

Star Trek isn't just a name. Like every long running piece of fiction, it has its own set of defining characteristics. For some reason the creators of Discovery have chosen to disregard every single one of them. The question is - why?

Perhaps they wanted to move with the times and innovate. That in itself wouldn't be a problem. But this innovation feels entirely ego-driven. Why turn Klingons into Orks, especially in a prequel scenario? Only for innovation's sake. Narratively there's nothing new here at all. They've just made the next generic big budget space war fiction with a popular brand name on it. All right, perhaps they wanted to create an action packed space opera for the masses. But they could have done so in an original universe of their own, seeing how the defining characteristics of Star Trek don't really fit their purpose. Even a spin-off would have been better that this. So that leaves us with two logical explanations.

One - it's just naked profiteering. Star Trek is widely popular, therefore the big investment. Cynical, but likely true. And two - they just don't understand what Star Trek is about, nor do they care.

And that's not even the worst part. The worst part is that these people have nothing to say. There's no message here, only the same regurgitated social agenda that you can read anywhere on the internet at any given time. No matter where you stand on current issues, there's no interesting perspective here for anybody. Gone are the original ideas, outlandish plots, smart dialogue and philosophical conundrums that made Star Trek what it was. Now it's just self-righteous people shouting at each other and things exploding in space.

As if to compensate, the show is massively overproduced. There are copious amounts of lens flare, bloom, dutch angles, shaky-swirly cameras and unnecessary editing. It looks like the frame never stays in the same place for a even second. Watching an episode of Discovery feels like stepping into a tumble dryer. Things keep swirling all over the place even when there's no action on screen. I strongly suspect that if this wasn't called Star Trek, it would have no hope to succeed.

Normally I don't give 1 and 10 star ratings. Those should be reserved for the most unlikely sitations. I gave it a good thought, but couldn't find any single redeemable quality that this show has. Don't touch this with a ten foot pole.",10 May 2018
"I'm sure the writers have never ever watched even a single episode of Star Trek The Next Generation (what I consider the golden standard of sci-fi) or Voyager (the second best). I'm also sure they got confused with another series. Star Wars. Just because they both start with the word ""Star"" doesn't make them the same. This Discovery is Star Wars, not Star Trek. It focuses on battles and actions and stuff. Star Trek is all about exploration, possibilities, widening our imagination. And what was the criterion for casting these actors? They are all annoying. Were they deliberately looking for annoying characters? This is not Star Trek and whoever is behind this should be ashamed. Please rename it to something else or end it entirely.",14 December 2020
"I watched the first couple of episodes, and I honestly hated it.

Star Trek isn't a great work of art or story telling. It is cheesy, campy, and takes itself way too seriously. That said, I have a secret soft spot for star trek.

This show actually makes Star Trek: Enterprise look good, and that is painful to admit. Enterprise was a terrible, terrible, terrible disaster. There I got what little fanboy I have for star trek out of the way. I watch a lot of star trek, its one of my go to's for binge watching.

The ONLY thing this show has in common with the rest is that it takes itself way too seriously. That is it.

This show doesn't have any of the depth or intelligence of the original, much less Generations, Voyager, or DS9.

It is visually 'pretty' if that is your thing, and there are some good action sequences, if that is your thing. In other words its perfectly sexist about its demographic targeting. Make it pretty, and make it violent. All audiences will love it.

Except anyone who has ever watched ToS.",29 December 2020
"Everything is urgent yet so much time for dozens of conversations of love, friendship, what you meant to me, etc etc. Endless CGI battle scenes. Too much diversion and splash. Seconds to live but time for more repetitive talk.

Not enough focus despite some very good plot that does all come together, well enough. If only we could be spared the endless extra hours of melodrama.

I really liked season ONE. A lot of elements. Season TWO started ok, but turned to a bizarre mess.

Not sure if I'll do season three.",27 February 2021
"I like it overall but the Michael burnham character. The show wants to make a female as the main character but then fails to name the character a feminine name (what is Michael?? A man name) , fails to portray a female character (she is portraying a man not a woman, with her hair, her walking, her talking, everything is wrong with this character). The show puts so much on this Michael burnham character, portrays as if Michael burnham is the messiah and whatever she says needs to happen, as if all the other characters are redundant. Definitely it would have been nicer to have a ""real female looking"" hero instead of this actress. Also the way she talks is super annoying and repelling. I like the other characters a lot. That's why I watch to see the other characters actually. I wish writers put more time on other characters instead of Michael burnham and her know-it-all style.",6 April 2019
Star Trek in name only this series wants to capture the Star Wars fans. If you're looking for all action and sci visuals this will version of Star Trek will do. If you want the altruism and hope of the original you won't find it here,6 December 2020
"Revised from 3* to 2*. ST Discovery is only watchable as some kind of a hillaric persiflage of all real ST series. When will Michael starts to cry this episode? Do we have to wait a full excruciating 30 minutes this episode, or only 4? And how ridiculous is this squirming emo crew kiss and make up to each other this time? But I keep watching, maybe because of my vain hope some Romulan warbird decloaks and blows Discovery to smithereens. That would be a great ending of this abhorrent series, and an act of mercy for all fans, and even the whole Star Trek Universe itself.",29 November 2020
"It just wasn't very good, another Ghostbusters (2016) equivalent.

The stand-alone story archetype for each episode always worked better for me, I can tell this is going to be more middle of the road garbage, either here nor there, you know what I mean.

I'm a fan of Voyager, TNG, DS9 was good but not great, I even liked Enterprise, for the most part, though, like DS9 it went a bit sketchy towards the end.

I never got round to watching the original series, although I did love the pilot episode.

IMDb just isn't a reliable source for ratings anymore, no one in their right mind would give this show 10/10, yet over 30% of people are giving it 10/10, fake accounts to boost their ratings, sad but true.",25 September 2017

"The show started off pretty decently I think. I've heard cries about ""woke BS"", but I didn't pay much attention to it. It is ofc questionable when you take Star Trek and say: ""gotta make this sh** inclusive"", for reasons I don't have to explain to anyone who watched the other Star Trek shows. I'm just rewatching TNG and if you look at the main characters - Picard, Ryker, Yar, Troy, Worf, LaForge and say: ""Gotta lose the 2 white males and we are good to go"", you are no longer going for ""diverse"" you are going for ""discriminatory"", except you know discriminating against white males doesn't count xD. I focused on the story of the show though and didn't let this bother me much.

Given that, I liked the show at first, first season was very good imo. I liked the fresh approach to Klingons, their new appearance and the fact they actually spoke klingon a lot. I liked the plot twists and I liked most of the characters. My favorite character was prolly Stamets, brilliant, direct, snarky, definitely had a lot of personality. For some reason though, I liked the show less and less through the seasons and I wasn't quite sure why.

Now as I'm rewatching TNG it finally strike me ... it just doesn't feel like Star Trek anymore, like ... at all. The problem isn't that everyone on the show is either person of color, female, LGBT or a combination as some bigoted comments would suggest, the problem is they behave like characters in MTV teen drama xD. Everybody is mushy and emotional all the goddamn time, while the typical Star Trek crews were stern professionals most of the time, as they should be. Given that, the show doesn't just fail as Star Trek series, it fails it's political message as well. If you intend to fight the stereotypes, then ... fight them please. Stop feeding them by showing bunch of female and LGBT characters in constant emotional turmoil, which makes them come across as unprofessional mess.

Given that I'm giving the show 4/10 as of now, even though I think it started as very solid 7/10 if not 8/10. And no, it wasn't because there were straight white males in season 1, I sincerely dislike Lorca xD.",29 March 2022

Think of star trek discovery as a low budget soap opera, but in space. It's definitely not to the level of any of the old star trek series, but it's not as bad as it's initials suggest: STD.

This is utter boring trash TV!

The only positive thing I can come up with is the special effects but, good looking special effects does little to improve things if there is a boring cast, boring story lines and a TV series that practically goes out of the way to bore the heck out of you.

The name 'Star Trek' implies that it's a trek, to and from the stars... An interesting name that can lead to interesting stories but instead the creators killed this series with stupidity. Nothing about this series is interesting... It's loaded with boring nonsense that will make the most ardent star trek fan fall asleep in an instant.",12 January 2018
"Like many Star Trek fans, I awaited the rebirth of Star Trek TV with much anticipation. The fact that it was to be set pre-TOS was a bit disappointing. I had hoped this new series would be set a few hundred year beyond Voyager. Nonetheless, I still had high hopes for the series.

Sadly, those hopes were soon smashed. I found it to be a confusing MESS. None of the characters are likeable. Swearing? Give me a break. Rap music? I feel sick. A secondary character that acts like a faithful puppy needing praise? Mindless.

After watching several episodes it became unbearable.

""Star Trek: Discovery"" should be spurned by true fans and casual Trek fans alike. If this happened and ""Discovery"" was cancelled, then perhaps a re-think would occur and eventually a new series faithful to, and reflecting the true nature of ""Star Trek"", would be created.

The fact that ""Discovery"" is going to a 2nd season is just proof that sci-fi fans are desperate for new ""set in space"" series.

Thankfully there is another sci-fi TV series ""set in space"" that's worth watching. That series is ""The Orville"".",13 June 2018

I was looking forward to the new series, but I had no idea that it was not going to be shown on network TV after the first episode. I only found out that it would be subscription only after I had watched the premier. There is nothing else I would watch on the pay service, so there is no consideration of signing up. Even if I would consider it, the quality of the show was disappointing.

If your show is named ""Star Trek..."" you have a reputation to live up to, they did not. Neither the acting or the plot lived up to my expectations. I'm sure Trekies will sign up for their service because of this show, but I doubt many others will. This seems like a really bad marketing idea to me.",30 September 2017
"This review is based on the first two episodes of the first season.

Star Trek Discovery is very dark with a continuous story that takes itself very seriously. It has the same tone as the Star Trek movies of J.J. Abrams. It becomes very early abundantly clear that this series will be about war and all the dark aspects that come with it.

The effects were splendid, but I couldn't really get into the show. It didn't feel like Star Trek: there was no glimmer of hope, no exploring of new ideas, just the start of a conflict that is referred to in other Star Trek series.

If you like a dark story with some nice effects, with explosions, war and death, which is serious and does take itself serious, you might like this. But forget about the 'Star Trek' label: this is mainly war in space, not true science fiction that explores new ideas like the first few series.",22 October 2017
"This show is the worst. I went through the whole of season 1 in order to properly criticize this since i had little hope based on all the negative reviews, and they are right. The show is stupid soap opera in space with absolutely 0 Star Trek in it. The premise is dumb, the technology is more advanced than the original show, ludicrous, and all hope of a good future is gone. Everyone gets a waterworks episode, and the whole character of michael burnham is ridiculous.

Someone call the Roddenberry estate and tell them to take away this rights from Paramount. A total disgrace of a show. Kurtzman should be taken away from anything related to Star Trek, he's the Kathleen Kennedy of this franchise. The SJ agenda on this is more than evident, and they use ST to further their platform.

"Im a crazy sci sci fan. I tried to keep watching this show hoping in vain that the next episode may be a good episode with a good sci fi story..

It's just that the character of Gray Tal made me review this series in the worst... He does nothing, speaks in an extremely weird way, seems like an 80 year old for being so young and he brings down also the series potential of Adira as well... I hope they remove his character, I can't even look at the screen when he is there...

"I love Star Trek since I can remember. Every year I watch more than 10 seasons, and I enjoy every chapter as the first time.

I barely can describe the emotion I had when finally new Star Trek content was going to be produced. Right now, I would prefer gouge out my eyes with a drill before watch a new chapter.

It is not Star Trek, it's Grey's Anatomy in bright starship, but with a rubbishy script. If I watch Michael crying again I am going to puke. I have to let Discovery go. It too much painful. I never be able to forget this insult. Never.",22 December 2020
"Discovery peaked in the second season and that was because Pike was in it, in some effort to tether Discovery to the Enterprise and the wider Star Trek universe.

I've watched each episode of Discovery and season 3 is a show in the final desperate breaths of life, but refusing to die.

The problems begun before Discovery ever aired, mainly because it would focus on one person and not the ship and its crew. Many were correct in seeing the red flags, but the writers and execs continued in some attempt to prove the doubters wrong. Each episode and story arc goes like this: the ship and crew face a problem, Burnham saw it coming and knows whatever choice the crew makes, it will be wrong, and she will be right. The crew at that point go through the motions, become extra and work out a resolution mostly off screen. The crew voice their resolution and Burnham, knowing they are wrong will default to her own self important morality that supersedes the crew to go on her own secret / rogue mission. Conclusion, crew wrong (even if they were right, they are wrong) Michael Burnham saves the day, usually with a lip tremble, deep emotional speech and / or cries. If Michael is partially wrong (she never is totally wrong), then the same lip tremble, deep emotional speech and / or crying. Repeat for season 1, 2, 3, 4................ episodes 1, 2, 3, 4........

Burnham is emotional and deeply flawed, self-important and selfish. She shows no signs of Star Trek characterisation of learning and growing and she is stuck in this perpetual loop of her own importance that make the storylines entirely predictable and unsurprising; remember Burnham is always right. I would not trust her with a house plant.

A brilliant supporting cast are seriously let down by poor stories and writing, the glimmers of brilliance in Doug Jones as Saru and Michelle Yeoh as Georgiou is not enough to save this show from catastrophic cardiac arrest. They should just get rid of the cast, because they are holding Michael Burnham back, but the writers need them there to be wrong all the time.

CBS and the writers must know that they created a rod for their own back by focussing on one person but using a star ship as the backdrop and in their never ending quest of making the Burnham centric story work which make the storylines and arcs utterly predictable with the same conclusion of Burnham with lip tremble, deep emotional speech and / or crying.

Comparing Discovery to Picard is a common argument of the 'good' discovery reviews. The difference is that Picard is focussed on one person, not hiding from that while giving enough back story, substance and arcs to other characters that Discovery basically fails to do with their show but seem to be trying to fix these niggles while making it much worse.

If Discovery wanted to focus on Michael Burnham, then they should have called it Star Trek: Burnham. To attempt to fool the viewers into thinking it is about a whole ship and it's crew by using the name of Discovery in the title is false marketing. The ship that is Discovery hasn't discovered much of anything that is significant and it's supposed to be a ship of discovery and science, to explore strange new worlds. To seek out new life and new civilizations. If you want any of that, Discovery won't provide it. The crew haven't discovered much either, other than they go through the motions as a plot device to learn that they were wrong all along and unsurprisingly Burnham was right. Must be the most underused ship in the history of Starfleet.

Plenty reviewers think Discovery is being woke and I understand why they see that as a divergence from Star Trek. Star Trek is a show that realises our differences, whether that be those from a different planet, gender, sexuality, colour, race, language, and an understanding that these were part of a normal day and were normal. It seems now, that the writers of Discovery feel that they need to manipulate that very fabric for political and woke points. The cynical part of me says that they deliberately are choosing to manipulate it because they need to attract viewers and appealing to those very people who insist that differences should be highlighted, which flies in the face of the original idea of Star Trek.

The reality is this is nowhere near Star Trek, this is so far removed from the ideals of Starfleet that Roddenberry had. Season 1 should have been an indicator of the troubles that were coming because it trampled all over the canon and the idea was to move it so far into the future that it didn't affect the canon, but during that transition to attempt a true Star Trek show they got anything but. I'm of the opinion CBS bought the Star Trek brand, pinned some other story it had and put it in space.

The Star Trek universe is alien to Discovery, and it shows. As much as it tries; Discovery will never enter a true Star Trek universe. I wonder if Season 3 was deliberately sent so far into the future by the Discovery writers, that they know writers of Picard, Strange New Worlds and any new Star Trek series can alter the timeline to isolate the Discovery story to its own separate and individual timeline and removing Discovery and the awful show it is from the true Star Trek universe and timeline.

The writers need to seriously consider initiating the self-destruct sequence on the ship and make efforts to forget it was ever trying to be part of Star Trek.

"Sadly I have now watched all three episodes of this travesty of a show, I can not for life of me understand why you would want to create something like this in first place! This series is attempting to tell a story involving a character, who is from the original Star Trek, without any backstory or logical reason him being on this show or in this case on enemy prison ship. This a very flimsy & clumsy story line in first place with this show trying of stitch a hole in space-time continuum by creating a vortex between both series, however the actor who played this named character did capture his some of his essence, by doing a disservice to both Original and this awful show! I will check back later with this prequel but for now, I think I am done for while with this show!",16 October 2017
"Boring. I'll rather watch Voyager all over again. 20 years ago some things were still right.

NOT a single CHARACTER was found.They all seem dead inside. The redhead might as well be from Grey's Anatomy. I love GA, this was not suppose to be GA.

It's just isn't a good show, not to mention that they used the known title, without knowing what to do with it.

If you want to do things your way (oh so very original), at least don't steal the name of something that was already done and done well! You will fail(as 7of9 would say). As many other did, lately.

"Only made it through about ten minutes of the pilot episode.

It's supposed to take place ten years before TOS, but there's nothing TOS about it - not the ships, not the uniforms, not the Klingons, not the technology, not the crew behavior . . . nothing. It's as if CBS just bought an already-written generic sci-fi show and added Star Trek terminology.

"This is just... I don't know what it is. It's grim, dark, joyless. It's a horror show, it's a gritty drama of some kind, it's a CGI and effects showcase perhaps. It's definitely a lens flare extravaganza. None of the characters even seem to like each other very much, much less become a family that you can invest in on any level.

It's honestly distressing to think that this is supposed to be Trek. Why is the Captain developing a forbidden technology? Did they just steal the Blink drive from Dark Matter or what? How does the the pre- TOS era have such advanced technology? Why is Michael's backstory so contradictory??

Starfleet personnel normally represent the height of ethics and dignity. The studio here seems to be saying, just shut up and have a cookie. WTF???

"As a generic sci-fi show it would be ok and I think a lot of the 1-3 star reviews would be higher. Although episodes 10-12 create an promising story arc, I don't count this as Star Trek (yet). It's more like GoT in space where the good guys loose and the bad ones survive. This might be more realistic in the end but I have enough of this crap in the real world right now. Star Trek to me depicts a positive picture of the future.. a light tower, something to strafe for.

Things I like about the show:
The story twists in the alter universe seem promising and explain some bad behaviour of some characters
The bridge design of the USS Shenzhou is/was awesome


Things I dislike:",29 January 2018
"You call this Star Trek more like Star Soap with all the social engineering that the producers are attempting. Unfortunately Hollywood and the Networks always manage to:

A) Cancel good productions B) Let unwatchable garbage continue forever until the cast members are even sick of doing the show.

The Original Star Trek at the beginning was canceled due to the social norms were restrictive to the concepts of women in space let alone being in positions of authority. The interracial aspects the 60's were full of racial segregation and to see a black women on a space ship was hard to take. What saved Star Trek came after the show was canceled. The Apollo Space Missions to the Moon. This event not only caused a resurgence among the general public appetite for anything space oriented. Even the auto industry's line of cars that model new cars with anything looking space age. Star Trek had a simple plot taken from an existing genre where they got more than half the Star Trek cast from, they were westerns. They followed a simple logical story line that exist even today. The Good guys and the Bad Guys. People love to watch good guys win. They don't like to mess it up with complicated social issues that appear polarized with the public. Doing so tends to kill off interest and viewership in any production. Also the scripts writing was kept simple. Where as if you see any production today they replace action with more words or Talk till you blue in the face. Discovery cannot survive as a production by trying to impress with just Special effects because viewers are more loyal to the story line that most Hollywood producers think. I watched the first 6 episodes but stopped it was boring and way over the top on jamming social issues that should have nothing to do with Star Trek. BTW I found I didn't like the new Klingon's makeup. I'm hoping eventually loyal fans and producers of the original series will wait till this abomination is canceled and they fix it. Until then I'm done with Star Trek I can always watch reruns.



I was hoping they would cancel this abomination...",15 August 2018

"This show is ludicrous. Made by people who never cared to watch previous iterations of Star Trek. The continuity problems are so many it baffles anyone who ever watched any other Star Trek. Add to that the new stupid ideas they came up with and you end up with ""Discovery"". Seriously, the show revolves around the insane notion that the quantum universe has a gigantic mushroom network that can be used for instantly travelling anywhere in the universe. What the hell is that? Who thought that was a good idea? That's worse than anything Disney could pull out of thin air with Star Wars!

The retcons are everywhere. If the mushroom highway was a thing, Voyager would never be stranded in the delta quadrant. Spock had a brother, Sibok, and if Spock had a foster sister, he would probably have mentioned it before. No one remembers Sibok for some reason. They use 3D holographic transmissions that are considered new technology in Deep Space Nine, but now they are old news. The Klingons suddenly have ridges in their foreheads even though Enterprise explained how they were infected by a virus that caused a mutation. The Klingons are now obsessed with the dead, even though in the Next Generation they don't care. Travel above warp 9.9 has always been a no-no in Star Trek, and the subject has been approached, literally, in all Star Trek shows, no exception; but now ""Discovery"" rewrites the rules, because with this show, there is no canon. With this show, anything goes.

Finally, there is the matter of virtue signalling and political correctness. Star Trek was always envisioned as a future where humanity thrived and overcame these issues. Kirk says that where he comes from, people don't care about gender, size or appearance. Uhura says that she cannot be offended by old prejudices she knows have no foundation in reality. Picard is an advocate for androids and Janeway for holograms. Then out of the blue, the producers of ""Discovery"" come and say that Burnham is the first character to represent women in Star Trek. That she is representing the black community. Then when people point out how shallow and poor is the character, they are accused of prejudice. This is insanity. We had black characters in all Star Trek shows, including captain Sisko. We had strong women in all shows as well, including captain Janeway. Now the ""Discovery"" mob in their arrogance come to try and preach tolerance to the Star Trek community. Are they insane or just obsessed with virtue-signalling? Burnham is a bad character because she is a bad character, in a badly done show. There's no relationship whatsoever with intolerance.

Well, this is a lack of respect and I seriously think this behaviour is destroying the brand. Because ""Discovery"" is doing that: transforming Star Trek in just another brand. They are ""Disneyfying"" Star Trek. Sad days.",15 April 2020
This series is a betrayal of the dream of Gene Roddenberry. It is unbelievably violent. No exploration. No sense of camaraderie. Also the acting is bad and the special effects are bad.

"I am not a big Star Trek fan. Everything I know about the Star Trek world comes from the new movies, I have not watched the original series and I don't plan to, because the low production value just puts me off. But even I can tell that this is as far from Star Trek as you can get - and the worst thing about it is the main character. I hate that Michael person (the name just makes me cringe, too), she's so unlikeable it's baffling. Arrogant, stupid, intellectually inconsistent (I mean, in the first episode she was the first one who suggested that the damage of the satellite relay was just a trap for the Federation ship that comes to investigate - and then when they found a vessel nearby, hiding from their sensors and somebody suggested that they're probably hostile, she throws a hissy fit. I can't be the only one who found that just dumb.) She's clearly emotionally unstable and unfit for the position of First Officer. I mean, she is UNABLE to listen. She just does everything her way and messes things up because she's not capable of comprehending the notion that other people could be right and she could be wrong. Just seeing her on the screen made me want to claw my eyes out - and all those scenes with her and the captain made me want to barf. The two of them cared more about emotionally supporting each other more than about commanding the ship. The USS What'sitsname should've imploded years ago, with these two idiots in command. Not to mention the fact that Michael McStupid killed a Klingon (on a Klingon vessel) and nobody seemed to give a what. One could argue that the reason the war started was because the First officer of a Starfleet vessel saw it fit to just knife a Klingon in the chest. The show is dumb, dumb, stupid and dumb.",5 October 2017

This series makes the new Chris Pine Star Trek movies look good.

I can't relate to any of the 'good' guys and I find myself relating to the Klingons the most. The ultra progressiveness seems to hurt this series a lot, but some things also look off. Klingons look far too different from how the species has be portraited in all other material.

"I don't get why it's called Star Trek, it carries nothing of the legacy. STD is to Star Trek as an xbox is to chess. Star Trek has never been action oriented and dumbed-down to this level except in the stupid reboot movies. Is that what they are trying to copy?

They keep name dropping, throwing in lots of things from previous star trek series, but it doesn't fit because it has nothing whatsoever to do with Star Trek. It feels like a parody made for teenagers.

In no reality is this Star Trek, and I am not accepting it as Star Trek. As far as I'm concerned Star Trek died in 2009. This is nothing more than an action series for kids who have seen the reboot movies and think that is what Star Trek is all about.

The characters were so basic and desperately pushing a PC agenda that none of the more than diverse previous Star Trek shows and movies had. Star Trek has always been very diverse from the start, but never before has it been forced down your throat the way it is now. And the Klingons ... the coolest race by far, have been completely ruined. The look, the language... rubbish. Watching this reminds me to back the Axanar fan film project.

There are some unbearable characters in this show with such serious mental issues that they would never pass the psychological testing in a real military like setting. Besides that, the chemistry between these characters is broken and hollow. What's good about this show? Special effects and set design are very good but the external design of the ship is a kludge. It's like they're flying around in the amc gremlin of space. I watched the first 2 seasons hoping that they would find their footing. Even TNG and DS9 had a slow burn until they clicked. This show just....it's like fat free salad dressing. You know it sucks.",22 September 2021
"There have been nomerous Star Trek series and motion pictures but not once did they revolve around the emotions (or more like the emotional breakdowns) of one single character. Star Trek: Discovery should be called Star Trek: Michael Burnham. It's as if she was the center of the whole univers. It's comlpetely ridiculus, in every episode the story/challenge they face is just secondary and the focus is always on Michael Burnham struggling with her emotions and crying in the end (or in the middle or every time for no reason at all).

I tought that it can't get worse after Season 2 but it took only 8 minutes (and this is including the time of the recap) for Michael to cry in the first episode of Season 3

If you played a game where you have to drink every time Michael gets emotional you'd be drunk after every episode but maybe that would make it watchable.

Season 1 introduced an awesome captain character and Michael Burnham was just a small disturbance, season 3 is just focused on Burnham drama and more drama.... I don't know who is calling the shots for this show but they need to be removed.

What a waste of the efforts of the people that helped build this....",8 January 2021
"I am a long time hard core sci-fi fan. I watch absolutely everything sci-fi related. New and old. The first two seasons were spectacular, it even made me willing to accept the clearly non-Klingon Klingons. (Seriously, that species evolved from a fearsome predatory animal, at no point in their history did they wear intricate clothing and jewelry.) But this...this... I had to force myself to watch season 4. It is just impossible to enjoy the good sci-fi parts when they are hidden behind an abundance of bad soap level writing. No wonder the actors couldn't make this work. (And not just the writing was bad, everything but the cgi was so much worse compared to before.) Really, was no-one involved willing to stop this from happening? Was everyone to busy being nice and non confrontational? Because that is the only explanation I can come up with. Apparently the writers have forgotten we are in a story about a military organization that is exploring the galaxy with a heavily trained and disciplined crew. The best of the best. No leader would stand for this amount of unprofessional and dysfunctional behavior. And for the love of Q, one personal story arc per episode is enough! One per season would be enough! The writers have forgotten their responsibility to fit in the vast history and storytelling world of the Star Trek universe. They have been given een honor and this is what they have done with it. Gene Roddenberry must be spinning in his grave.",25 April 2022
"I watched TOS as a pre-teen and was hooked on Star Trek for life. I have watched every series, every film many times and was really looking forward to Discovery. I will not say it isn't good, I just can't say it's fantastic, as I'd hoped to. I watch each episode with hope of being wowed, and it always misses. I have to admit I can't name one character who has made such an impression I would be sad to see them go, or be interested at all in what happens to them. The Klingons are all wrong, since when do they care about bling. I know it's the future but did humour die in 2200 or why are all the players so boring. Even the comic relieve is just awkward not funny. As mentioned I've been watching TV for along time and it is not easy to impress me, so I was hoping to be impressed with Discovery. I'll keep hoping until it gets too boring.

Discused the time line with my son while watching and we just couldn't figure out whether it's a completely new one or not, and if not where does it fit in with the rest of ST.

Might write an update later, positive or negative, we'll see.",10 October 2017
"Bad script, bas characters and a huge load of SJWs themes withoout any connections to the plot. The directing is confusing, the canon is totally disrespected.

"I don't know what the hell this is. I watched all of the Star Treks, but this is the first one that looks like Tokenism on steroids. There's nothing but obvious forced inclusion & representation. They didn't care about actual acting talent, just cast people based on their race, not talent. Previous Star Trek's didn't have this forcing of SJW content in it, just for the sake of it being there. The writing is horrible. They're more concerned with this show being a conduit for progressive concepts rather than just being thought provoking sci-fi meant for escape. Instead of escape, you're just reminded of all the modern SJW crap you see on the news. It's like a sociology graduate from UC Berkeley or UOT just shoved all the crap the SJW crap he learned at school into this show.

I tried. I really tried, but this is not Star Trek. I have no idea what the hell this is. It think this was made for people who are not fans of Star Trek, but people who just graduated from a hardcore leftist college.

Some dude will probably rea this and think I'm racist. Nope. Captain Sisko is my favorite Captain of all the star-ship Captains, he was a brilliant actor.

Thanks a lot all you SJW's for ruining Star Wars and now Star Trek. You really suck. *sigh*",14 August 2018

"Anyone having played the ME series must get a strong vibe from the uniforms, to ship interior with the typical stairs and even overall technology. I mean, interactive holograms before TOS?? Aside from the political agenda and the producer/creators hyping it up to no ends, this really is a middle finger to the Trek Universe. With some competent writers, this would make a fantastic ME series. I'm not sure i should be mad or disappointed for the fact that a ME-LA series would essentially look like STD. BTw, STD abbreviation? Really. Did nobody notice that before hand?

I give a a few stars for the cast which i think does a great job with what they're given and pretty good SFX work (except for ep.1 which looked extremely cheap at times, like the water splash from the well)",18 October 2017
"Despite being young, relative to StarTrek and new to the Star Trek universe I feel like I needed to throw my opinion in here after watching Star Trek The Next Generation because after watching both I now see how truly terrible Discovery is. It's so overly emotional in a heartless way like everyone is this weird super friendly completely disingenuous person that doesn't exist in real life. There are some good sci-fi concepts but the story and plot is just spoon fed crap. It's all feelings and overly emotional plots as if it's Sesame Street in space only even less relatable than puppets. I don't like to be political and I am a centralist who tries not to judge but this pushed leftist ideologies in every single episode instead of focusing on the actual storyline and having characters that make sense they have to work in concepts that, personally, take away from the experience. Star Trek The Next Generation sold the future of humanity in space to me so much more than this did and with so much less to work with. It still had all the moral issues and ideas in there but without making them a central aspect to the storyline. People weren't crying all the time with happiness or sadness like in Discovery because they were professionals who had a job to do and that simply makes more sense and sold the story in a real way. I really hope they cancel this and someone else who has vision takes over the franchise because with the special effects and CGI it could be absolutely spectacular if they got people who can write in to do the job that I feel they failed to do which is to inspire interest in science and space. If Space X was run by the people in this version of Star Trek they'd never get off the ground.",28 August 2021

"I'm a fan of anything Star Trek I've watched all the Star Trek shows some have been better than others. As far as this one goes: Discovery: 1: my biggest issue with this show is that it shouldn't be titled Star Trek Discovery but the Michael Burnham saves the universe and multiverse... nothing against her but... never has any Star Trek been solely about one single character but about the ship and her crew. (Maybe except the new Piccard show but he's Piccard! Established fan favorite) 2: I'm pro LGBT rights, I'm pro all human rights. However this show goes way over board, when it comes to promoting LGBT, yes In the future I Would hope everything is normalized and everyone is accepted. I'm in the Navy and have been on a ship, we don't go around making out with everyone and crying about everything any chance we can..... we keep it professional at all times, even after working hours I still keep the chain of command in mind and my professionalism in line.

3: calm down with the uniforms.. some are great but most are okay. Better have the great than a warehouse of uniforms.

Those were my criticisms, some things going great:

1: love Spock and CAPT Pike back story's. When you mix original star treks with anything it makes fans thrilled. Season two was great!

2: thank you for brining in some Latin characters, no one ever brings them to the party.

3: wonderful makeup artists!!!!

I would love to work for you Star Trek... please don't hate me.

"More disappointed with Star Trek Discovery each week. The thing I love about trek is the same thing that makes non-trekkies think it's boring. Roddenberry set Trek in a future utopia where all human conflict has been resolved so they are free to explore space as one race, there's no deceit in Starfleet and if there is, it's a rogue captain who will be eliminated. They are peaceful and always seek to avoid conflict with other races. This new series is just a continuation of what Abrams did really. The main character seems to be the only one who embodies the real spirit of Trek and she is fighting against a corrupt, power-hungry, war-mongering Starfleet, which really seems no better than the Klingon Empire at this point. One of the things that really irks me is the lack of voice over in the introduction. I'm not sure what DS9 or V did, but it needs that ""Space, the final frontier..."" to kick it off. The only reason they've cut it out is to try and appear cool and create more distance from the old trek series. If that's what you want to do, then just make a new series with a different name. Don't try and cash in on the name Trek with this generic sci-fi. I would still watch generic sci-fi piece of crap happily, if they weren't trying to sell it to me under the guise of a new trek series.",10 October 2017

Perhaps if CBS had simply called this a re-imagining, the inconsistencies in canon could be dismissed. Buy the story arc was still not interesting.

Every facial expression is overdone, and increasingly so. The rolling eyes, the distorted mouth, the tortured eyebrows, all those make you cringe. I do not know who gave her such a bad advice. In my opinion, less is more when acting. And she is not the only one to crash her acting in such a gross way. So it may be due to a really bad actors direction more than to the actors themselves.

Oh and the worst part, I saw three episodes on demande that I did not even watch to end which only lasted 20 min. and 2 that only lasted 16 min. and guess what folks, they shoved commercials down our throats, on top of it. Also can someone tell us, why the writers aren't even respecting the minimum requirements for someone to be able to participate in space travel?

"I've been a Star Trek fan my entire life. I started with the original series, but fell in love with Star Trek the next Generation. Deep Space Nine (my all time favourite Star Trek show) was simply amazing. I really enjoyed Voyager as well, and even Enterprise had it's moments.

I like the idea of a woman captain ( I liked voyager like i said above), But basically, every male character in Star Trek discovery show is a cowardly, fairly unintelligent wimp, while the most brave characters are female, the smartest characters are female, and the toughest most bad ass characters are of course, female.

The only role males play in this show is look so blatantly pathetic and useless, it makes the female leads look even better by comparison. This trend of Neo feminism in shows (The show The 100 is another example), needs to end.

I could not even finish watching the first episode of this politically driven, neo feminist, social justice warrior propaganda filth.

"Unpopular opinion, but Enterprise was a damn good Star Trek show. Discovery starts promising, builds a likeable cast of characters, and great villains in both the Klingons and the rogue AI of season 2. However season 2 fizzles at the end and season 3's interesting premise is ruined by overly dramatic soap opera-esque nonsense and some of the cringiest forced virtue signaling in television history.

Star Trek has always been about pushing the envelope socially, but the condescending nature of Discovery is mainstream anchor towing, rather than proper rebellion. A truly brave storyline would have been exploring Pike's religious more, or acknowledging the positives of the Klingon's warrior culture (in contrast with the dangerously peaceful, yet naive and sometimes reckless Federation).

This show could have been special, but they played it safe with beating the viewer over the head with ""They/Thems"" instead of writing a compelling story.

Oh, and of course no review is complete without mentioning the cancerously bad Tilly. Perhaps the most unlikable and undeserving character in star trek history.",17 August 2023

That's when the show is not virtue signalling about the amazing representation and diversity that is so in your face it's embarrassing. The stories are flat and predictable. The acting is repetitive. The action is predictable. And weirdly, there's way too many pyrotechnics on the bridge.

This show needs to kill off the lead character and replace them with a likeable and realistic leader. Then focus on delivering meaningful stories about morality and (ironically) the discovery of new ideas and challenges. Until this happens it's just random dramatic situation after random dramatic situation to allow Burnham to cry about things.",1 September 2022
"I think the title of this post describes my review. I'm tolerant and accepting of most views but this series seems to have become a platform for someone's agenda. Star Trek is ultimately escapism and expansion of our perception, but it seems to have become a platform.

Whilst the sci-fi concepts are admirable and thoughtful the emotional aspect is excessive and over laboured.

Whilst the original series can arguably have had a bias this series seems to have gone to the extreme in the other direction. Whilst watching this the views of the creators far out weigh the sci-fi and mind expanding views of the original creators.

"Poor writing and over-the-top production make this is a challenging show to watch. Every episode feels like a Michael Bay or JJ Abrams film - overdone, intense, and lacking strong story and characters. There's so many challenges with this show, I will just summarize:

Little to no character development for anyone not named Burnham - but even Burnham's development is an unpredictable and inconsistent rollercoaster. It's a shame to have so many characters, and do nothing with them consistently. The plot

The season long storylines generally feel long, drawn out, and lacking in payoff. Spattered in-between season long story arcs are episodes that just feel like filler. Season 3 was particularly challenging for this reason - and the final payoff...lets just say that would have been a great episode or maybe a two parter early in the season, allowing the story and characters to move on.

The action sequences are difficult to follow and watch. It just brings flashbacks from trying to watch Transformers.

The Burnham whisper has reached the level of Shatner pauses.

Overall, it feels as if this show was written by a group of high school kids. It's incredibly disappointing that after 3 seasons, they still haven't settled in and improved the writing and flow. Season 3 had a moments that looked promising, for example the episode they visit Trill. But it keeps coming back to the same tropes. What this show needs, is to divert the money away from production and into writing. Take the hint - this style of Star Trek hasn't been successful. Since Nemesis the Trek brand feels like it is ashamed of what it has been, and has unsuccessfully been trying to reinvent its image into something cool and sexy.",12 January 2021

"Here is a Star Trek series so full of inconsistencies that the only consistency is the branding.

Visually it looks stunning. I wish they had been satisfied with updating the look of the ships and the wardrobe and hadn't felt the need to re-imagine core races or indeed, shove everything that defined Star Trek out of the nearest airlock.

There are so many things that are so horrifically wrong with this show that it's hard to know where to start.

Let's look at this from the widest possible perspective: here is one of the most heavily-anticipated television series of all time. Star Trek has one of the largest and most comprehensive fanbases of all science fiction franchises - in TV terms it is the biggest.

So does it hit the mark as a Star Trek? Does it give the fans what they've been waiting impatiently for?

Well, firstly it doesn't fit into the established timeline at all. The technology in Star Trek Discovery is well ahead of the technology featured in Star Trek Voyager and yet it is meant to be set before the Kirk era. In Star Trek Discovery androids appear to be commonplace, whereas over a century on in that same alleged timeline the Federation commission their first ever Android crewmember, Data, in Star Trek The Next Generation. Are they just keeping up with the Joneses - Star Wars has androids so Star Trek has to have them too?

Now I'm not one to get hung up on a single detail. Star Trek Discovery of course follows a secret ship called the Discovery, whose covert status may excuse the fact that a lot of the equipment onboard has never been shown to exist in the Star Trek universe previously. We'll let the androids slide, however I still feel that the disparity between tech-levels introduced by STD is distractingly jarring.

Then again the show goes out of its way to be different from previous Star Treks - this is a fact that the producers admit; it's aimed at bringing in new fans. Retaining existing fans does not appear to be a concern.

So they've re-invented the technology to a timeline-distorting extent, thrown in androids for good measure, invoked a previously unheard of secret section of the Federation - I mean, if this isn't the genesis of Section 31 we're seeing it will undermine the established canon even further. But have they stopped there? You must be joking! We're just getting started.

There's the Vulcan Hello - picture this, allegedly, the Vulcans, a race of pure peace and logic, are famous for blasting any ship they encounter upon first sight. That's not sounding like a race of pure peace and logic to me. Also Vulcans now have this magical ability to appear to non-Vulcans via telepathy in a tangible, immersive vision. The show is taking the franchise more towards fantasy that science fiction.

I could forgive all of that but what I cannot and will not forgive is the reinvention of the Klingons. Why Bryan Fuller advocated this I cannot understand. The new Klingon character design is based on a concept of an aquatic species that was drawn before The Original Series locked down the first Klingon look as basically humans with boot polish on their faces - their look was 'in alpha' for obvious practical and fiscal reasons - so I can completely understand why a producer would want to perfect the look of the species. But instead of perfecting the species as Gene Roddenberry originally imagined it, they've gone back to a concept he in fact specifically rejected and pushed off the table with his own hand. To me that's a major insult to the creator of the franchise and to the fans, particularly those whose hearts are Klingon.

The new, watermelon-headed Klingons don't just look completely different, smoothed down with Gillette precision to hairless fishmen borrowing the wardrobe of the Wraith from Stargate Atlantis; now dripping with jewels and strutting around like drag queens where once they proudly sported the accoutrements of battle; their language has been meddled with too (a language so popular amongst Trekkers that the learning app Duolingo supports Klingon as a language); they now all put on a high-pitched groan when they talk (previously Klingons have been known to have a more guttural tone) and every word seems to have about forty Qs in it, turning the name of their homeworld from Kronos to Qo'noS, i.e. from strong to pretentious. And they top this all off with the ironic story arc that to the Klingons, the preservation of their cultural identity is worth going to war over!

Star Trek Discovery is only wowing me in terms of how terrible it is so far. Half the episodes make no sense and the other half are irrelevant. The show dedicates itself to following a fiercely unlikable Michael Burnam who as the name doesn't suggest is actually a bird, which would be fine if she started to become likeable at any point but she just seems like a self-absorbed whiny hothead who's too big for her boots throughout season 1.

I think this show tries too hard to comment on social agendas and just doesn't try at all to be Star Trek. Star Trek was never traditionally about rogues going round busting heads.

While other franchises were taking their audiences on a visual rollercoaster of lasers and explosions, Star Trek was taking its audience on a journey through the human psyche and exploring philosophical themes from the perspective of an enlightened, united people who have finally overcome their barbaric nature - perfectly summed up by the first episode of Star Trek The Next Generation, Encounter At Farpoint. That was Star Trek's defining greatness.

But where previous Star Treks have managed to execute this well, to disguise their social commentary with decent plot, Star Trek Discovery tries to disguise lack of a decent plot with over-amped social commentary and lack of writers' innovation with over-amped tech. And they use this fantastical, implausible tech to do what... explore strange new worlds, seek out new life and new civilisations? No, just to hook up with a mirror version of themselves.

I'm actually quite disturbed by this show. It is a show that is so aggressive in enforcing liberal ideals - equal rights, diversity, equality, so obsessed with identity as a theme, that it forgets its own identity as a Star Trek.

I have noticed that almost all reviews that give STD a score above 6 tend to say absolutely nothing about the show but just condemn 'the haters'. If this isn't suspicious enough the exact same reviews are copy-and-pasted thousands of times over, hmmm. I assure anyone who is reading this that I am not hating but it's impossible to give this show more than a 3 in my system. That's mostly for production quality and music.

How can anyone who's watched more than one sci-fi show give STD top marks when...

The Expanse is a better gritty sci-fi, The Orville is more reminiscent of Star Trek, Black Mirror better deals with social issues of an imperfect near future, Westworld has a hell of a lot more viewers (STD is the 33rd most popular sci-fi show at time of writing) - plus the characters of every other sci-fi show in history but particularly in Star Trek history, are much more likeable...?

I definitely tried with this show. As an all-time trekker I wanted to love it but my disappointment just grew, unlike Klingon (Q'linQ'oN?) hair.

It's visually quite interesting, if you don't scrutinise it too much. For instance I have no idea why the Discovery's habitation section needs to spin around like a novelty keyring when it makes a jump but it looks kind of cool.

If Star Trek Discovery didn't warp the timeline and was perhaps set after Voyager, then the androids, the apparent degradation of the Federation, the decline of the Klingons as a warrior race and maybe even their hair loss might have made a lot more sense.

I'm still puzzled as to how the crew of the Discovery, particularly Captain Georgiou can't pronounce her surname correctly. Surely her spouse would correct her? 'Honey, it's not meant to rhyme with 'more Joe' it's meant to rhyme with - well there isn't a word that rhymes with 'jaw-jee-ooh' but how hard can it be!'

Without any real science fiction going on these details became hugely distracting - like that potty-mouthed Tilly's breakouts! Surely the extravagant CGI budget could have stretched to rubbing out those hideous puss-filled buboes. Especially if they're not meant to be part of the storyline as their planetoid-like mass might suggest.

If Star Trek Discovery does anything for Star Trek it's that it makes you miss that glorious back catalogue of other Star Treks.",30 May 2018
How did these people graduate from the same Starfleet that produced Kirk and Picard?,24 May 2020
"People used to complain about Kristen Stewart's lack of range, and I can only imagine how blessed this show is for not being the dubious blockbuster that Twilight was. The range of emotions displayed by characters in ST:D are, curiously, the same emotions displayed by someone who's just contracted a bad std: tons of crying, discomfort, fits of anger, and pained whispers. At least Kristen Stewart got better.

As someone else pointed out, there is no discovery in Discovery. Various parts of past iterations of Star Trek are revisited, but nothing new or intriguing is ever added. Oh, nevermind, they have a 'warp drive' that works with spores, they have... They also have... Huh... I'm going to double back on that 'nevermind', actually.

The first time I dropped this series was during the first season; only for me to pick it back up when the second season was launched, and the bad taste left by the first season's bad plot twists had subsided. Riddled with disappointing plot holes and wholly dismissive of the canon, the third season has seen me excluding this show from my netflix list for the last time.",20 January 2021

"I've tried. Really tried. But the series would have a better acceptance if really didnt called itself as Star Trek. It has nothing of Star Trek search, questioning and aura. Is an OK series. And honestly i've saw it the entire 1st season. It took me almost 5 months. But i've finished, cause i had to see it till the end. I was hoping that it would improve and be more like all good Star Trek series. But... it didnt end well. Thus...farewell Discovery. I'm getting back to the original series, which is way more compelling and even till this day has more adventure (even with the old special effects).",10 August 2018
"The good -A new Star Trek series -Production values are high (but...) -Entertaining movielike pilot -Nice spacious sets -Dares to open a new series with a setup pilot

The so so -All uniforms are the same -Klingon speak is annoying and sounds like tok tikh.. toohoh.. hakh. Somehow they are the only aliens we have to hear talking in their own language (btw I'm sure there is not just ONE Klingon language on there home world) -SFX has a CGI feel all over it which is a shame

The bad -Simplistic basic plot (just like the movies) -Questionable motives and character actions -A telescope?.. Really? -Beam me up effect is worse then last series... way to CGI. A laser grid? -Theme music is forgettable

How to improve -We only got to know a few characters (and barely at that) -Be sparse with flashbacks and do not explain the current situation by letting the characters repeat it all (aka lazy writing) -Please no stereotypes and ouch one liners -No giant story arc driven episodes. Episodic nature is one of the strong points of previous Star Trek. One can watch random episodes ande njoy the story confined within. Background story arcs are fine as is continuity. -Hire me ;)",25 September 2017

"I didn't like Janeway. Not at first, not so much by the end. She was not a good leader. Too emotional. But by the end of the series, it was OK.

But now, we have 2 women, not just emotional, but incompetent. And the men in the series are cowards or dismissive (just so the women can be proved right, after all). Do all women leaders need to be so emotional? I wouldn't trust either of them with a leadership position. Too cocky and self sure one minute and then emotional and out of control the next. If Picard or Riker or Sysco acted this way no one would have liked those shows either. If we had incompetent women portrayed this way in a series with the cocky men shown to be right, it would be off putting as well.

The show is retro but the tech is better? I didn't like the idea of Enterprise going back in time, now we go back again? Can no one make a new show in the future of Star Trek? Has every creative brain fled Hollywood? Can no one make something new again? Heck, you don't even have to make it COMPLETELY new, just continue the Star Trek story, but in the, you know, FUTURE.... Why are we still talking about fighting the Klingons?!? I miss NextGen so much. There is just no way to make another show like that again. NextGen didn't need cliff hangers. They just made a good story, with a beginning, middle and end.

"First, no way can Sonequa pull off that she was raised on Vulcan. No possible way. She can't ACT that good. She is certainly no Spock who was half human. She's moody, she's not trained in least. It's a bad match for her to be billed as being raised on Vulcan yet show none of the qualities we knew to grow and love in Spock. I don't think this series will last long. You have Captain Pike in that time period yet a ship that can ""black alert"" and travel like that? Talk about far fetched.

"Just my opinion, You can't say this is in the same universe as Enterprise, ToS, etc... if you are going to re-write the history of said universe, and expect the millions of existing fans to just sit here and take it.

What I haven't understood, since Enterprise; is with all of our CGI, filming and other technological advancements, that can make a fantastic Sci-Fi show of any sort...Why go and make a prequel, that just makes everything that was supposed to have taken place years after this show, look horrible and confusing in the progressive universe? Make a sequel! Not another Enterprise. But, something that takes place 50, 100 or 500 years after these events, so that the CGI and awesome things that take place in the ST universe make sense. You need to come up with some original and creative stories. Stop re-hashing the past, and modified an already written history to fit your unoriginal story telling.

My thought in the first 2 episodes...That's all I am going to watch, you butchered everything that we have already absorbed and accepted as cannon. There is nothing you can do with this show now to redeem it. Expect maybe preemptively cancel it, listen to the fans of old and new, then go back to the idea room, and come up with something that fits properly in the Star Trek Universe. Or Just leave Star Trek alone, and make the show you wanted to, but were to scared to make because it was so weak, you threw the Star Trek name on it, and used some words Trekkies are familiar with to try to suck us in.

Again, just my thoughts after watching.",25 September 2017
For some reason the producers decided to use this show to showcase their one-sided political agenda throughout each episode. It was very obvious to the detriment of the show quality.

"I have watched every Star Trek show ever made and this is NOT Star Trek ?? Just watch series 3 episode 1 and that's me done, will not be watching anymore, it's by far the worst Star Trek series EVER made, it's completely lost what Star Trek is all about, it's way too dark and disturbing, is it called discovery because they've discovered Michael Burnhams different feelings, angry, confused and conflicted Michael Burnham. The plot is confusing and boring, the characters are so unlikable, NEVER before has a Star Trek series been about one character and a very unlikable character at that, Star Trek has always been about hope and discovery and thought provoking ideas. I cannot get behind ANY of the characters because none are likeable, they're all mean and dark, you don't feel or care for any of them, it doesn't bother me if they are in the next episode or not. Sci-Fi is my passion but this is a big let down, let's hope a new and brighter Star Trek is made and follows the success of those before this dark and dismal attempt and let's hope we don't have to wait long before we can say 'Star Treks on Next week, cannot wait to see it' Let's hope the Mandalorian carries on where it left off, so we still have some good Sci-Fi to watch.",25 October 2020

"Watched the series three separate times since it came out. Watched all the YouTube content with analysis to understand others' perspectives on the show. Even read a large number of reviews on IMDB, and yet still I cannot find the magic of Star Trek in this series. The show seems to have missed the opportunity to reinforce deeper concepts that really good sci-fi wrestles with, and instead treats the show as just another cash in by pouring ingredients together and hoping it tastes good.

And it would be hard to ignore early reviews, most of which came the day of or immediately following the premier, that praise it without having sat with it for a while and digested its attempts at being more than the sum of its parts. And yes, I know the world moves on with each generation, but Star Trek has enchanted many different generations, whereby someone who liked next generation didn't feel alienated by the original.

You don't have to be a fanatic to get the very smart way current events, philosophical debates, and existential wonder all played nuanced roles in Star Trek. But this, Star Trek discovery, does not share that magic...And I tried, really tried to understand its ethos, especially if it was changing form to help reach out to newer audiences.",29 April 2018

"Star Trek: Discovery is a very distant cousin of the Star Trek franchise. It is about on the same level as ST: Enterprise--which it reboots out of existence. Very good special effects. Fair acting (although the Captain and First Officer do not come off as people who've known each other for 7 years (and who is the principal character, the Captain or the First Officer?) But there is one big problem--The Orville, a show that much more recreates the light-handed approach of TOS (with some TNG elements popping up in the latest episode). Discovery is a much more heavy-handed thing, with neither the brain nor the heart that ST is known for.

And Discovery insists on the season-long story arc concept which is getting old. It was innovative when Wiseguy did it in the late '80s, or Dr Who in recent years (although the 4-6 part episodes where best). Bryan Fuller is no Seth McFarland, let alone Gene Roddenberry, and it is at his feet blame for Discovery's shortcomings must be laid.",24 September 2017

The heart of the show is not up too other star trek versions by far the worst version. The quality of the show is good the characters and casting are the issue.

"Could have been a lot better then it was. I'm a Trekkie since I was a kid so I was looking forward to this show for a long time. I know they wanted to go in different direction but they went to far this time from what I saw tonight. I don't care about who is playing what in the show, if your good at acting and the story is good then it will be good. In this case the acting was meh, not bad but not close to being great and the story was not wow considering how many delays and how long they had to write it. It is way too dark and doesn't jive with any other Star Trek series before it. If they really thought about it better they should have said it is taking place in the kelvin time line and set it after the events of the rebooted movies, but they didn't so they messed up there.

Having said that I will also say CBS messed up with a pay wall system. It should be free as that put a huge dent in me wanting to get invested into the show. I'm not being cheap but I'm not going to pay for another service for a show that doesn't grip me like TNG or DS9 or STV and TOS. In all honesty The Orville is closer to TNG in many respects than STD is. I know Orville can be a bit silly at moments but I felt better after the show, more up lifted and just happier then after tonight's Discovery.

I never thought I would say this but unless I hear it getting a lot better then it was tonight, this will be the first time I will pass on a Star Trek series, hell I even watched every Enterprise episodes faithfully when many thought that series was meh. Enterprise was still closer to the Star Trek we loved our whole lives than this was tonight.

I hope CBS listens to what people are saying and don't discount everyone's voice for no reason or say we hate it or dislike because of a women is playing the captain that is just dumb ( besides I liked Captain Janeway so you can't say I care about that) It's just not Star Trek the way it should be. It reminds me of a saying my grandfather always told me ""Just because you can do something does not mean you should.""

Ships, uniforms, tech and weapons and even aliens look different. Normaly I would say fine, why not. But in this case it is one big NO from me. And it is not just the looks. The characters don't fit me either. Flat, empty and boring. Story? Either too slow or too hectic, too forced. Just like when you are sleeping in your bed. You wake up but think to yourself ""Just five more minutes."", but your five minutes turn into fifty, you realise that you have oversleped and now you don't know what do first and in nine out of ten case it ends bad. But then maybe it is just me. Maybe I am just not willing to accept the changes. But simply put. This is not Star Trek to me. I saw fan movies that have more Star Trek in their five or ten minutes lenght. Heck even The Orville feels more like a Star Trek.

It has high production values for a TV series and the VFX are decent to very good.

Unfortunately that is not what Star Trek is about... This thing has way too much action and is only focused on one character, it is also dark and somewhat gritty, which again defies what Star Trek should be...

The style is unmistakably copied from the J.J. Abrams Trek movies with the visual tone and camera angles, all of which I personally was never a big fan of.

"Short of the Star Trek uniforms and spaceship vague resemblance, this is a painful drama in space show or as someone else coined perfectly, a 'Space love boat'.

This is one of the worse show I've watched. I'm 55. I spent more time fast forwarding over the emotional dribbles than watch the plot after season 2. I can't stand to watch the heroine's face anymore with those puppy eyes. I hope she doesn't get burned from this. I feel Saru has the best role. No one will pin the stigma of Discovery on his back since we can't see his face. How sad is that?

The first season had a lot of potential. The second season slipped into non-Star Trek territory -- or more to the point, the Star Treks we've had since the dreaded Enterprise series of emotional wrecks, immature adults, and drama queens. And why this odd and unhealthy obsession showing someone going rogue teetering on the brink of emotional instability, if not immaturity is hard to stomach.

I like drama when it's expected. It's NOT expected in space for me. I watched more than once the Gilmore Girls, because I expected drama there. But spaceman drama is sad. Appealing to everyone at any cost leaves many of us so dissatisfied.

Life is already too nuts to have to watch grown up actors in pajamas play drama in space. Please, bring back the Star Trek philosophical community conundrums and the old writers, including those on the Voyager series. In the end, Voyager was closer to TOS then this... huh, can't name it.

But unfortunately I think it's just a little 'too nice' for me (and I'm a lefty!) with over half the characters bringing a level of cringe I've never felt in a tv show before.

The problem is, I've just grown to dislike many of the characters and their over the top, love conquers all, ""go team"" attitude. It's all become very ""meh"".

If you put some manatees in a tank with a bunch of balls that had Facebook memes written on them and let the manatees randomly compile plot lines and techno babble, at the very least it would be indistinguishable from Star Trek Discovery, and it might even be better. By the way, they've been clearly doing some ADR work trying to hide some of the social activism from their episodes, but it's pretty weird and transparent when they're dubbing new stuff in to over-the-shoulder shots from the opposite angle. Very awkward. Don't waste your time if you haven't watched anything other than the pilot. It gets much, much worse.

Original Review:

6 out of 10. Based on first two parts, not totally horrible and very amazing looking and sounding.

It's not as bad as I expected. So that's good. Superficial production values overall are extremely high. However, the dialogue and themes seem more like people not that into Star Trek or who've never before worked on the shows who have just done a rush brush-up on the older material and are trying to mimic it. I don't get a sense of these being longtime fans or former writers for the other shows with a deep sense of it that are involved now. Feels like a new group or something. Sort of lacks the soul of trek. The prequel movies, though, seemed to be done by people who barely even brushed up on the older stuff at all, in addition to them not being longtime fans or contributors.

Ignoring Michelle Yeoh's stilted delivery, the dialogue at times in the first two parts is lacking in subtlety and subtext. It's all people saying what they mean exactly, filling the audience in, and moving the plot along. The scene where the EVA happens at the mystery object had some unrealistic filler dialogue. Many of the other lines were more Star Trek mimickry. The crew we first meet is already talking like they're in the ""family zone"" that other shows had to take seasons to eventually have an arc to get to. There's also a lack of real ensemble cast here. It's focusing on the first officer. Don't expect Game of Thrones, ST: TNG, or later DS9. On this first officer, I don't find myself empathizing with her or rooting for her enough, possibly because they've written her so outspoken and not demonstrated her own compassion for others.

It appears to be set in the same universe as the prequels, just a decade prior and with a different set of uniforms. I am warming up to what they've done to the Klingons, which in the Star Warsified, nepotism-rife prequels were already moving in this kind of direction as far as look. The Klingons' story, though, might end up being the most interesting part in all this. I also like this modified anime-influenced look better than the prequels' Apple thing, even if there seem to be a lot of super skinny people in super skinny tailored clothing and still too much fake lens flare. The sound is also not so dainty and video game like JJ Abrams'. Hand phasers have a really nice snap, like closer to Terminator.

The plot itself is pretty smartly written, even if the dialogue had issues. There's a point where we learn about how the Vulcans dealt with the Klingons that I found very sophisticated. I feel that perhaps they're focusing on developing a war with the Klingons because of all the attention that Axanar lawsuit brought, thinking this plot had a lot of potential if fan stuff was going there. That makes them followers in that regard, but technically they do own the rights to it. It's really a cheap shot requiring fan projects to be less than 15 minutes from now on. For all my problems with the JJ Abrams outings, he was smart enough to recommend they drop the suit. Unfortunately, they did not, and I wouldn't fault people for boycotting this as a result.",25 September 2017

"Every episode was a thrill. I just couldn't wait to see what strange new objects or planets or circumstances that was about to unfold on this episode. The strange remarks of Data, the inspirational storytelling capabilities of Picard, the incredible fearlessness and leadership of Janeway, the hard and internally vulnerable fatherhood of Sisko.

Fighting the Borg for survival, evading Q:s elaborate and potentially reality-threatening pranks, helping planets and civilizations come together in an effort to better all of the galaxy - basically trying to do what no one has done before.

That is Star Trek.

Which brings me to my point: This is _not_ Star Trek.

Don't get me wrong - I hate toxic gatekeeping fans that are against change, female leadership or the effort to create an even more inclusive franchise. I am a Trekkie, but a reasonable and inclusive one.

But.. where's the adventure? Where's the non-forced strength of the crew? What are their background-stories? Where's the Borg-esque threats? Where's Q? Where's anything!?

The whole show centers around a fragile, stress-inducing character that Never offers relief. The few times she shows strength or resolve it is by delivering some cliche line paired with sub-par acting which entirely ruins the immersion, makes me flinch with cringe and either skip ahead or turn off the TV.

I like crying strongmen, because it displays reality. But every episode? Every 15 minutes of every episode?

I'm very sad to say it, but I've given this show exactly 3 seasons and 9 episodes and I am not finishing the last one.

This show can be great in many different aspects, but this is to Star Trek what McDonalds is to hamburgers;

A quick, hungerfilling bite that'll leave you with a bitter aftertaste and regrets.

My only wish and prayer is for this franchise not to end with these. Please bring back Kirk with Anson Mount.",20 December 2020
"There are some great characters in this show like Captain Pike, Lorca, Saru... but the main character Michael is such a drag. So much drama and crying and sad faces, yet she's this god like hero. This show is all about her basically. Everything else gets out on the side. The graphics are amazing, they did a great job with that. But I feel like I'm watching some garbage drama series. SO MANY LOVE STORIES. And some of them just forcing their way in. There's a gay couple and their love story takes up so much of the screen time. You don't need all of that. But seriously please get rid of Michael. She's a plague to this series. So predictable. This is not Star Trek.",27 January 2020
"First let me say I really liked the first three seasons. Good characters, good stories, lots of diversity. I actually liked the continuity format that revolves around a prominent central narrative. It follows a trends that was tentatively explored way back in the 'Next Generation' days with the Maqui rebellion and Borg war and had completely dominated by the time of 'Enterprise'. It's what works best in dramatic television for snagging the commitment of viewers. I even thought they did a respectable job recreating the 'look' of the original Enterprise by focusing more on colors, shapes and themes rather recreating by rote the old sets out of cardboard and Christmas lights.

At the end of season three it was plain that a whole cycle had been completed. Season three begins with a whole new core narrative that conveniently deals with the whole timeline-technology problem and cooks up a whole new Galaxy spanning crisis.

The central and formative element in every version of Star Trek is the character and personality of the Captain. The new Captain, like the original Kirk, is by nature a brash and often overconfident rule breaker. The problem I'm having with the third season is that the Captain presents as an idealistic overachiever who never fails, is always right and always manages to save the day flawlessly and almost single-handedly.

The Star Trek franchise has always offered a model for America's highest aspirations. Every version has reflected the social values and organizational aspirations of a great liberal democracy and has always been appropriate for its time. Of the two present dramas in the franchise, 'Picard' succeeds very well by parenting characters who are damaged and know they are damaged while constantly struggling to transcend their limitations. 'Discovery', offers a main character who acts with absolute certainty and little reflection in every situation with little feedback and almost absolute consensus from everyone in the crew. This may have been appropriate for Kirk in the sixties but it doesn't work for me in 2021, as it comes off as mere arrogance and presumption.

Being an avid Trekkie I haven't given up yet. In the first episode the new president of the Federation pretty much stated my case. Succeeding episodes however, have veered unfortunately in another direction.",29 December 2021
"Long ongoing story, and no humor. Next generation with data and Q had lot of funny moments. This series just drags on, and hard to care about the characters. Poor acting or bad writing, or something else. TNG many didn't like ensign Crusher, at least people felt something.",26 March 2021
"Good show, but so much misses the mark. Feels like woke BS is being forced in. Also, feels like everyone gets to be captain when most are far from qualified. The plausible realistic factor is fully stripped from this show and feels more like a Disney princess fantasy. Also, much of it is starting to get ""Days of our lives"" drama like a 15 minute segment. Are they trying to ruin Star Trek?",13 December 2021
"poor writing, bad story, lack of grit... well I could repeat this for 5 lines and fill the gaps to reach the minimum number of lines for a review. Doing this I would be doing the same as the writers of this show... Slow down everything to non-sense level factor 10. There are positive points however : this show has a good budget. Some cast members are great. We could have expected something huge from this. BUT NO!!! Let's warp forward : I condemn the writers and producers under GENERAL ORDER 4... Fans will understand...",24 October 2017
"So, the CBS execs had the rights to a show with a huge following and they needed some quick bucks. Out comes the product of their digestive disorder, known as Star Trek Discovery.

It's a shitstorm of awful pointless spineless characters that keep dying randomly and a storyline that makes even less sense, except someone of the scripwriter team saw the game of thrones and decided the most successful shows kill off one of the main characters each episode.

Except there are no main characters here. That is to say they're all random, inhuman, unlikeable and insufferable, and I couldn't care less every time one of them dies, but then they bring in someone equally useless and pointless.

So, if you're looking for a show that will waste your time this is the perfect choice. If you're looking for some entertainment, look elsewhere.

If you're a fan of Star Trek, look elsewhere.

If you got half a brain and don't know what to do with the other half, look elsewhere.

If you're a lobotomized Trump clone, this is the perfect show for you, enjoy!",23 October 2017
"After reading some of the reviews, I see I'm not alone in thinking this show is lost. I'm still on season 1 but am already wondering why it is still being aired. I am amazed that it has reached 4 seasons. It is dark, depressing and nothing like the Star Trek future we know and love. Hope is what we need, now more than ever, but everything I've seen gives us none. The world has started down a slippery slope that this show reflects. In stead of bringing us all together, it is nothing but divisive. Certainly not tolerant like our future should be. Discovery is certainly politically correct as all shows are these days but, as in reality, you need strength to survive. This show needs a stronger script or perish. Our future is very bleak if this show is any indication and I don't know how Kirk is ever going to fix it. Especially since it will take a long time to fix this mess. Take the Star Trek name off this show, it does not deserve the title. Fix it or end it.",11 September 2022
"*Previous Star Trek shows = Thought provoking science fiction.

*Star Trek Discovery = Someone gets sucked into space every 5 seconds.

"Really great visual effects but fails in every other aspect !

Besides great visual effects Star Trek : Discovery fails in every other aspect. ST:D doesn't have a soul. Good there is another ST:TOS alike series - Orville. If you want new good and real Star Trek - watch Orville, its Like Star Trek the original series / Deep Space 9. Orville is the best Star Trek i have seen since DS9 even its not a Star Trek. If you haven't seen Orville and you are ST fan watch Orville, even if you don't like American Dad, Family guy or Ted i insure you Orville is nothing like that, just watch 3rd episode - about a girl and you will feel like you are watching a relay good STTOS episode with some comedy elements.",26 September 2017
"Thanks to torrents I didn't have to pay the stupid fee CBS is trying to get for this. As a sci fi action show goes, it doesn't suck. The folks that created Battlestar Galactica pulled off a more modern a darker retake on the original series. The STD have not from where I sit.

It just looks dark and dreary with mutiny and chaos around every corner for no particular purpose other the self indulgence.

Don't care for the new Klingon look. They pretty much killed B'Lana Torris' possibility to exist. The Klingon of STD are a cross between a reptiles and mammals. There's no way cross breeding with humans would ever work.

I also see that comedians of the future will laugh at the white guys. Remember how the first black guy in TOS was sure to die? Well now when you see a white male, you'll know that his character is a tool, a schmuck or insignificant.

Thank goodness I didn't pay for it!",25 April 2018
"The original Star Trek was about human progress, exploration and written by some of the best sci fi writers around. Yes there were fights and battles but the Prime Directive set a tone of peace and non-exploitation. TNG stayed true to the Prime Directive and added the acting skills of Patrick Stewart plus the whole Klingon culture was developed. And Q.

STD betrays this legacy. I'm up to episode 5 and losing hope. The tone is war-like with none of the celebration of humanity's progress which is the basis of ST's identity. It's OK to harm and exploit a new species for ""the war effort""...??? huh? This is not the Star Trek I know and love. And if they wanted to do ""dark"" ... they failed on that, too. BSG was very dark but a great show. STD is too stupid and shallow to be dark. The Klingons are re-cast as monstrous one dimensional ""bad guys"". Their scenes and costuming are actually painful to watch. The star fleet characters do stupid things that no one with two brain cells to rub together would do. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief on some of the science fiction bits ... but it's a stretch to ask me to believe star fleet officers would be moronically stupid. This series seems like more of a pro-war propaganda film than Star Trek. I like the main character and premise - 3 stars for that - but what a sad disappointment and betrayal of the Star Trek legacy.",15 October 2017
"If it ""show"" dont call (dont insult) Star Trek, and call herselft as ""bla-bla-bla an space story"" it can be decent (only decent, a lot of anothers series had more Works on plots and characters).

But this ""crap"" can be call ""Star trek"" and this don't is and never will be. It's is a product with bad quality only create to destroy real Star Trek legacy Actors are bad their characters are too far from Star Trek ideals and they only serve as a moral negation of all that any Star Trek carácter needs to be.

Please, dont waste more resources on that insult to Star Trek and fire out all crew from showrunners to the most irrelevant actor on it.

At least, I can see (and I will see it again and again) the rest of the series of Star Trek, but I no waste a simple second more on this crap.",4 April 2018
"Perhaps my bias as a Star Trek fan prevents me from seeing the entertainment here, but try as I might, I cannot. Its failures are severe and numerous, and extend well past lazy and contrived plots. I somehow made it through two seasons and wish I could have my time back. I urge anyone who enjoys Star Trek to steer clear. This lacks everything which made it such an amazing franchise.",15 October 2020
"This was even worse than I expected on about every level. The abramesque feel I can live with but the whole episode was horrible from writing to acting, the completely unnecessary changes to the klingons and I guess the transsexual character of Michael certainly didn't help. The opening song/credits thing was the worst, most uninspired and dull opening of any of the trek series by far. Combine that with the paywall cbs has attached to this, this is the first trek series I have no problem with skipping. I think I'm just going to pretend it doesn't exist.",28 September 2017
"The worst series of star trek that has been made. Klingons that look like cockroaches, horrible ships, predictable history and total disrespect to the canon of the original saga. It does not make sense that they have changed everything so much that it looks more like Galactica or Star Wars than what Star Trek has always been. The truth, I detest it.",4 February 2018

"Others have critiqued this travesty of a show and said it all. It has absolutely NOTHING to do with ""Star Trek"" as we know it. It's just a display of a politically-correct liberal agenda, where 75% of the crew are female, and any male character is either evil, weak, or gay.... and a few vague references to ""Klingons"" (which incidentally have nothing in common with the Klingons in all the other ST shows). 80% of each episode is spent with the characters examining their feelings & emotions in soul-baring monologues, and 20% poorly written 'action' with no relevance or continuity, where the ""good & strong females"" dominate the ""weak & evil"" males.. It's like some left-wing liberal pro-LGBT amateur stage drama. It's supposedly a prequel set before TOS, yet has technology far more advanced than even TNG or Voyager (spore drive?).. The main character Michael Burnham (adopted sister of Spock????) (It has been stated the character is a female (action-hero?) with a male name to promote 'gender-fluidity') and has only 2 expressions - either smarmy smugness or some weird pained constipated look of puzzled curiosity..... The whole thing is a total mess and should never have reached the screen.",23 March 2019
"Gene Roddenberry said; ""Star Trek was an attempt to say that humanity will reach maturity and wisdom on the day that it begins not just to tolerate, but take a special delight in differences in ideas and differences in life forms. [...] If we cannot learn to actually enjoy those small differences, to take a positive delight in those small differences between our own kind, here on this planet, then we do not deserve to go out into space and meet the diversity that is almost certainly out there.""

But in STD humanity is just as it is now, petty, selfish, greedy and biased.

As such this does not envision the spirit of star trek in any way. It does give us some decent scifi stories though.......so I won't be giving it a one for that reason.",8 April 2019
"I have been a watcher of Star Trek for decades. I loved most of the shows.

I really dislike Discovery in so many ways. The acting is great and the cast is good but the directors were just out to make Star Trek like all other programs.

Hey lets drop the F-bomb for no apparent reason. Lets make Klingons look different to any Klingon before. Vulcans are now xenophobes. There is no real humour, everyone seems to dislike everyone else.

Ts just depressing. I really hoped that half the crew would die in some outlandish way then I could have at least laughed at it once.

I have no empathy with any characters. I have no sympathy for the hurt they suffer.

Please end it and leave the Star Trek universe relatively unscathed.",30 November 2017

Is it so hard to understand why the old shows were a success? It appears so.",25 October 2017
Without a doubt the worst Star Trek series ever produced. Who ever wrote this should be ashamed. Couldn't they at least tried to stick to the science and adventure instead of the soap opera drama and skewed relationships that have nothing to do with science and exploration Gene first brought to the world the way we all grew to love and appreciate. I can't express enough how much this series sucks! And now they are going to try and destroy Picard with their Soap opera drama. It feels more like they are trying to Express their social and political ideology rather then the adventure and exploration Trekies Crave. SO SO SAD.,23 April 2022

You complicate things for entire season without any mean and point and then resolve it all in one last episode. I don't learn anything, there is no moral and higher idea behind the episodes. Creators of this abomination, you should watch episode or two of TNG before filming this c..p...

In one word, disgrace!",15 February 2018
"What a piece of garbage! I'm not a true Trekkie, but I've watched every Star Trek show in existence from start to finish at least 10 (or more) times. I love Star Trek. It is my favorite show of all time. I can watch it endlessly and I never get tired of it. This one, I couldn't watch past episode 4 of season 1, and those 4 episodes were torture.

First, what the heck did you do to Klingons? They look ridiculous and they all sound like they have a sock in their mouth! I get it, its the artificial teeth, but none of the Klingons had that speech problem in TNG, DS9 or Voyager, despite the grizzly looking teeth. The makeup is so plastic looking and not believable at all. The uniforms are something else altogether, oh my god. These guys are supposed to be tough and dangerous, but still likable. Instead, they are freaks with a sock in their mouth dressed like Soul Train performers or somethings.

Second, why does the show have to be so dark and depressing? What's all that about war, war, war??? Star Trek is about exploration. Hello!!! Boldly go where no man has gone before? Rings any bells? Every single character is ANNOYING like there's no tomorrow! Every single one. There's always someone a bit annoying on any Star Trek, but here - every single of them!

And then, what's with the ""Michael"" name? What does it mean? Not only the character is annoying, the name is a murder. I can go on for a long time about all the stupidity in this show, but I'm pretty sure you get the idea.

It's back to watching the real Star Trek for me (for 100th time, but it's not really a problem). I hoped for a quality reboot, but that didn't happen. Garbage, utter garbage.",11 March 2020

Half of the cast are acting really poorly, it doesn't follow it's own rules, it rips off J.J. Abrahams directing shamelessly and the crew seems quite dumb at times and their technology highly unrealiable. It is not all bad: This show has some of the best make-up I have seen in a long time. Amazing. The vfx also looks really good, and the relationships between characters are really good. Also the biological warp engine intreages me. But the overall bad acting, dialogue and the disrespect towards star trek makes this show hard to watch for me.",18 February 2019
"Never felt a star trek had a main character in any show before, it always kept switching perception and narrator. The fact you have a wide lens telling the story does shape the story. For a show that often ran many seasons this was to me a key aspect of the show as it let the even the smaller side characters grow over the seasons and was one reason often it was not until season 3 or higher the show peaked.

Discovery or as ive become fond of calling it STD has a chosen one, a main character that have that classical hero aura around her. But feel her sharp glow hides the other characters on the ship and lessens them in comparison as the hero always solves the issue.

The fact the Hero with capital H is unlikeable also. Not sure how they managed to accomplish that feature as since the main character is the POV you tend to take his/her side even when his clearly in the wrong.

Its a shame as do feel it is a part of the show that keeps it from improving from a single weak first season, it does not invest in building a stronger foundation. It wants every single episode to be a peak even at the cost of the future. If not for this inherent flaw feel this show might have been able to come into its own if it just ran long enough now though it has nothing that invested that will build it blew everything it had going and stands naked with a full cast of unlikeable characters nobody knows anything about and a Hero that is not stepping up and carrying the show but even being its weak point.",15 October 2020
"I can't believe how far from good Star Trek Discovery has become. It actually started out well. Jason Isaacs as a war captain was excellent, but with the twists on the end of the first season they completely lost their way and now it is the televisual equivalent of a toddler dribbling a football toward a nonexistent goal.

Barely any of the characters resonate and in fact the protagonist (questionable term here) Michael Burham positively annoys. Michelle Yeoh, usually excellent, here plays a monodynamic character. Other characters range from grating to just awful with the recent sole exception of David Ajala's 'Book'. And the closing moments of the second series left me wondering who the actual eff behaves like this in real life. The schmaltzy whispered emotional pap dragging on and on leaving you screaming at them to just get on with it FFS!

The addition of Anson Mount as Captain Pike was good for a while and I am excited to see the Enterprise Series when and if it makes our screens as announced pre-covid, but for the series here in question, It is a Discovery that you have wasted your time in a slow descent into uberemotional toss. Give it a miss if you love Trek. This ain't Trek.",12 December 2020

Discovery abandons any intellectual material previously characteristic of Star Trek and swaps them for explosions and CGI effects.

"I must say with much disdain that this is not Star Trek. I was originally excited to hear about Star trek coming back to the small screen, but no more. This is not even a hollow shell of what it used to be, it's just. not. Star Trek. Since when did Mr. Roddenberry's vision of a ""wagon train to the stars"" become cast by the wayside in favour of action that does not fuel the story? There is very little exploration, and frankly most of the characters are detestable, which is fine in most cases but not if they are going to be portrayed as the good guys rather than the baddies. Another thing is the classic characters of Sarek, Spock, and Pike. They are shadows of their former selves. Didn't Leonard Nimoy come up with the Vulcan nerve pinch so Spock could avoid violence? Pike on the other hand is just shamed by everyone almost every waking minute. Crew insubordination is also out of control, if anyone else in any other Star Trek show talked to their superiors the way the crew of the Discovery talk to theirs, they would be relieved from duty or worse. I have nothing against the visual aesthetic of the show and the Discovery looks amazing, but to have Kurtzman pitch this as Prime Timeline? No way.",15 April 2020

1) Cast. The lead is OK. Sonequa Martin-Green as Michael Burnham is confident and believable. It is due to her this Trek series gets 2 stars from me.

But the rest? Even Jason Isaacs - normally a solid, reliable actor - falters. I don't care for the new aliens, they are too predictable.

2) Script & Plot - non existent. what the hell. So jaded, unreal, unsympathetic. I don't believe a word these people are saying. So much rubbish I have not heard on TV for a long time. Basically, you just know the script were harried along and written by a talentless hack. They say all these stupid things, make those silly speeches to each other, it is so basic I could scream. Only Trump supporters will find these story lines interesting.

How it got 4 seasons is unbelievable. It try's to make up for it's poor script and cast by taking the story beyond the ridiculous, the whole alternate time line was cringeworthy.

When you think how much this show cost to make its disgusting its is so bad, I can only imagine how that money could of been used on a show that was struggling for budget, maybe something like ""dark matter"".

And the whole shows visuals is over the top... It's like the movies instead of like how the shows have been.

Vapid, uninteresting and the characters that are not flat are annoying (the cowardly science officer for instance). He doesn't seem to even be a very good science officer

"5th episode, getting interesting and I'm wavering on forgiving the Klingons looking feminine. I want to really see the next episode.

4th episode, still kinda hate it. This show is going down and I hope will be replaced by a version that we actually like. The main thing that I can think of is the crew acting more seriously, as they just act with a bichy attitude.

Saw the 3rd episode and I'm starting to enjoy it, but still a lot of bichy attitude from characters. I would expect more professionalism from the ship crew.

I like Star Trek but I hate this crap knock off series. Gave this show 2 stars after seeing 2nd episode, but I was thinking of giving it 1 star, because of the dialogue, story line and about half of the actors. The worst star trek series. Marina Sirtis was right, save your money. I see it just like most of the other bad reviews and I would rather watch any other series like The Orville comedy, which is much better and more realistic than this ""drama"".",1 October 2017
"I know it's supposed to be a Star Trek show so they want to make it look good but the starship and its consoles looks so advanced and futuristic, how do they hope us to believe this was supposed to happened before the Kirk era, it makes no sense.

As a big Star Trek fan I was always hoping to find a new show that will explore the future further than Star Trek Voyager, why do they always look to the past now, it's ludicrous.

And if this is supposed to take place in the same universe as TOS, TNG, DS9, VOY and ENT, respect the facts already set in stone, or do something else and do not call it Star Trek.",3 November 2017
"I liked the series' pace and action, even if it wasn't as interesting as previous entries in the canon. But I couldn't make it more than a couple episodes into Season 3 because of the shaky camera. It's always seemed like a weak filmmaking trick whenever I've seen it elsewhere, but it was plain nauseating here. And the show just wasn't entertaining enough to suffer through it.",26 January 2021
"Viewers should avoid this like the plague.

I believe that, back in the day, Star Trek fans mounted a letter writing campaign to have a new Star Trek series brought to TV. That, along with interest generated by the many successful conventions, resulted in TNG, or so I've heard.

With Star Trek: Discovery, the reverse should apply. It is so woefully inadequate that viewers should mount a campaign to have it cancelled on the grounds that it actually damages the franchise.

Long may it be forgotten.",29 December 2018
"The most obvious thing to point out about this show is that it is not Star Trek. Nothing about it is Star Trek. If you just changed the names of things, it would resemble no Star Trek episode or movie ever made. The Orville started off as an apparent parody and comedy inspired by Star Trek but has transitioned fairly well into a proper Star Trek homage, the comedy is more subdued and the stories and character development more impactful like you'd expect on Star Trek. If you're looking for a ""new"" Star Trek, go watch that.

But even if you were to consider what this show is, without letting the fact that it's pretending to be Star Trek yet besmirching that name color your review, this show is utterly terrible in every facet. The ""enemy"" is uninspired, the combat is inexplicable, there is no real tension. It has obvious and needless political messaging everywhere, which are always bad signs in a show unless it's parody, and this isn't a comedy. The story is weak. The acting is weak. Then let's get into the awe inspiring stupidity that reveals that this is just a means to ""show off"" and spend money.

The cinematography in this series is atrocious. Perhaps among the worst I've ever seen. It's certainly possible to do worse than a neutral cheaply made indie shot. The shots in this series are routinely painful to watch. There are lens flares everywhere which makes no sense given the contrast this implies would cause serious eye strain on those on the ship. And lens flares THROUGH the screen? And this ""screen"" that's a window but really it's a screen? How about the lighting on this ship. We're at a binary star so let's ""2017"" it up and show all the light in the scenes coming from the star system for dramatic effect -- so if we were at warp this ship would be nearly pitch black. EM waves vibrating a ship? CAMERA SHAKE IN SPACE, WHILE NOTHING IS HAPPENING? Constant. Jump. Cuts. EVERYWHERE. And camera angles at 30 degrees because WHY? The weapons fire looks like something I could cook up in mspaint and not at all menacing.

There are dozens of serious oversights and errors in the first two episodes alone, and that's accompanying the cinematography that just aims to be ""original"" or something. Why would a beacon be lit sending signals IN ALL DIRECTIONS if all the ships are going to warp in from the *SAME EXACT DIRECTION*.. and even worse, through the binary star formation? Through the accretion disk? ???? This first officer has served for 7 years under the same captain and is yet shown to be CONSTANTLY insubordinate and hostile, showing no trust and no apparent connection at all. Yes, we can't see people from orbit, but we can see that drawing in sand THROUGH A STORM CLOUD. It's apparent not a single thought was given to anything in this show. Nothing is consistent, everything is absurd.

I'd give this show a 2/10 if I even enjoyed a second of it, and I'm even willing to look past the obvious lie that is calling itself a Star Trek, but that's too generous. This is the worst TV show I have ever seen.",8 November 2017

"So this is the tale of the discovery to find and explore new strange and awkward ways to soapy, cheesy and sniveling.

The production is state of the art and the acting too. There is a lot of good here but also unbearable episodes without a real red wire to lead the interest and just a big ocean of whining and hugging.

The old tradition of Star Trek in the secondary and potentially boring episodes was to set up an odd sience issue to resolve mostly in a no harm and no scare, but here if you pick the wrong episode or also in some season ending double episodes you just watch hours of people from the whole universe in a crying ang hugging human clichè.",13 December 2021

I'm a big Star Trek fan and a big Michelle Yeoh fan; I lasted about 40 minutes into this mess before I turned it off and went back upstairs. The books I've been reading are far more interesting and tell much better stories. Better writers are out there, CBS just didn't hire them.",25 September 2017

"First season primitive graphics. Characters one and two dimensional. Predictable plots. Michael is a closed minded, bigoted, reactionary character not worthy of empathy. Most if the characters are also pretty bigoted and closed minded. Thank goodness for skip ahead. Second season graphics a bit better. Ship motion through space better in original Star Trek. Characters are still one and two dimensional with soap opera like dialog, direction, and acting. Later episodes are getting a bit better. Never liked Mudd episodes. Again, thanks for the application skip ahead feature. Dialog really bad. Michael continues to be a very flawed character, though very well acted, I wonder how much better the show would be if there were some decent writers and directors involved. Third Season: hope things improve. Tracking this show and Picard are the only reasons I got CBS All Access.",11 December 2019
"Star Trek is about a positive vision of the future, something for the human race to aspire to.

This has the Star Trek ships and scanners but the characters are the biggest bunch of psychologically unbalanced individuals I've ever seen.

I'm on season 4 now and if I have to endure the bridge crew looking at the captain like a bunch of love sick / frightened puppies, I'm not sure I'm going to make it to the end.

Where is the science fiction? There is no sense of wonder. No hope for a future where people are equal. No strong leader. Instead we get Michael Burnham who whispers most of her lines and cries often. The sets are great. The plots are occasionally silly. The characters are amazingly weak and one dimensional. We get it, in the future women are strong and men are dithering fools. In the future humans have only 3 facial expressions: sadness, smugness, and confusion. The only good performances are by Michelle Yeoh, who plays the adorably villainous Philippa Georgiou and Doug Jones who plays Saru.",27 November 2020
"Star Trek for people who don't like Star Trek, yet paradoxically are supposed to be prepared to pay for it up front?

I've yet to encounter a single Star Trek fan over the age of 25 who has given this the thumbs up. Recent years have had their fair share of terrible reboots like Ghostbusters, Knight Rider, hell even the first round of Star Wars prequels, and unfortunately STD is no different. It's a classic example of putting highly sought after intellectual property in the hands of generic entertainers and waving goodbye to a treasure held in high regard across generations of viewers. Put a franchise in the hands of a fan and you get JJ Abrams's Star Wars. Put it in the hands of a generic director and you get his Trek reboots, ultimately costing Paramount over $150m in net losses and cancelation. This disaster is no different, it has all of the hallmarks of everything that was wrong with the reboot movies, but they don't care, don't listen, and plow it into the mud anyway.

There's only so much a fandom will take being kicked in the balls before there is no turning back and never trust the studio again, even if they come up with something half decent in future they will automatically be shot down by default for trying to fool people once.

STD has roped in some people like Frakes purely for PR reasons, but there are no Star Trek fans at the helm. They even claimed to have people in the writing room who are Trek fans to tell them what can and can't be done. Utter targ manure.

You have to be in a pretty poor place in a production of Star Trek when you have to recruit Star Trek advisers due to a lack of any fans working on it. Trek needs a fan as show runner, It had one, but then CBS fired Fuller before production began. It's astonishing how so many idiots who know nothing of Star Trek ultimately came together to botch STD when they had everything on the table for the taking. This is particularly poignant example due to CBS shutting down all Star Trek fan fiction longer than 30 minutes in duration in the years during STD's development. It was a tough pill to swallow for CBS to do that when we had a new show on the horizon, but now that it's evident how utterly irredeemable STD is it becomes all the more painful. Like I said, there's no coming back for a franchise with this degree of viterol from the fanbase due to having been held in utter contempt by inexperienced producers and writers who know nothing of the source material.

Now there will be no more Star Trek. Fan fiction has been destroyed under threat of immediate legal action, no fan is going to touch CBS with a barge pole, the movies are now just generic Marvel super hero trash and duly cancelled, and TV trek has been murdered too, and put behind a paywall.

Anything they have missed torching to the ground yet? Oh yes, they shut down an 8 year fan project to make a VR USS Enterprise, and they are in Court over stealing the tardigrades idea from an indie game developer.

I don't know of any franchise that can continue through such catastrophic damage from every possible angle. Now it's just a matter of time while we are all forced to watch CBS kill Picard as the final insult.

No Star Trek is far, far better than bad Star Trek.",27 May 2018
Michael Burnham...the worse Star Trek character ever created....and this is the worse Star Trek that bares ni resemblance to Star Trek,11 October 2020
"Horrible storyline and the constant crying and whining of the main characters is downgrading the series from an original 8 rating to a solid 2. A maximum of 3 to 4 is the best you can expect in season 3 (with a 7 being the passing score on IMDb that's terrible). The directing is terrible with Michael Burnham crying every single episode and acting at an all time low. The best example being characters whispering when making a speech in front of a room filled with audience, none of which would be able to hear a single word. For a supposed officer or even captain all the whining and crying is simply toe curlingly irritating.

The absurdness of spore drive, mycenaeal network and parallel universes are the most irritating attempts to cover all the flaws in the story or the total lack of it. It also enables the writers to jump to bizar parts of the universe without the need for any regards to laws of physics, psychics or any rule whatsoever. Where is the cool pseudo-science, science fact and science fiction from other series? Wiped out by phycological blabla, long boring conversations leading nowhere and adding nothing to the story. Where's the heroism and strength of the officers and crew, none of which would ever have graduated from the Academy and ever have been allowed at the helm, in a captain's chair or responsible for even mopping the floors of a starship.

30% blabla, 30% crying, 20% boredom with zero action and only 20% Star Trek left. One less reason to keep your Netflix account.",5 January 2021

"No original ideas. Dialog such that I wanted to run a drill through my ears. Dark and detail lacking sfx. Casting that would fit more evening TV sitcom than a SciFi show. These main characters lady boys just don't do it for me. Not only unrealistic but also unatractive and with no charisma. At least Uhura had cones that could crush an asteroid :) Postmodern Hollywood ruins another classic. Second season is even worse, with endless emotional dialogs. It's turned for really bad sci-fi to a chick-flick.",25 September 2017
"Ok, so I was quite a big fan of this show for the first season and kept with it as it continued. The cringe level seemed to increase with every episode but in the earlier episodes it did at least have some humour / good storey line to offset those moments.

Some of the characters and actors/actresses give a really good performance

Season 4 however... Its like the main storey line is not the sci fi plot but a character drama. To be honest the amount of time spent going through each characters drama and vitue signalling it didnt even need to be sci-fi.

Awful writing, stopped halfway through season 4, I can't do it anymore.",12 September 2022

"Although the cast is made of really talented people, the script is awfully wrong and is absolutely against fundamentals of Star Trek philosophy. What a big disappointment. Moreover, i have read majority of the reviews here and almost everyone who bothered to write a review on it, says the same. Yet, we hear nothing about these review during After Trek which seems to be a talk show for promotion rather than taking the series seriously and discussing the accuracy, originality, philosophy of the series. So if you wanna watch it, watch it as if it is another Sci Fi series but Not Star Trek",4 February 2018
"When a new Star Trek was announced i was overjoyed.

Would it be like Voyager with newer CGI.. i was so hopeful.

I have seen all the star trek series, DS9 was very trade building but that was the shows identity all along.

Season 1 I did like it took a turn i didn't expect and it was entertaining.

Then I started to notice it was full of political agendas and woke corrections.

Every Season is something different and not in a good way.

It seem more able building the story of the characters exclusively with extraordinarily little else going on in the episodes. Every other Star Trek Series there is character developments but there is a start of something happening with a fantasy story wrapped around it. For a show with Discovery in it, it surely had little of that.

I find myself feeling like i just watched 24 but instead of Jack Bauer it's Michael Burnham. Mixed with Melrose Place in space.

I really hope we don't see a Season 5. I never thought I'd see the day I wished a star trek series would be cancelled but this is so bad.",17 May 2021

Worst writing compounded with terrible acting and directing. How did they get funding for this crap?,16 October 2020
"Highly anticipated, but what a major letdown. The show does not feel 'Star Trek' at all. The camera angle and/or scenes switch every few seconds, to add to the 'excitement' and 'action'. And that is OK when there is something exciting happening, but you cannot do it ALL the time. Also the dialogue is like watching the gilmore girls having a fit. It goes really fast. I could go on and on, but I think you get the gist.

I don't know who made this series, but they definitely have NO knowledge of previous Star Trek series and certainly have made no effort to honor its legacy. I am a life long trekkie, but I am not going to torture myself by watching this.",20 October 2017
"Formulaic TV where every episode is essentially the same which is not a huge issue in and of itself, if it werent for the fact that the formula is so incredibly bad.

1) Nothing ever makes sense, and the people that wrote it thinks your used to not understanding ANYTHING, you have to be pretty buzzed or have IQ issues if you can think about anything in this series for more than half a second without the illusion cracking to pieces. 2) No wonder they picked the dystopian theme, it makes writing so much easier with conflict and drama everywhere, too bad all of it is complete nonsense and people argue for no real reason apart from the trash dystopian setting. 3) There is absolutely no followthrough, Michael disobey's her commanding officer and starts a war against a race because Blingon's are bad and she hates them ? even though she's supposed to be half Vulcan and therefor genetically dispositioned for logic and reason over feelings she does stupid things for stupid reasons every single time but that does drive the plot forward for another 5 stupid minutes. 4) I don't like ANYONE on the show, every single one of them seems somewhat wooden, has less class than the kardashians and less intelligence than a piece of cardboard.

No wonder they never made plans for more than 2 seasons in the same ""timeline"" the plot holes just grow and grow I'm amazed people can stand it for even a single episode.",28 March 2018

Seems like the current writers have taken STAR WARS and built it for the STAR TREK. As a lifelong fan of STAR TREK, way to kill a great franchise that stood for learning and discovery into a quick sci-fi action flick. If we wanted to watch Star Wars, we would watch Star Wars.

"At first I was enjoying Discovery. For a Trek fan, I was really looking forward to watching. I thought the Klingons were great, I enjoyed how the space encounters were presented, there were some great characters and I loved how progressive the show was. But it started to lose me...

I find they are overdoing things. Too many people being altered significantly, too many people coming back from the dead, and too many big monumental moments being crammed into a single season.

I liked the character Tilly at first, but they are overusing her chattiness too much now. And I'm not sure why everyone thinks she is Captain material. The engineer Jett Reno is a wonderful character as long as they don't overdo it with her also.

Another annoyances are some of the sound effects. Like every time the camera would be on Airiam, or when the camera is on a phaser, there is a powering up sound effect. And it gets more intense when the holder of the phaser is getting closer to their target. Annoying to say the least.",28 August 2019
"I think the show would be great if it had not all of this star trek paint on it. If it had it's own little universe to play with a lot of the stuff that happens in the show would be cool.

Star Trek Discovery suffers from all of this: Bad Writing, Ignores and Corrupts Canon, Unlikable Characters, Brutal, Unintelligent, Not family friendly, Every character has big mental issues, Not in the tradition of star trek, Pessimistic, Anti-Star Trek

To sum this up. Star Trek Discovery is an action show with a lot of dumb stuff going on that is made for people that don't know star trek, have a very short attention span, no memory and no interest in science whatsoever.

The gal, meaning no offense, who is playing human but raised Vulcan (Burnham) is so disappointing. She has no presence like Leonard Nimoy or Nichelle Nichols. Her voice is disappointing too. She would be better in a lesser part and replaced with another gal who could deliver. I blame casting. It takes a certain actor to catch attention while in a sci fi series and in particular in a Star Trek series. I believe the fans except so much. It bothers me enough not to continue watching the series or even recommend it to others. The rest of cast seems wonderful so far but I have watched enough series to know that a series lead cannot be held up by rest of cast. Eventually, it suffers.

"I am an elder millennial who isn't clinging on to the ideal vision of GR's TOS and TNG. I loved at least parts if not all of every Trek series leading up to this. DS9 was hands down the best modern adaptation of the original because of its character development and exploration of cultural relevant themes. Discovery lacks the nuance in tackling these issues and the stories are handicapped by the sledgehammering of social justice ideology into the viewers head.

I suffered through the first season's predictable arc and set aside some of the glaring defects in Discovery. After all, DS9 took 3 seasons before it hit full stride and Voyager didn't pick up its pace until the middle of the second season. I know from experience that most Trek shows take a little bit of time to figure out what they want to be. It's usually been the case that the series starts off slow with character development and world building while the writers work under the microscope of network executives until they earn syndication and are allowed some leeway to express their creative vision.

I had high hopes that the mistakes made in season one weren't going to be fatal to this reboot but season two is an absolute disaster. I believe we have crossed the threshold of redemption value but I would love to be proven wrong.

There is nothing compelling me to feel attachment towards any of the caricatures on this show because they all represent a one-sided cookie cutter ideology stemming from the far left of the political spectrum. Part of the problem is the shift in the political landscape in between old school progressive values and new age political correctness. Trek was always a progressive show for its time in each era but the current state of progressive views espoused in discovery is so tribal that it is sure to polarize the viewers.

The moment I gave up on this series was when Pike's crewman tried to ""mansplain"" to Burnam about flying a shuttle and is promptly blown up midsentence. At least I got a good laugh at how hamfisted their message had become. I don't mind watching an episode about supposed ""toxic masculinity"" but how about approaching the topic with a shred of nuance?",27 February 2019

"If you can separate this show from the Star Trek franchise and view it as it's own space drama, It's not bad at all, a solid 5/10. If you can separate this show from the show's producer's political agenda, I'd put it at 6.5/10.

It's more like the recent ""Star Trek"" movies, than any previous Star Trek show. 7 episodes in and we have almost zero character development, just a long story arc centered around one character. It's a cool show, it just isn't Star Trek. If you want a closer Star Trek feel, check out The Orville. It's basically a parody of past trek shows, but it's very fun.

I have not yet given up on this show, but I am very very concerned with how the plot will develop when the producers claim that the Klingons are an allegory to ""White Nationalists"" and ""Make America Great Again"", with the Federation as an allegory to some kind of imperialistic trump resistance political movement. If you watch the show and you are not insane, you won't see this ""allegory"", and If this show devolves into blatant politic propaganda, it will fail very quickly.

Whoever is making your decisions needs to be fired and hire Vic Mignogna as a suitable Roddenberry replacement.

This is not Star Trek, it is Star Cr*p. Let it die.",3 October 2017
"Its a mediocre science fiction based show (I refuse to call this Star Trek). Basically a show tailor-made for a generation that loves movies like The Fast and Furious franchise...Star Trek Enterprise was better than this.

I can't blame the actors,they are just doing their job as best as they can. The people responsible for ruining an opportunity to take Star Trek forward are the Writers - for failing to grasp what Star Trek stands for (very very poor choices made here), the Director - the show is being shot like an ""action movie"" which is definitely not what Star Trek is and completely failing on the background music aspect, the Producers - for approving this and showing complete disregard for star Trek fans. I can't believe no lessons were learnt from the mistakes of Star Trek - Into the Darkness.

Just how did they manage to get it wrong in such a spectacular manner...should have shown some respect for Star Trek and Gene Roddenberry's legacy...",6 November 2017
Why would one create this. It goes against all real Star Trek fans and Star Trek movies. Yes you can make a buck off it this year but who will remember this or make a buck off this crap in 10 years. Sad this happened and the franchise got killed.,15 October 2020
"Not only should the show not carry the moniker Star Trek it should not be a part of the Star Trek franchise in anyway.

Poor writing, overly emotional, characters are not flawed simply unprofessional. With a baseline story that could have been good, kurtzman has ruined this as well as everything else he's touched that Star Trek. Fire him! And get somebody who knows how to write Star Trek in the writing seats.

You waited till Gene Roddenberry died to do this, because he would never have allowed this. It's a disgrace.

Edit; good news it's been canceled. Now if they'd only fire the people involved in upper management.",30 October 2020
"I've been forcing myself to watch this horrific series hoping that just maybe it'll get better or I'll get use to it, but it is truly garbage. It makes no sense in the star trek timeline it claims to be in and it's all about Micheal, who really is not that great of a character. Every episode i watch I'm in agony forcing myself to not break my TV. All i can think is whoever is writing this garbage clearly has never actually watched star trek.

I really want a good new star trek series, but this is definitely not it. I'll keep forcing myself to watch it, just because I apparently like putting myself through pain - and I'm just hoping that maybe it'll become bearable to watch. It made me feel a little better coming online to see that I'm not the only one who sees how horrible this is.

Someone, please cancel this series and make a new one that actually makes sense to the Star Trek series and timeline.",27 December 2020
"You read the comments about how dismal this show is, then look at the episode star ratings (that seem to suggest otherwise), and you realise that the only thing working at this studio is the team of robots manipulating the star ratings on review sites.

I actually abandoned watching this three episodes into season 1, but have been dipping in to see how much worse it could get. They have not disappointed. Every attempt they have made to catch this falling knife cuts deeper.

It isn't all bad. It does make me laugh out loud.

Come to think of it, if you inserted a scene where the bridge crew did a rendition of 'Springtime for Hitler', I doubt anyone would think it was anything but a normal part of the chaotic story.

I'd mention the acting, but even using that word in the sentence flatters.

My hope is that because it is sooo bad, it has already been recognised as an aberration leaving open the hope of rescue.

Maybe Admiral Sulu will drop out of warp in the last episode and phaser them all? It would be a cleaner death than season 3.",13 April 2019
"Another prequel of a prequel of another time period or is it? Uncertain because the series doesn't really know where it wants to go. If you watch the intro ever - which in my opinion is amazing - you can see how many executive producers there are. No wonder it is so messy. Also at the beginning of each episode you get that familiar proud line "" based upon Star Trek created by Gene Roddenberry"" WRONG! The whole concept is totally different. In the classic STs each episode had a different main story and actually the character development arched over the entire series with rotating focus on the main protagonists. After maximum one season you had your favorites and less favorites but all in all you never really hated anybody. Here the stupid story line arches over the series with literally no character development at all. All of them are equally annoying in the exact amount in every episode. That is because they are copy and paste episodes when it comes to structure. In every episode you get Michael to cry Giorgiou to get beaten to mince and survive, The butch lesbian trying to be funny in a seriously dangerous situation, Tilly being an Einstein with a personality of a freshly menstruating teenager, The Captain imitating that dashing smile of Kirk in every situation and Spock has a beard! And this whole repeats in every episode. Yuk! The plot of the series itself it is stolen from Vernor Vinge's A Fire in the Deep which is an amazing hard core space opera. He should sue them. The last episode was a copy of the battle from the beginning of Star Wars Ep 3 the revenge of the Sith. When they deployed the repair droids over Enterprise I vomited. 10 Years before Kirk and they already have holodecks! And lots of other cool technology which is a direct reflection of nowadays. In that Universe apple never existed only Moto Razors. Oh and the series doesn't shy away from hard core science fiction. Parallel universes in which you can travel easily back and forth, Dark matter containers, time travel, traveling through space with a live engine on a layer of living creature which is supposed to be everywhere and gives you instant jump and the best of all replicating the power of a supernova in a half a meter container. That was the best. I laughed out loud. I remember how careful the producers of the older series were when it came to technobable. Here they only technobable and then somebody says ""English please"" like it was funny. And you have that ""let's show men who has bigger balls"" from the #metoo movement gone totally wrong. In this series women are all martial arts experts and they cannot be kicked in the balls. Men are soft and insignificant. The show is fried with CGI and bloody lens flare. The camera movement does those silly ups and downs spins like it was trying to tell you something but no it is just for the looks. The only thing apparently nobody in Hollywood understands about Star trek lately is that Star Trek was never cinematic it was always THEATRICAL! Forget about CGI especially transparent touch screens give us good lines and good acting. But I guess that will never happen anymore because the future has died long time ago. The next ST will probably play in 2051",22 April 2019
"Title should be called ST:Michael because this Mary Sue can do everything and saves the day in almost every episode. I really wanted to give it a chance but I am struggling to finish season 2. Stamets, Saru, Ash and Pike are the best parts of the show. Kill off Michael and Tilly...they drive me up the wall and ruins the show. Unbearable",29 April 2020
"Some good ideas, some good graphics, some good characters, but crying in every episode is just so annoying, they cry when they are happy, they cry when they are sad, they cry when the meet each other, they cry when they leave.

"I was 16 years old when the original Star Trek awakened my dreams of the future, who could look away from a series on TV that was so far ahead of everything that existed, not only on TV, but in the real world as well.... no racism, a world fueled by peaceful relations with the entire universe, A world of exploration with no discrimination between, cultures, gender, race, or species! But STD has replaced all of that with an abomination of collected 21st century political PC jargon, I wanted so much to see Michael become the new Janeway, instead all I see are once intelligent Klingons reduced to ... whatever... Orks? Flash! Dazzel! Jr High School scripts and acting, disjointed story lines with a dash of LGBT thrown in for good measure..., gotta keep the PC crap going. But this is not Star Trek, and it's an insult to the original creators, writers, producers, actors, and audience. I forced myself through the 1st few episodes hoping they would finally reach watchability. they never did, in fact I ordered the CBS streaming app just to have his show available. I've cancelled both, but fortunately I have the complete collections of all of the previous Star Trek series, and am content to re-watch them over, and over, and over until something better comes along, all of the previous Star Trek series, and movies, oh yeah and also SG-1. Please cancel this show before any more damage can be done to the memory of Gene Rodenberry and Star Trek!",14 March 2019

"I was really excited, the first season... hm ok... something new, finally a good sci fi show (good i mean the cgi etc) but than.... what is the story... what what .... getting more and more boring, the parallel thingy... what ... ok so the bad a%% b!tches wear black latex costumes and have fany drag makeup 🤣😂🤣 and that's it... i am forcing myself to finish the 3rd season (yep i am still watching... since netflix also is getting more and more boring with less and less watchable shows) ... i will make it to the end, but wished i had not started in the first time... really boring, co fusing and with no poi t... oh btw. Nothing to do with Star Trek... it's just some new sci fi show.",21 December 2020
"Started off great. Good actors and a different spin on Star Trek. I really liked the first few seasons. Then it went downhill. I don't know what happened......they either lost their writers or they lost their way. It transitioned into a show that spends most of its time talking about feelings. Let's face it, those of us that like Star Trek are looking for some sci-fi action wrapped up in an intelligent story. And that's how Discovery started and then it transitioned into the Oprah show set in outer space. Nothing against Oprah, she's great.....it's just not what you are looking for when you tune into Star Trek. I haven't given up on it yet. I hope they turn it around but if they continue down the same path I don't think I can make it through another season.",17 April 2022
"Like so many others who have written of their disappointment I too suffered through a few episodes of season one and then gave up - quite simply Discovery is not Star Trek. Season one was just an attempt on the part of the studios to leverage $$$ from the Star Trek brand without bothering to actually produce a Star Trek show. Recently I watched a trailer for one of the S2 episodes and it seemed better so I tried again. I watched the end of S1 for context and began S2. While not perfect it was better for a time if you accept the gibberish pseudo-science, ridiculously poor decisions by officers and over-emphasis on Burnham character. However by S2 E11 it's fully back to rubbish. If these are meant to be the best of us then we are all in serious trouble. The biggest sin in screen writing is thinking that creating conflict through the stupidity of your characters is acceptable. It's not, it's just sloppy writing and pathetic just as your characters have become. Every sentient life in the universe hangs in the balance and instead of focusing on the enemy our main characters are having a heart to heart with dear mommy... What a joke. I'll try one more episode but pretty sure the plot is going right back to another war which is the ultimate deal breaker for me. Star Trek is NOT about war and blasting bad guys, it was so much more than that and now it's rot.",29 August 2019
"A bit hard to follow, what with all the species, accents and background noise. No attempt to establish characters. Things happen fast, and not believably so. The show would have to be pretty good to justify paying a subscription fee to continue. It was not that good. CBS has made a grave error to think this pilot can carry their subscription channel. It will fail there and return to known space, or die in the void.",24 September 2017
"Phew; Just when I thought there was a franchise that that I could watch without fear of having the f-word dropped into a kids programme, these guys saved the day.

I swear like a trooper. I bet my daughter hears all sorts of swear words at school.

I don't, however, expect to have to watch out for it in a ****ing Star Trek spin off I'm watching in my living room.",23 October 2017
"That's all the main character seems to do. Seriously. You'd hope this amount of melodrama would be against starfleet regulations.

It's a bit conflicting because there are some really good Star Trek elements. The storyline wasn't bad, and most of the acting is good (when they're not busy crying all the time).

I mean, they should design the uniforms to have a built-in tissue paper dispensers. You'd think they would have factored in the inefficiency (and unsightliness) of having tears and mucus running down your face.

So anyway. The production value is good. It's probably the best looking Trek we've had- If that matters. It won't save us from the generally weak characters though... and all the crying.

All that said. I find myself watching it anyway and just fast forwarding all the crying. Which cuts viewing time to a more manageable five minutes. That's a positive I think.

Oh. My favorite cameo from the last JJ Trek movies did make it into this. Lens flair! I missed you Lens Flair. Wondered when you'd come back.

Okay. I guess this show isn't that bad. I gave it five stars. Mainly cause I love Star Trek and it reminds me at times of ST:TNG. So I guess I'll keep watching... and fast forwarding.",7 May 2019
"It's politically correct not ambitious. It also has the worst representation of the Klingons we've seen to date. Whilst it tries to have strong female leads they call the main character, a female, Michael. It's excruciating in parts. As a Star Trek fan I hate it. As a Sci-Fi fan I hate it. As someone who likes great TV shows of many genres I find it preachy. It's not genuine and just kind of sickly.",16 October 2020
"... and in this case it's called The Orville.

Honestly, I've been a huge fan of Star Trek franchise and I never had a problem with watching any of the Star Trek before, until Discovery.

I am finding my self not being able to watch any of those episodes in one go. It is not possible! This just does not feel like a Star Trek at all, but it feels like an insult to all of us who fell in love with Voyager, DS9, TOS, or Enterprise.

The only group of people who will enjoy this abomination are the Social Justice Warriors, crazy and feeble minded as they are, they might find this entertaining. But for the rest of us true Trekkie's, this is hell.

The Orville series is more Star Trek then this thing will ever be.

Shame on You people who made this awful pathetic excuse for our beloved TV Show happen.",13 November 2017
"If you don't care about the special effects but the plot you will be disappointed, I watched Next Generations over 20 years ago (roughly) and I still remember scenes and episodes, I doubt I will remember Discovery in 3 years.

"Why does every episode have very angry characters? Quote: Hurry, we're running out of time, but, spend three minutes casting dramatic glances. Too much drama, should be called Star Trek, the angst. How did these characters even graduate the Starfleet Academy? I wonder how they did on the Kobayashi Maru test. Did they Cry them to safety? Too much CG and not enough story. Visual overload.

Sorry, just had to update, this series just gets worse with every episode. Now we know humanity's future...overly emotional, angsty, and politically correct. Maybe they should all get in a hot tub and ""bear their feelings"". Utter rubbish.",18 December 2020
First able this us not a Star Trek Show! Second the show is very sexist! Third this doest deserve to be part of the Star Trek canon,5 December 2019
"Some people on here say it's not Star Trek. It is Star Trek actually. It has Star Trek ships, Star Trek insignias and even familiar names and characters. So it is Star Trek, it just doesn't have the soul of previous iterations. It's weird because I like some episodes, a lot! But then there are also episodes that I can't stand which happens more and more after the first episode of season 3, the show almost goes backwards somehow.

I do agree with a lot of reviews about the main character, sometimes i do like her and sometimes I can't stand her. I really miss the style of other Star treks, it would focus on a different character here and there, maybe data one episode, maybe Riker in another but all you get is Michael, all the time! It's too much, I don't like her enough to want her to be the focus every episode. There's a ship full of people and we barely know them deep down like we know the main character. When I say it's lost the soul, I also mean the exploration aspect. It was always cool not knowing where they might end up next, what planet they may explore, what new species they will find. It's ironic that the ship is called Discovery but they don't discover anything new (except the future) I guess?

As a huge TNG, deep space nice and Voyager fan, it definitely does not feel like the Star Trek of old, if you want that then check out the Orville. If you are more of a fan of the Star Trek reboots then this might be more your taste.",14 December 2020

"There are no spoilers in this review because there is no plot in this show to ""spoil.""

""Dreck"" is the German word for ""dirt,"" ""filth,"" ""muck,"" etc. Thus, I would suggest to the producers of STD that they rename their show ""Star Dreck: Discovery."" Doing so would at least represent a faithful adherence to Truth in Advertising. To call this show Star Trek: (anything) is a disservice to its viewers, and an insult to the memory of the great visionary Gene Roddenberry. Not only does STD break from the Star Trek universe in virtually every way possible (an act that in itself constitutes a sin for -any- supposed prequel of an established story line), it doesn't even have the excuse of improving the story when it does so. So we're left with a show that stoops to invoking the honored Star Trek franchise name in order to peddle a product that is poorly written, poorly acted, poorly directed, and quite frankly, boring and vapid.

The story is unbelievable as sarek never raised any girl it doesn't track with any star trek in history you can't just make up stuff and claim it is based on gene Roddenberry yet not make the stories make sense with future and past star treks. And this is suppose to be 10 years before Kirk? Then how is there cloaked ships?!! In star trek the series Kirk runs into the test ship the first of it's kind that the Klingon's were testing that had cloak ability yet magically in this new spin off magically they existed 10 years before Kirk? RIDICULOUS, Everything about this story in the first 2 episodes makes the series unwatchable if your a long time star trek fan and know the back story of the actors in it this show makes no sense what so ever, Not to mention nobody is going to pay for counterfeit broadcasting stations ( cbs ) app to continue watching it, I hope it fails and is canceled but maybe all the snowflakes will keep watching, But i think any long time star trek fan will agree it fails as a added saga right out of the gate.",25 September 2017
"I mean they went all Stargate Universe with this one, changed everything that made star trek what is was.

they changed the episodic format. they took away the spirit and brightness. they made the klingons look and act ridiculous. there is no depth, and no lovable characters. and even though this is supposed to be before kirk they have technology that even voyager wouldn't have. they replaced the star trek fasers with starwars style canons. the list goes on and on forever.

i mean its just not star trek, and you should not believe the critics score on this one.

they should have learned from universes failure that doing this to a long running franchise does not work, and is likely to kill it. I cant even force myself to watch the new episodes, my soul wont let me.

i would not be surprised if this was canceled after a season or 2 just like universe, and frankly it should be.",7 January 2018
"Star Trek Discover is a bit like being on a bad Tinder date. There was potential but it goes horribly wrong and you feel scammed out of life.

This is a laser show for kids. And people are wrong when they compare this with Star Wars. It's an insult for the later. At least SW was the first of it's kind. I hope this mindless space shooting will be last of it's kind in the Star Trek universe. Let the black holes be with you!",30 September 2017
"I'm giving this two stars mostly because I liked the special effects. Beyond that I must admit that I was left disappointed. For somebody new who has never seen Star Trek before, this is a good sci-fi show. For somebody loyal to the franchise however it misses the mark by a fair margin, at least so far. It feels like a dark version of the series we all love.

Firstly, it's supposed to take place 10 years before Captain Kirk but uses technology far too advanced to be believable or in keeping with the time line. The Klingons were confusing at best. I spent most of my time reading sub-titles.

Star Trek is supposed to be about discovery and exploration and this is the first series that takes you away from that. It's far too defense and battle orientated with all the special effects that go with it. The characters have yet to evolve I will admit but the Captain and First Officer are so far completely void of personality. The Science Officer looks like he may evolve into an interesting character but I must confess to being reminded of C3PO without the aluminum suit. Contrast this to other Star Trek series where the characters showed interesting personalities from episode 1.

All in all this reminds me more of Star Wars than Star Trek. Not sure how much further I will watch. Hoping for improvements.",2 October 2017

"The trouble with every new Star Trek series is forgetting the foundation, ""...seek out new life and new civilizations."" That's what made the original so good. Klingons and Vulcans have worn out their welcome, so please stop. Making matters worse, with the exception of Sonequa Martin-Green, the casting is really bad. None of the key characters are interesting or memorable so even the soap opera stories on the ship are a yawn.

"I've been a Star Trek fan all of my life and I've seen every movie and show of every series multiple times. Star Trek series have not always been good from the start and they would gradually get into their groove. Enterprise is the perfect example of that. It really was the worst of the series being too clean and less cowboy than it should have been, but it got better in the 3rd season. But all the series had a framework of which to work with and a recipe for success. This show ignores all of that framework and blatantly shoves it in your face. The show goes out of its way to be diverse by ridding itself of as many white people as it can. Its main character is a female with a male name, an openly gay couple on the ship, and the writers went out of their way to make the Klingons an allegory to Trump voters. The show goes out of its way to shove a viewpoint in your face, making it not about the story, but the ideology with a Star Trek face to it. Now I know Star Trek has never dodged the issues and I'm not saying it should, but the show really takes it too far by taking a stand and planting its flag forcing the viewer to be on one side or the other therefor alienating half of the audience. Star Trek represented the issues before, but without alienating the audience. The writers should have stuck with that formula.

That's it, isn't it for CBS? They don't care about the vision and the legacy of Mr. Roddenberry, the standards and the parameters set by the previous beloved, iconic shows. They just wanted the movie crowd from the stupid ""abramsverse"" to come on board and click subscribe on their absurd ""all access"" service.

This is not a show made for us lifelong Star Trek fans. It is nothing but a ""GoTesque"" spin of a space action series. While Star Trek was a space opera, Discovery is a half-witted attempt to copy what other shows are about, while trying to profit on their popularity. I can clearly see now greedy people in suits sat one day in one of those fancy board rooms and said: How about we make Game of Thrones in space, with the J.J Abrams lens flares and the violence of The Walking Dead? Wouldn't that be wonderful?

You can see that in the first 30 minutes of the show when Burnham urges the captain to attack the Klingons. Can you imagine any of the previous Starship Captains using violence as the first resort? As you can see the Star Trek history, legacy and everything we love is shattered in the first half hour of the show along with the prime directive.

Don't get me started on the ""dark"" visuals of the whole show? How is that in line with the hope for all humanity and the bright future of our civilization as the backbone of Mr. Roddenberry's vision? The atmosphere is so dark and the camera angles are so weird that even after two episodes we don't know how the bridge actually looks like on the new (old) ships.

Then, the writing comes along. It is so dull, uninspiring and bad that it can surely fit a high school sci-fi story of the month contest. Everything has to be explained to the viewer with lines like ""you've served under me for seven years,"" or ""they said ""hello"" in a language the Klingons understood"". So the idea is to treat us – the viewers like brainless, popcorn eating zombies who can't figure things out for themselves. What a disgrace and insult to our intelligence because Star Trek used to be a show for people who sought meaning in things. For people who wanted to reevaluate their moral compasses, their views and to be challenged with new ideas and concepts. Perceptions brilliantly presented to us through meaningful writing and awesome characters inhabited by actors who knew what the show was about.

To sum it up:

This show has nothing, ZERO of the vibe, the standards and the parameters set by Mr. Roddenbery back in 1966. They (the execs and the suits) never cared about the message and the idea as the core of the Star Trek vision, nor did they care for the lifelong appreciation and the support of the franchise by us – the fans.

The soul of Star Trek is now lost in the depths of messy mixture of greed, conformity and lack of vision and I don't know if it ever will be ""discovered"" again (although I still hope).",1 October 2017
"After 15 minutes I was already playing with my phone, then suddenly the first episode ended and I forced myself to watch the second one: still boring, begins with a lot of unmotivated humor, the plot is super linear, 50% of time they speak a strange kind of klingon, Klingons looks like hogs, Klingons one more time described as dumb and weak (the fight with the batleths is hilarious), nonsense, non sequiturs. You will like it only if you loved Jar Jar Binks. But still watch it, come back and cast your vote: the world must know!",25 September 2017
"Despite the 7.4 rating, nearly 2/3rds of the reviews are 1/10.

Attempting to watch this show made me nauseous. Calling this ""Star Trek"" is entirely misleading and wrong, even by reboot standards. I think I watched 6 episodes originally before giving up and now I couldn't get past episode 2.

What really made me sick was how this show seems to be a sign of the times in entertainment where constant sensory overload is spun as a story. Maybe I just got a headache from having to constantly read the Klingon subtitles.

The show also completely throws out any ethical dilemmas from the original series, and assumes just because the Federation had enemies (Romulans, Klingons, etc) that it's ok to exploit that in this series as the focus (ie war). Star Trek was never about war or fighting. Even when things got bad with the bad guys, there was a moral undertone. The good guys (Starfleet) never did the wrong thing by striking first, etc. Ethics was the foundation of Star Trek. Even the Klingons, Romulans, etc for the most part were very cautious about starting a war. And when a mistake was made that aggravated the enemy, there was always remorse. Where did that morality go?

What's really disturbing about this show is that it's a definite sign of the times with our country and how we feel the need to screw around the world and kill countless innocent people, all in the name of ""protecting our freedoms"". Perhaps this show is an attempt at brainwashing us to think that how we behave in the larger world is acceptable or necessary. It's essentially a justification of modern politics and toxic masculinity.

I miss Star Trek TOS, TNG, and even Voyager. Watching them actually brings me comfort and hope. Everybody was likable, even if they weren't perfect. They were all essentially good people. Captain Picard was a genuine model of mature masculinity and leadership. He was just, merciful, wise and compassionate. He was not at all impulsive, egotistical, narcissistic or power hungry. Neither was Commander Riker or Chakotay. Even the Maquis storyline in Voyager was met with the morality of ""doing the right thing"" and putting those politics aside for the sake of getting home (those who acted selfishly and against the Starfleet crew were clearly viewed as bad people). Not this toxic masculine nonsense that Discovery is trying to justify, where everybody is neurotic, impulsive, hateful, judgmental, self-serving, etc. I find it ironic that some people were complaining how politically correct the show is, when I see the exact opposite.

Why were we bothering to engage with the Klingons at the edge of Federation space? Who says this far edge of space is Federation? What the heck does it matter? Why is it worth fighting for? How do you justify sending your first officer deep into space in a suit, rather than a shuttle craft that could actually get away from the enemy? Why fight that initial Klingon in space, rather than just try to get away without anyone getting hurt? And why have the entire ship stand it's ground at that edge of Federation space, after one of the Klingons were killed? Is publicly announcing ""We come in peace"" the smart thing to do after accidentally killing one of the Klingons (I feel like Picard or Janeway would have done their best to avoid a war)? Are the ideas of peacemaking just totally out the window? And how the heck did a fleet of Starfleet ships come to the rescue at the edge of Federation territory so quickly? I feel like even in TNG that the Enterprise would have had the smarts to handle a diplomatic approach because help would almost always be days away, rather than minutes/hours. The idea of creating peace (respect) through fighting war is completely absurd, even for a warrior race like the Klingons! It's such a horrible idea that it feels sickening that there are producers and writers out there trying to pass this off as fantasy of our potential future.

What ever happened with the Star Trek ideal of a better future, our potential humanity? Of exploring our political/social dilemmas through the analogy of space travel? It just seems like we're no longer concerned in entertainment this day with being better people and just about satisfying our basest impulses, with no regard for what's right or wrong.

This show shouldn't be called Star Trek at all.",29 March 2019
"The bad signs were all there. The first news foreshadowed an endless amount of PC tokenism and SJW mentality, all of which sadly came true. It's not like ST was always devoid of liberal bias but Discovery brings these problems to a whole new level.

The main cast is so multi-ethnic now that it makes all those Benetton campaigns look homogeneous in comparison. Also it does not help that the Asian Michelle Yeoh's character has a Romanian name (Georgiou) for some mysterious reason. You know diversity is our strength even if it makes everyone on the federation side of the story rootless.

The klingons on the other hand seem like a well organized folk that has a vision of itself and the determination to preserve its values. The scripts desperately tries to position them as the deplorable (wink,wink) villains but accidentally they also managed to make them look more sympathetic than any of the human/navii/mix-raced/whatever protagonists.

I guess since diversity is the new official religion of the western world all forms of kinship and tribalism has to be portrayed as backwards and – you guessed it – racist. For the above reasons I root for the klingons. I hope that they will be able to preserve their superior culture and that they will be able to drive those diverse SJW clowns out of the galaxy.

I'm not sure I will get to see it though as I have zero interest in the rest of the show. You see I'm already fed up with emancipated female warriors and I'm not sure I want to see same-sex marriages and transgender toilets on federation ships. Also I want my new Klingon show with badass Klingon knights saving the damsel in distress. Hopefully the Russians will produce something similar. Until then you can find me on the Duck Dynasty forum.",25 September 2017
"I wanted to like this, but I found it lacking. What I did not feel was the comradely, the spirit of unity of team-ship,; e.g., friendship, sharing as a community or family. The right stuff that keeps each other upbeat despite the difficulty of their circumstances. IMO, this was not overt as it's predecessors.

Perhaps it will pickup in time, but, it better be soon to keep my interest.

"STOP RUINING STAR TREK!!!

Star Trek for those of you who actually watched it (and I mean the proper series) is a series of exportation. Mankind has solved all their issues and is out to explore the universe and see what is out there. It's meant to be a story of overcoming obstacles more by diplomacy and ingenuity. All this series does is show that we have not changed and never will. We don't care about that inner curiosity and care more about war and conquest.

A massive let down. This is exactly what Gene Roddenberry hated. You have turned a masterpiece into utter garbage. Only thing worth even one star is that is has Star Trek as the title, and with you ruining the brand this much I don't know how long that will last.",21 November 2020

If only it did not revolve around Michael. This character had to do everything and no one could! Give me a break. It should have been named Star Trek: Michael Burnham. It's a lost chance. Could have been so much better.,20 April 2019
Somewhere there's a richter scale going off the charts as Gene Roddenberry spins in his grave. This is NOT 'Star Trek'. This cheap cash grab does everything in it's power to ruin and bastardize this beloved franchise. But hey... at least we have 'The Orville'. :),30 September 2018
"It has lost almost any connection to concept and aesthetics of Star Trek. The Characters are the worst. And it's not the actors, they are great and doing a great job. But this is a disgrace to Star Trek. I envy the Star Wars fans for Madalorian, they stayed true to their main aesthetics and conecpts and created something new and beautiful. Discovery is as different genre of scifi than Star Trek.",9 December 2020
"I just finished watching episode 3 of Star Trek: Discovery and I feel like I can now say what I think of it. Before I get into my rant let me give credit where credit is due; the acting is phenomenal Sonequa Martin-Green does a fantastic job, Doug Jones is great as Saru and everyone else plays their role beautifully. The graphics are also great (but I really don't feel like that's worth anything anymore seeing as everything is CGI'ed to hell and at this point it's expected). Beyond that; I honestly could not be more angry with how they have taken Star Trek and ruined it. Super intense action, constant tension and suspense has never been what Star Trek is about. They have turned what once was a series that focused on character development, relationships and philosophical and moral questions into a run and gun thriller. Star Trek is not the series for high octane action sequences and space battles, that's what we watch Star WARS for. Some of the best episodes of Star Trek were nothing but talking; Measure of a Man in TNG is a great example of this. Please anyone who is currently watching Star Trek: Discovery please go back and watch that episode, or any episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation for that matter and you will see how far removed this new series is from what Star Trek is supposed to be. Look if you had made this show as simply a new space series and kept the Star Trek brand off of it I probably would have said ""Hey this is a really good Sci-Fi show with some phenomenal acting and you should check it out"" but as a Star Trek show it is appalling.",4 October 2017
"I painfully watched every episode. The Michael Burnam character is a boring, openly insubordinate crybaby. While the Klingon outfits are interesting, how will they fit into other Star Trek stories? The long, giant subtitled Klingon scenes in the first season are painful at best, sickening at worst. Boring is the recurring theme. Discovery never discovers anything of note. Alternative universes, time travel that solves nothing and cringeworthy characters like Reno and Stamets bouncing insults off each other make it, should I say again, boring? The Bourne Identity style of changing the camera angle every 1.7 seconds, and the constant sparks raining down from unknown places like a 20th century battleship or something fill me with an unnamed dread. No there is a name: BORING. Saru is an OK character. Nothing tries in to itself. I want this to go away. Please end it now and try to make amends.",12 March 2021
"I admit it's a review based on one episode - the only one available now - but if the whole series is based on these premises I won't be watching it. The whole plot - without any spoilers - is based on one and only concept: war. There's no exploration, no Federation prime directive, no wits, no philosophy, it's not even a commentary on how our society can grow into something better. there is literally NOTHING left of what made Star Trek great and so beloved by the fans.

The show portrays one concept and one concept only - which was a concept that the previous shows used in a very careful way: war. The dialogues are cringe-worthy, the characters uninspired so far and absolutely out of place.

The visual effects are probably the only thing to be saved from this disaster, but they're not enough to save it from boredom and still one step under the aesthetic pleasure of The Expanse.",25 September 2017
"What the hell CBS? You've ruined 50 years of TV in a stroke. What are we supposed to do now? Just pretend this didn't happen? You've done a cash grab on a classic and tried to milk it like Marvel. The end result is by far the worst abuse of Star Trek ever IP by a lightyear, and I'm including the reboot movies in that. How dare you? You realise this is completely unrecoverable?

The boycott is on you greedy SOB's. I feel sorry for the careers of the actor's you strung in to this on the promise of it being the next best thing.

Let's be very clear here, this IS NOT Star Trek, it's not even close to parody of it, it's the result of idiots who have a vague idea of what Star Trek is, and then set out to desecrate it with shallow writing, generic acting, and 2004 style CGI. I shall never source past content through official channels again. You've killed your biggest fanbase a year after it's 50th anniversary.

This will go down in history as yet another example of trying to rewrite a classic with disastrous consequences.",18 December 2017
"What was CBS thinking when they decided to launch this thing? I don't know how much they spent, supposedly a lot, but it's just wrong in so many ways. The Klingons look ridiculous, their ships do too. The First Officer acts like she's on meth or crack, and the Captain is dull, to be nice about it. To me, it just looks cheap in some ways, the Klingon ships, etc, and very high budget, the costuming. How this being set 10 years before Kirk and Spock is something I guess I'll never understand, or accept. Something so simple as the Klingon ships looking totally different than the old show is a mistake that should never have been made. Just like this show.",24 September 2017

"The mantra of Star Trek ""To Boldly Go Where Nobody Has Gone Before"" is something that Star Trek Discovery really doesn't believe in and quite frankly takes great pains to remove from the franchise. The original set up of Discovery was a prequel were they couldn't visit strange new worlds because they could only visit places the franchise has already visited and now in a jump to the 31st century they exist in a world where the federation has explored the galaxy and knows all the inhabitants of the galaxy (it had even mastered time). Discovery can't truly visit new civilisations or worlds because they have been discovered.

This lack of imagination also bleeds into the approach to story telling of the season where the writing is ""going where plenty of people have gone before"" where an generic post-apocalyptic universe has been inserted into the galaxy. This has fundamentally changed the franchise from Science Fiction to Fantasy and sacrificed any originality which the franchise could pride itself on in the 60s-90s iterations. A trailblazer franchise is now a generic and quite boring world.

Poor world building of this dystopia also makes the universe blander and uninteresting. The writers have quite clearly applied their generic universe and utilised a singular plot device to explain it. With this In place the writers have not felt the need to explain the universe adequately utilising the ""because of the burn"" excuse for everything we see. What we have now is a starfleet that didn't really change much from the 24th century after 800 years, which doesn't really make much sense considering where we were back in the 12th century compared with today. The future isn't even a ""strange new world"" to explore instead its an ""all too familiar world"".

Star Trek Discovery sacrifices exploration, science and a well constructed universe in favour of quick explanations, melodrama and fantasy. The lazy writing has taken an intricate universe and made it a bland carbon copy of other franchises. Gone are the days of complex story telling and now we get a new era of bland, simple Star Trek.",17 January 2021
I am so disappointed. This show is so bad that I think they should cancel it. It is NOT star trek and a total failure. Boring and very arrogant.,20 January 2019
Sonequa Martin-Green is a mediocre actress at best and should'nt have the lead role. Ruined the series!,2 January 2021
"I've gotten over Star Wars. And now I think Im over Star Trek. I liked the idea of single episodes rather than a continuing saga with all its drudgery. (Stories by committee downgraded to a long story by a committee.) I miss ensign Roe, I miss Tasha Yar, and yes , I miss the first dingy episode of Commander Pike and an halicuinatory prison. Take some chances people my god , take some chances. No fair taking chances by committee The story is everything people, even if its cheap, dirty , and wrong. I don't care what you budget is .",22 March 2021
"The first couple of series aren't bad, but it progressively gets more ridiculous. It's less star trek and more space fantasy.

The pace is very fast, hindering character development and intrigue. They've gone out of their way to make everything cool for the sake of being cool.

Technology-wise they have painted themselves into a corner. The power curve is ridiculous, and I have no idea how they are going to rectify it.

Ultimately this isn't a very star trek series. It's a fast-paced, colourful, fantasy action series aimed at a young audience.

There is a lot of crying and talking about feelings. I would guess that the last season was 30% weeping.",23 July 2023
"The cast is great, the writing is horrible. I quit watching this season because I just couldn't take it anymore. I am a huge ST fan and have re-watched every season of every series during the pandemic and I just can't watch this series any longer. It plays out more like a CW teen series with every opportunity used to show someone crying, ugh. If you are a true trek fan prepare to be horrified but what they've done here.",27 December 2020
"First 2 seasons were great.

Third season was adequate.

Fourth season feels like one ""very special episode"" after another.

What a waste... I have nothing against character development, but, come on. Now even the computer is having a nervous breakdown?! When did it become sentient anyway??

I love star trek and simply cannot watch this drivel anymore.",19 April 2022
"I wanted to give season two a chance to redeem itself, but it does not. All of the issues with the first season persist. The performances are weak to middling. The dialogue is clumsy and heavily steeped in 20th century phrases/idioms... why?! Seriously, why?! The impotent acting and amateurish script prevent the story from taking off. However, if Discovery was created for the stupids and the gullibles, then well done!

Kurtzman and Fuller - the creators and head writers - are failing the series, but they are getting a lot of use out of ""20th Century Phrases & Idioms for Dummies.""",17 February 2019
"Terrible dialogue, heavy handed script, nauseating characters... eff this...

At no point in time did this feel like Star Trek. Having watched the whole season, I wish I could take the damn blue pill and wake up in a world without this show. Michael is not believable as someone who was raised in the Vulcan culture. Such an amazing plot idea gone to waste (just like the entire show!)

The script writers need someone to quote Billy Madison to them: ""...what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.""

"This empty shell is painted like a rainbow but empty of anything Star Trek. They pushed their diversity crap into this farce and stuck a Star Trek sticker on it hoping it would help spread their propaganda.

I like diversity, natural diversity, but when it's obvious the only reason you got that position is because of your gender, skins color or sexual orientation then you are a nuisance and not an asset.

They completely ignored all that is Star Trek and went for look instead of content. You have characters not behaving as Federation officers would, Klingon that look ridiculous, an armed Klingon warrior not able to beat a frail unarmed woman and ridiculous disregard of simple physics in space.

This is a space show for low IQ PC kissers looking for lots of lens flare, no content and big explosions in space.

Any fan of Star Trek do yourself a favor and clear of this total garbage.",30 September 2017
This is a very unusual tv series compared with other Star Trek. They have inserted a lot of wokeness and socialism. I keep continue watching just because is Star Trek but in reality it does not represent the real story of how people working for a federation that is for for the advancement of all races is feasible for the reality that is Star Trek. All other Star Trek maintain the normal format of it.,14 May 2022
"This series focuses around a single main character ""Michael"" (a woman) traditionally Star Trek incorporates multiple lead roles contributing to a cohesive and well balanced show run. Aside from a boy named Sue, the show has redeeming qualities. The writing is on par from what Trekkies would expect from a modern Star Trek series. When it comes to the acting... well, there are some obvious shortcomings. Martin-Green aka Michael was a bold choice to anchor the show. Her chops come across as soap opera esque and lacks the conviction it takes to portray a believable Federation Officer. The shows saving grace is its noble first officer Saru, brilliantly portrayed by Doug Jones in the true style Star Trek demands. Cameo roles such as Pike and various villains add just enough quality and talent to keep you watching.

The first season is wonderful. I was thoroughly surprised with how much I liked it. The second however went horribly off the rails. This is also where the acting issues were exacerbated. Maybe it was the directing and/or editing. I've just started season 3 and so far it's seems to be tightening up with no help from ""Michael"" this character is still underperforming. Too dramatic, too emotional, with a completely inappropriate diva flare that just wears thin immediately. My hope is that they diversify and run the show more in line with The Next Generation. Build multiple leads and storylines to follow instead of this very linear and single goal/outcome approach. I have high hopes for this series because I'm such a Star Trek fan. Hopefully they'll kill off this ""Michael"" character or at least send her to some acting classes. It's definitely worth watching but needs improvement. Anyway I think this horse is dead. Fire Martin-Green that is all.",24 October 2020
"If that's the future of humanity, I wish good luck to the Klingons!",18 January 2019
Top notch CGI but this show constantly gives the impression that they don't know what they're doing nor where they're the going. It's almost like the producers are trying to cram this garbage down mour throats and saying you're going to watch this whether you like it or not and I do not like it.,5 June 2022
"To be succinct, the problems with this whole show seem to boil down to a few key elements. Namely, Michael Burnham is inconsistently written, e.g. raised as an emotionless vulcan (which they emphasised in the first few episodes) but always emotional and making emotional decisions. She is uninteresting and her drives and motives aren't consistent.

Also the whole Sarek/Spoke connection is very weak. It's poor writing at to try and shoe horn her into the canon storyline. Instead of adding depth to the character it jisy makes the whole thing feel forced. I hoped they would ignore this, however for some reason this seems to be the whole plot of season 2.

This show has some moments that are ok and the visuals are incredible. But it you want a successor to TNG/DS9 go watch the orville.",28 January 2019
"The best thing to say about this show is that it is politically correct. Apart from that it is a soap opera. Plenty of tears and distressed heroines. I am a trekkie as long as I can think without glorifying it beyond reason: there was a lot of cheaply produced stuff in all installments. But there were real highlights as well and moving storylines. This has nothing of all that: the production values are outstanding, everything is perfect. The only thing it does not have is a story you could relate to once you are past 14, and characters you could feel with. What you get instead: Mary Ingalls from Little house in the prairy in outer space. Waste of time. Watch Picard instead. That is Trek.",1 March 2023
"It's a good time to think about what made the original series so enduring and to reflect on just what has gone wrong with this show.

As others have said, this isn't Star Trek. Amongst the qualities it lacks are the philosophy and social progressiveness of Gene Roddenberry - not that but also the interpersonal relationships, particularly between Spock & McCoy. None of that to be found here!

It's true to say that not all of the original Trek's stories are particularly good but it was still worth watching even on it's worst episodes. Time to reflect on why.",18 October 2017

"I think what hurts this show is the name Star Trek. In all honesty, the plots aren't that bad. The science fiction is interesting and the visuals are good. Acting is meh, but whatever I guess.

The problem is that this isn't Star Trek. It feels like a whole other universe. I'm supposed to believe that this series takes place 10 years before TOS? It's not funny, it's not uplifting, and it's not wholesome. It's dark and intense. Like the JJ Abrams films except without the good characters.

They will regret going in a different direction than the standard Star Trek shows. I think this show would have done well if it was unattached from the Star Trek universe.",14 May 2019
"A far cry from season 1, and even worse than season 2, S3 has become a testament to how bad writing and narrative construction can nose-dive a show.

From Burnham taking the center-stage at every damn moment and becoming the wonder woman of the show, to the thinly veiled reasons for the ship going from point A to point B without any actual narrative development. From Book's role on the show being relegated to hero a day, to the Burn finally being explained, and it is a dreadful disappointment.

We are in season 3, and there is still no real development going on with the characters. The most amusement I've had so far was making fun of helmsman Oh-Oh, and that is just an example of how bad things are on the show. It's as if the writers are not even bothering.

The writers are using the franchise to push forward their own agendas and trying to be bold with the representation on the show.

Somewhere along the way amidst the fast paced mumbo-jumbo pseudo-science claptrap, they've forgotten to write a plot.

I'm pretty sure they are making it up as they go along.",25 December 2020

"As someone who loves star trek this was a slap on the face. Not because its new and innovative. But because of the utterly painful dialogues in this show. For some reason the director tries to make every conversation in the show some deep profound heart felt dialogue. And it fails 10/10 times. Nobody cares about burnhams feelings, nobody cares about the gay black doctor. The entire crew is very unlikeable Tilly in particular.

Star trek have always been very story focus, but this Star Trek suddenly became so character focused. It takes way too much focus in the characters emotional states, than actual showing cool Sci fi stfuff. That being said when the show actually does focus on the story we do see some cool sci fi. The bad sadly outweighs the good though. Ironic that The orville is a better star trek than an actual star trek series.",10 December 2019
"This really feels like the same misstep that killed off Stargate as a franchise. The same way Stargate:Universe tried to shoehorn the then successful BSG feel into a completely inappropriate Stargate universe, this seems to be fitting the ""dark and mature"" Game of Thrones/BSG/etc universe into Star Trek, which is an equally bad fit. Both Stargate and Star Trek, for all their differences, were centered largely on a relatively cheerful, optimistic, ""sense of wonder"" genre, while BSG and others centered more on the distopian, grim future genre. The two do not mix well. Nor is it just a matter of tone, the first generally has a more episodic, adventure centered format, while the later tends to favor drawn out story arcs and large, epic story lines. Not that these are absolutes, but they do get the general tone.

I am sure STD will have its fans, as did SGU, I just think, thanks to the loss of many former series fans, that STD will lack the support needed to continue, and, as a result, may do damage to the entire franchise. The only saving grace is that ST fans are generally more fanatical than SG fans, so ST may survive despite the misstep.",28 November 2017
"The show is so blatantly political and represents the far left, SJW, Globalist fantasy of the destruction of unique culture and the promotion of multiculturalism and contrived diversity. Leaving aside their disrespect of the fans and past shows view of what Klingons look like, the show has admitted the portrayal of the Klibgons is based on White nationalists. Apparently, the new Star Trek portrays the Federation as the new Borg. You must accept the destruction of your culture and uniqueness of your race of be assimilated.

This show is nothing but propaganda for the unindoctrinated and a feel good fantasy for far left liberals and SJWs. It completely destroys the legacy of Star Trek.",4 October 2017
"...would be to go boldly! The original series did that in more than 1 way. They had a ruskie at the helm! And that was way back in 1968 at the height of the cold war. And the chief engineer was a Scot! I only say that because of everybody knows that these guys are ferocious alcoholics. So you would trust them with your engines?!

The next one - the next generation - even had an English captain. And..wait for it, a Klingon officer. Now these guys,the Klingons, are supposed to be the start trek equivalent of the evil Russians. At least in the original series and movies. So yes - they continued going boldly. They also featured a female security officer. But not for very long; she mysteriously disappeared after the first season.

We move on to Deep Space Nine and now we really are in full gear 'boldly-go' mode with Captain Cisco. Ignoring the fact that the actor cannot act we should notice though that he was black. And we continue on that path with Voyager which is presenting us with the first female captain, although still very much white.

Which brings us to Enterprise, and that was a bit of a step back, having been canceled after a mere 4 seasons whereas the other follow ups of STTOS would spit out 7 seasons! Would it be the lack of a female black captain? No Russians on board? Only a couple of aliens as star fleet officers. hmm.

But now comes Discovery. They really have something to blow the lids off. And I am not talking about the re-modeled Klingons that look like giant lizards and talk like little school girls. Also not mentioning the first female captain of Chinese ancestry. No nothing so tame as all that. But instead... we have the first gay couple! A couple of gay star fleet officers on board of the star ship Discovery! Now they've done it. Now Star Trek is like another episode of the Bold and the Beautiful. Poor Gene - he knew when it was time to quit.

My rating which 1 star is the minimum you can give here. On rotten tomatoes I would give it a 0 % freshness and it would join the company of such master pieces as Hard Cash, Simon Sez, Precious Cargo and Life on the Line.",17 October 2017
"I was going to give it 4 stars simply because the CGI is incredible and it's quite watchable as a standalone series. But since IMDb insist on giving it 7 stars I need to do my bit. It's ok as a standalone but once they added the Star Trek context it was always going to be judged in that context and in the ST context it's absolute garbage.

Personally Im not a fan of how they were more focused on being politically correct than actually finding interesting and engaging characters and writing quality storylines. I agree with those critics who say this desperation to be super politically correct gender and race wise doesn't work for me. Nothing against women - Janeway was awesome - this cast just isn't. Can't they just cast the right people and leave their political agenda at the door. Also this tough guy attitude studios are trying to give women in movies and series generally is part of a 3rd wave feminist agenda that I can't help but laugh at... Anyway I won't be watching past episode 2.

Lastly, more generally, I hate how the rebooting movies completely crap on long time fans with their alternate timeline. Not necessary to reboot the franchise.",25 December 2017
"I've given this show a good go. I've tried like it but I just can't. It's simply not very good. It started off poorly and to its credit, did get a little better by the third season. You can see the writers had to cut their losses and move the story to a new period in time because of the massive mess that they made during the first 2 seasons.

The third season has potential with the fresh slate it's been given but the cast are just so bland and annoying. They're all so cheesy in their support of the dumb choices of Michael Burnham makes (urgh, that name). All Michael does is cry, ignore orders (yet still save the day) and cry some more. It's embarrassing to watch.

The show runners have indeed gone out of their way to incorporate diversity into the show but have hired some of the most irritatingly smug actors (perhaps that's just the way they're written). It doesn't help that the show focuses almost exclusively on Michael. Remember when you might get an episode following Data and Geordie in Engineering? Or Worf chilling with the Klingons on Q'onoS? There's none of that. So you just don't know about or care for the supporting members of the crew.

This is one of those shows you'll watch while doing something else and immediately forget once the episode ends. It is by far the weakest of all the Star Trek shows.",26 November 2020
"This series again proves how one cannot rely on IMDb as a guide for what shows or movies one should watch. Almost two-thirds of the reviews are negative- yet a rating of 7.3! This is not only the worst Star trek ever but probably the worst sci-fi series ever. Dark sets, wooden acting, bad dialogue, even worse scripts....the list is endless. Only the CGI and costumes are above average - but that does nothing to save this sorry excuse of a turd from being atrocious. I have noticed that the latest reviews are mainly 10 stars- seems the producers have paid people to bring up the ratings!

It reminds me of Reality TV - all hate & anger! Very unprofessional in the real world & very unFederation in the Discovery world.

"Is season 4 written by 13 year old girls? There is more dialog containing content about feelings and being open. Nothing is natural in the interactions between the crew. Huge emotional moments for characters that a person just hasn't connected to. Traveling almost 1000 years into the future and all the crew can talk about is their feelings? Where's the commraderie, the joking around, the normal conversations like ""Hey, how was your day?"" Nearly every conversation between Michael (still think is dumb to name a female character with a male name) and everyone else is how she feels disconnected. This is supposed to be Star Trek, not ""let's all talk about how this jump into the future makes us feel"" Trek. All this show is missing are the sparkling vampires....",28 November 2020

"If you read the reviews previously to this one they all hit the nail on the head with the issues and problems with this show. Its actually so sad how they missed such a great opportunity here. The effects, sets, and costumes are fantastic. Many of the characters are terrific. However the show is the victim of poor writing and bad directing. The bad directing is evident in the horrible over-acting done by Sonequa Martin-Green. She is always over the top with every emotion she has to express. What is with her whispering every sentence? If she had the correct guidance she would most likely have some extremely noteworthy performances. Not noteworthy, as they are now, for being bad. For an example of her extreme overacting go to season 3, episode 9 about 44 minutes in. The character Michael Burnham is on her knees speaking with the empress. In what world, is this a valid performance? Its as if she is imitating The Joker from Suicide Squad which is greatly accepted as a horrible performance. Its not needed here. She could have played this way cooler, it makes no sense for the scene. Leonard Nimoy stated that when he first read the line ""Fascinating"" while taping the original series he did it too emphatically and the director told him to say the line the way a scientist would. Out of this direction a Star Trek lexicon was born. Why do the directors of this show not tell her, ""speak your line, stop whispering"", ""take it down a notch you are over the top"". ""stop crying"". Jeez this show is a victim of over acting at its worse.",22 December 2020
"Season 3 is the writing of the finale writ large - anodyne schlock about as interesting as a magazine at the dentist's office. Roddenberry's vision for the Federation was an idealized future instantiation of the ""shining city on a hill"" - classless, unified, embodying the best of enlightenment values as they venture forthrightly into the void. We could use that exemplar right now. These poor kerdonkulous buffoons get owned by every half-assed Gargamel in the galaxy. At this point I believe the USS Discovery could be commandeered by a limp piece of linguine if it put its mind to it. And here's a tip - character development is supposed to make the characters more compelling in some fashion. Attempting to put the audience into a catatonic trance by sounding the depths of utter banality is a short-term strategy at best. Your special effects budget is wasted when your audience has all drifted to their phones.",8 January 2021
"As a Star Trek Fan since TNG, this insult to its core values doesnt even succeed in decent entertainment due to focus on minority gender studies inclusion. To care for a character is what good entertainment should aim at, though that involves representation of real world stereotypes, which minorities are not. Being apalled by that already, it gets even worse considering most values being acted by are highly negative (betrayal, envy, greed,..) Star Trek once was a source of inspiring values, goose bumps inducing wisdom (f.ex. picards ""with the first link the chain is forged""). But i guess it s all about money now.

Micheal Burnham is an extremely depressing character played by an extremely depressed actress, she was ok for Walking Dead, she's a bad fit for Star Trek - but she's not the reason this show sucks this much - It's wannabe writing by Game of Thrones wannabe writers who don't understand what Star Trek is about

"Ok, she has emotions and I'm absolutely fine with it since I'm no Data myself. But there is not an episode that she's either not crying, whispering or doing both. Certain scenes should evoke emotions in me as a viewer, and they do, though I think angry is not an emotion they were going for.

There are great characters, potentials, acting and even sci-fi which keeps me hooked but the constant crying brings the whole thing down. And it seems to be getting progressively worse and more annoying in season 3. If this was real life these guys would be long dead with the amount of talking (and more crying) they do during pivotal crises.

'Star Trek: Discovery' Cast Takes a Knee After Show's Premiere

The cast members of Star Trek Discovery were slammed by social media users Sunday after a photo of the CBS show's stars taking a knee went viral online. The photo, posted on Discovery star Sonequa Martin-Green's Instagram account, was an apparent show of unity with NFL players protesting the national anthem. Breitbart.",26 September 2017
"If this show suddenly became amazingly good (the opposite of what I saw) after the first few episodes, then I wouldn't know it.

I'm reviewing only the portion I saw (the first few episodes). I really tried to keep watching, but I thought the dialogue and acting were cringeworthy. I think I literally winced when Sonequa Martin-Green (who played a woman named ""Michael"") delivered some of her lines.

It's like they made it a rule to do it all in one take, with no rehearsal.

I LIKED THE LOOK of THE KLINGONS. I thought they did a great job with the makeup (even though they look different). However, when they speak ""Klingon"" language, it seems unnatural.

It's similar to John Malkovich when he speaks in a French accent in Johnny English. Malkovich is a native English speaker, so he had to concentrate on putting on a French accent. This resulted in a forced, measured, SLOW, staccato utterance of ..every ..word.

When you speak in your native language, you just speak full sentences. You don't perspire just trying to get the pronunciation and the words correct. This is how it felt when listening to the Klingon talk (the one who started episode one).

Another thing that was WAY too obvious (it almost always is too obvious), was, at the cost of good screenwriting, the SJW platitudes and themes--fine in their own right, in context, but here they don't support the plot or the characters.

If you, screenwriter/producer, want to impose your fashionable ""victim mentality"" worldview, that's your right as a writer; instead of giving your heroes heroic qualities, just deal them a 'royal flush angst' hand.

And instead of making her a leader (why bother? it's too hard), just make everyone around her bumbling dolts. But you'd better be subtle about it, or else I, the viewer, am gonna have a bumpy ride.

Here's an idea for your next project. Superhero movies are a big hit these days. Make a superhero movie. You can call her, ""The Ultimate Victim."" She can have a sidekick, and the whole movie can be them dealing with snide remarks from white males and patting themselves on the back.

I'm sure it'll get rave reviews from the critics.",6 June 2019
"This has absolutely no business abusing the Trek brand. It is a full complete reboot of Trek stripping everything back to iconic words and names in Star Trek and nothing more.

If you tune in to watch bombastic special effects, stabbing people, blowing them up, gratuitous gore and overuse of VFX with as little boring character development in between them as possible, then this is the show for you!

If you are scientifically curious of your place in the universe, where humanity might end up, and like pretty much all of Trek's past introspection you will absolutely hate STD because it's completely absent, yet abusing Star Trek IP and retconning everything possible to remold it in to an action adventure like the Abrams movies.

We all wanted Trek to be back on TV, ie Trek that has been on TV for five decades. What we didn't expect or want was Trek to be created for TV based upon the flopped reboot movie franchise (2nd movie under- performed, 3rd movie cost Paramount over $50m in gross losses).

Of course, this wasn't known to CBS at the time of the green-light for STD.

Had development of this show waited just another 18 months, ie after Beyond outright bombed, then it may well have followed it's roots rather than following the reboot model when it didn't need rebooting. It's set hundreds of years in the future and you have everything from the 24th century to infinity to explore, why oh why are we being fed ANOTHER REBOOT sandwiched in a slither of 10 years between two pre- existing trek shows?

Oh, that's right, because you can cash in on past successes rather than creating your own.

I've watched three episodes and can't stomach anymore of it. Part of this is out of principal for what CBS is doing to Trek, but mainly as I find it to be extremely poor sci-fi in general.

It's not written for intellect at all, it's very low brow with continual cliff hangers with zero payoff. I don't have the desire or energy to sit through another 12 episodes of this garbage, already having found myself skipping forward through many scenes just to try and get past the action crap and in to some kind of meat.

It's included in my Netflix subscription, all I have to do is click it and watch, but I can't get through it without finding something else to do.

I grew up with TNG, the TOS Movies, DS9, Voy and Ent. I liked them all in their own ways, but that is not difficult because they are all very similar, following the same basic formula and expending upon it's universe.

STD attempts to change everything for the sake of it (likely to get around licensing issues as they are using Paramount's alternative timeline license rather than CBS's), whilst also removing the very core of Trek and leaving behind a shell filled with something completely uninvited.

STD is poison to Star Trek.

Thank god for the Orville.

"This debacle is NOT Star Trek, at best it is the JJ Abrams version of Star Trek, which is not a good thing at all. Now admittedly with his first movie Abrams did reasonably okay, gave me some hope, but then the other two were awful. There's a lot more to Trek than just space battles, which have do their place, but as a support to the story...not the entire story. But most of the best Trek episodes don't even have a space battle in them, dealing with other issues like morals, ethics,justice etc. Episodes like: ""City on the edge of forever"" (TOS) ""The Inner Light"" (TNG) ""Duet"" (DS9) ""The 37's"" (VOY) ""Carbon Creek"" (ENT). A personal list obviously but they were great episodes. But this fell down on so many other levels. Primarily the time in which it is supposed to be set: 10 years prior to Kirk. But it has the appearance of being at least at the same time as TNG (80 years after Kirk) and even further after that in terms of ships appearance and general technology: For example, bridge mounted holographic emitters? They did not come into the series until the last couple of seasons of DS9, which would be the same time period as TNG, almost a century after the Discovery time period. Now I'm not suggesting that they should have copied the appearance of the original series but they could have taken a note from Abrams who did get that part sorted reasonably well in his reboot films (except the engine room of the Enterprise which looks terrible). The acting was awful. Michelle Yeoh as the Captain was so wooden I cringed throughout her lines and Sonequa Martin-Green is just annoying (but then I also found her a bit annoying in The Walking Dead.). The Klingons scenes dragged on and on.....and on. They are totally unconvincing. Their society is supposed to be based upon the Samurai with a bit of Viking thrown in. These were just DULL. The attempt at using them as an analogy for Trump supporters is about as subtle as an air raid. I'm surprised the Klingon bad guy wasn't called T'rump. In fact the entire script felt as if it had been written in an SJW's safe space. The makers have totally missed the point of Star Trek, and considering Bryan Fuller is behind this with his previous connection to the franchise it makes it even more baffling. The history of the universe that was created around the previous Star Trek series is what made the franchise successful. I even like ""Enterprise"", except for the terrible theme tune, which leads me to the next failure: Music. ""Discovery"" has music that is so bland and boring that it is forgotten the moment it hits your eardrums! The theme to Enterprise at the start was annoying but you didn't forget it, (even though you wish you could) and the end credits music was actually not too bad. But ""Discovery""? What music? The credit graphics sequence is just pathetic. It is neither inspiring nor informative. But it does accurately represent the show in that its incredibly dull. The effects are good but in this day and age there is no excuse for them to be anything else. But why is everywhere so dark? Have they got a light bulb shortage in this new time period? If this had been set 80 years after TNG, which is what I thought it was originally going to be from the first reports of its production, then it would be easier to accept. If the Klingons had been a new race instead then there would have been no preconceptions to overcome. But to take the established canon and essentially throw 90% away has raised so many obstacles to overcome that it raises a huge question: Why? To make money obviously. They have hijacked some of the original ideas, concepts and designs of Star Trek, looted its iconography, mutilated what is left and sold it on the back of the fan's expectations, and gave us this travesty. I wanted it to be good, I really, really did. I miss Star Trek. But instead it was dull, boring, lifeless, slow, humourless with uninteresting, totally boring characters, bad script, and apparently no light bulbs. Then, as if that was not enough, why in Gods name is the female lead character called ""Michael""?! Actually the question is rhetorical, I know its because it is Fullers ""motif"", apparently. Well Mr Fuller, all I can say is that your ""motif"" is not ""quirky"", its stupid, very irritating and completely unnecessary......not unlike this show. I have tried to watch the third episode but turned it off, life is too short to waste watching this badly conceived, badly acted, badly written, badly directed and, God knows, badly lit, load of boring rubbish! To CBS all I can say is: You messed it up! You dismissed the fan's and this will not win you any new ones. Save yourselves money and cancel it. If this is the best you can come up with to reintroduce the franchise then I can only conclude that, to my dismay,Star Trek is dead! Let it rest in peace. Long Live Star Trek!",5 October 2017
"Honestly, I don't care about the Star Trek lagecy stuff or any other virtue, but I do care about if the show could give me a well constructed story, and it almost did it.

However, the biggest failure is the main character Michael.

The pick of Michael's actor is not reasonable. No offence, but this actress is not well suited for this role at all.

The show is keeping audience to see a selfish Michael who pretend to be selfishless. Her strange overconfident and I-fix-all attitude really prevents from totally enjoy the show.

Worse, such a stubborn, overconfident, hypocrisy sometimes switch to a sensitive mode that hurt everyone again and again.

If she is rised in Vulkan with rule of Logic, why on earth is she the most unstable and emotional person in the show?

The show is truely a personal movie and I really hate the mixture -- Michael Burnham. I seek no wisdom or elegance in this character.

Other than this biggest problem, there are some problem remains unanswered in the end, don't know if it is simply overlooked.

And the biggest logical problem is that, She DID start the war after all yet the show turns to deflect that. And perhaps she is also the ultimate trouble maker who just could fix the trouble after the damage has already been done deeply. Very sick.

I find some common between STD and Lost in Space becasue both show is presenting you a story of troublemakers.",25 March 2020
"Even after only two episodes you can clearly see the core of a good idea hiding in Discovery, it is just a massive shame that the writing and directing make it almost unbearable to watch. Characters just fire lines back and forth at each other like it's a race to end the script; no one ever thinks about a how to answer a question or takes a moment to consider what to say next. The dialog is so stilted and unnatural I had to pause and resume dozens of times as my mind boggled through the two pilot episodes.

To give an example, in the opening 5 minutes there is just a massive exposition dump where the first officer walks through a desert explaining to the captain why they are on the planet. Try and imagine for one second how that could possibly work; the second-in-command knows more about why they are there than the captain. Did they not think to discuss any of these details before they beamed down? Did the first office get some secret orders that even the captain doesn't know about? What did the captain think was the reason for beaming down, a surprise party?

Later the science officer discovers an anomaly which is disrupting the sensors. He describes as ""an object of unknown origin"", the captain immediately tells him ""Let's be more specific"". He's just told her he doesn't know what it is; what exactly is she expecting him to say in response? ""Well captain, I don't know how long it is, I don't know how wide, I don't know what it's made of...""?

Then there is the writer's utter scientific illiteracy; the Klingon are going to use a massive torch to signal the great houses. With light; light which travels at the speed of light. Towards planets tens or hundreds of light years away. Meaning at best the light will take decades to reach anyone. Even the nearest federation outposts ""Eagle 12 Station"" and ""Gamma-Hydra Colony"" are 3 and 6 light years away respectively according to the captain. Yet some how Sarek, (who apparently spends all day standing around waiting to pick up his hologram phone) has seen ""a new star in the sky"" all the way on Vulcan.

The idea of a member of Star Fleet who mutinies in order to save the ship who then gets court-marshaled is a very interesting direction. Taking the focus away from the bridge and seeing what it's like from the perspective of a menial 'red shirt' opens up a lot of new story telling opportunities.

"I'm a huge Star Trek fan, pretty much since the beginning. Star Trek Discovery marks for me a low point in the series. Not because it's darker than any other Star Trek before, but because it's filled with overemotional characters and a focus on one Person.

Past series didn't have such a strong focus on one main character like Discovery has. Michael Burnham is the culprit. She also seems to be the most emotional character, breaking down whenever she has an opportunity for it, acting reckless and saving the day every day. Alone.

Star Trek brought with Uhura a black woman on TV when nobody else did. And a Russian, at the height of the cold war. Star Trek has nothing to prove. Unfortunately the focus seems to be not on Teamwork, Science, Discovery and humanity at it's best, but about proving the point that Burnham can do it all alone in an ego trip.

Completely ruins the show and fun. And that's sad. The graphics and CGI is phenomenal. Stunning details, stunning camera work. It's a masterpiece when it comes to the work of the artists - even if the Klingon look is up for debate.

But the rest is garbage and might be a telltale sign of the times and that Star Trek is just done for. I guess the wrong people are leading it, and so I went back to watch the best Star Trek, the first and original one on Netflix. My god is it good. The acting, the humor, just everything. The entertainment is amazing, and political correctness nowhere to be seen.

I strongly recommend Captain Kirk over this piece of garbage.

Even in the most heated action- and battle sequences, the actor always find time to share their love, passion, forgiveness, sadness, doubts and on and on and one. At this point I'm just waiting till they break out into song and we've got Disney in space.

It's annoying. It's to much. It feels as if the creators told themselves: ""We've got to go with the times. We need a strong black woman as main character, lots of gays & lesbians (nothing wrong with it, but why the focus?) and we need to focus on them and their problems. Fill it with emotional heartbroken moments, whenever you can!""

Sorry Star Trek, but you lost me on this one. There's enough series out there that are emotional and made for main stream. This is unnecessary, over the top, and you lost me on this one. Most likely for good.

Edit: Didn't watch Season 3 and onwards. Cant deal with more of that crap",23 April 2019
"The writing and ideas for tech in this are really exceptional. So much to be commended on, but...the show got the politically correct LGBQT bug. I don't care about a reasonable real life representation of diversity, I actually prefer something diverse and normal. But why dominate the primary cast with heavy female and gay roles unless you don't want to represent real life and have some agenda?",2 January 2022
"I'll start by saying I wasn't able to watch this series further than Episode 4 ""The butcher's knife cares not.."". The stupidity by some of the characters simply to move the plot along was almost satirical and it simply isn't enjoyable watching a miserable crew getting snippy with each other week after week. Some say these characters are ""complex"". I say they're immature and dull.

Overall the visuals have been great. I'm sure the production team had a good time designing and creating the sets and costumes, but I see what others mean about it losing that 'trek' feel.

I was going to rate this higher, but then I spied a review that mentioned something called ""Prelude to Axanar"". I went, I watched, I realised why so many trek fans are peeved about Discovery. A short 20 minute fan film costing next to nothing managed to beat the pants off of every Discovery episode to date. So the 4 stars isn't just for the show, which isn't entirely terrible as a standalone sci-fi. It's also for taking the name Star Trek without doing their prior research, without finding a director and writers who really understand what the fans want, and for trying to slap some Game of Thrones style darkness on a popular franchise to make a quick buck. Basically the creators missed the point and the fans are understandably knarcked.

I hope Discovery improves in later series, but right now it's fairly bland, with mediocre writing, and seems to be a bit of a money-grab attempt with no real love for the existing franchise behind it.

Fortunately I've been introduced to the world of fan films, so hopefully those will fill my Trekky needs till the next inevitable reboot.

Edit: So after deciding not to watch any more Discovery I thought I'd check out Orville and it's brilliant. Warm-hearted, optimistic, funny, and with a seriously ""star-trek"" vibe. Highly recommended for anyone let down by STD.

Edit 2: I find some of the anti-progressive vitriol quite disturbing. I gave the show 4 stars because it's a mediocre show and a bad Star Trek series. I have zero issues with the show's themes, casting choices, or political leanings.",15 October 2017

"There's nothing wrong with being female or having any particular skin colour, or even being an alien species. It's just that any TV show that has a long history should carry on with the same or similar standards as the history and narrative of those previous shows and Movies. If you like cartoonish effects, strange lighting and camera angles and token females and human ethnicities that takes precedence over acting ability or personal charisma, then maybe plough your own furrow with your own TV series.

Klingons that don't look like Klingons. Michelle Yeoh is wooden and hard to understand. She probably had never heard of Star Trek until she was approached for the role. Somewhat sounds like a Hong Kong noodle stand owner. 'Wou yu lik mor soy sau we dat? Maybe I'm being overly cruel as she's acting in a 2nd language, and the fault is really down to poor casting.

Sonequa Martin-Brown is a good actor, but I really feel she doesn't have the charisma for the role as 2nd officer.

Lt Saru was easily the best character, in fact he should have been cast as the Captain.

"I'm sorry but the word ""trash"" is what comes to mind when I think of a descriptive to use on this show. It is not only bad Star Trek it is bad television. The writing is bad. The editing is subpar for a show with this much money. The camera work is the worst I have ever seen. The acting is atrocious. The special effects are so over the top they actually look bad. And the characters are down right unlikable and unrealistic. The story telling, plot, and overall settings are bad. In fact, I can't for the life of me picture nearly any of these characters being permitted in Star Fleet, let alone getting placed in a situation and setting like they are in this show.

Some of my personal worst scenes in television history can be pulled straight from episodes of this show. It's that bad.

And we haven't even gotten into the disrespect it has for the franchise it is based on. The history is wrong. The technology is wrong. The aliens are wrong. most of the ships are wrong. The cultures are wrong. The dialogue and situations are wrong. Everything is wrong. I only gave it two stars because the opening scene of the show was kinda promising until it went almost immediately all wrong and never recovered.

This is a ridiculous, poorly made romp through the galaxy that is meant to appease to what I'm guessing is an audience of about thirteen to seventeen years of age. If I could suggest what should be done with this show, I would say that it needs to be placed in a trash heap with about 80% of the ""reality"" television that has been made, set on fire, and then plowed over so that we can all forget that it existed and can get back to the science fiction worthy of our attention.",27 June 2020
"This show advertises itself as a Star Trek tv show, but has hardly any of the elements of one. While it has the Vulcans and the Klingons, it does not have any of the optimism, heart, or strong characters. It's so dark and mopey.

"For a while, it was an 8. But, frankly, I got tired of the angst of the Emperor. Too much of a good thing! HA!

If only Michael would learn to talk in a normal tone. Instead, she whispers - 90% of the time. Who does that in real life? Speak up! Just a normal speaking voice! No wonder I fell asleep in some of the episodes.

Season 3 (which is as far as I have gotten) has been a fast forward season for me - especially Terra Firma - Parts 1 AND 2 - ARGH! WAAAAAAAAAY toooooooo long. That lost a star on its own. A lot if the graphics look as if someone put down a basic picture and then added more cut outs and took photos. It was really bad. The worst I've seen in years.

Tig Notaro got it a star! You have to love her. What dry wit and perfection in her delivery. They use her just enough to leave us wanting more.

But I need to take a break before I go on to season 4. I don't remember the last time I binged a series and stopped mid-way. But I expected more from this series. It's lagging and I've become bored with it.

Maybe if I take a break, and come back, I'll appreciate it more. Right now, I'm just bored with it.

This show has destroyed everything that the original series of Star Trek created. There is nothing left.

The production is fine, acting is not awful, but the directing gives fragmentation in place of action, which leads to little engagement with the story and all the flash-backery and emo-angst gives a feeling of unease instead of empathy with the characters. Towards the end, I found myself wondering when the depressed, gender or body dysphoric cyborg with dyscalculia was going to make an appearance *shudder*.

"This IS NOT a StarTrek by ANY means! Half of the show shot in dark with weird camera angles that are not parallel to the floor. Instead of a bright future with characters exploring the universe, rethinking their moral standings, sharing diplomacy; we get a dark, cold, boring show that focuses on war and hate from the first minute. And yes; the Klingons are now Space-Orcs.

"I'll be damned... and here I was worried they're not going to make more Star Trek motion pictures!

Jokes aside, this felt very much like the Kelvin timeline film, and not at all like the Star Trek TV series. Is that such a bad thing? Not really - if you like the action packed shiny summer flicks.

But is this the Trek we were waiting for?

Lets start from the regular introduction that is in our modern day of age is required, not to be branded -ist of some sort:

Actors were hit with the ""Hayden Christensen effect"", term I apply to good actors, giving their best performance under horrible direction. Female lead, male lead, black, white, andorian - makes no difference - you couldn't get those characters with those lines to work in any configuration of gender and/or race. Scott Bakula, Kate Mulgrew, Avery Brooks, Patrick Steward and William Shatner put together couldn't make this better.

Having women in leading positions is a daily bread for any Trek fan for years. Same with non- whites in the same role. My criticism aims only at the direction of the new series - not what genetic configuration actor exhibits.

My inner Trekkie yelled out in terror when Michelle Yeoh's (who gave best performance in the show in my opinion) character was asked ""What does the soldier in you say?"" and she answered ""Nothing good."" Inner soldier? What kind of Starfleet is this? Are you sure this isn't a Mirror universe? (now that would be a series...)

Conflict and war isn't something new in the Star Trek universe, but it was always handled with great care and understanding of what a hostility should be in a character-driven show. In each Star Trek series, major conflicts were introduced long after we're familiar with the crew - tension came from us knowing and caring for the protagonist, hoping them to succeed in the struggle.

Discovery gives the most gentle characterisation to the main characters, before thrusting them into combat. As a result, scenes that should provoke strong emotions - were seen as ""red shirt"" deaths.

Visuals of the series are outstanding and made an impression on someone who isn't easy to impress with visual light show. Remade Klingons don't feel like Klingons, but their look, aesthetics and style is quite impressive in their own right, even if they remind Remans now and again.

Star Trek fans crave smart, nuanced writing a hard-hitting emotional episodes. Stuff like ""Duet"", ""Far Beyond the Stars"", ""The City on the Edge of Forever"", ""Tapestry"", ""Blink of an Eye"", ""Cogenitor"".

Making a Star Trek series, one must understand what won Star Trek such a devoted following! If you're not going to understand what made Star Trek, you might as well call your generic sci- fi series something else. I don't know... like Orville? Oh-- wait...",25 September 2017

I just fast forward to the plot points and the action. Thanks goodness that there are other sci fi shows killing it at the moment as I won't miss when this finally gets cancelled.

"This mess would have been better off left to paper in a vault at the bottom of the ocean. Not at all what you would expect from the Star Trek franchise.

It looks like they tried to fluff it all up with social and political ideology, and forgot the add a plot. It's a sad day when the writers would allow their ideology to destroy one of the greatest franchises in TV history.

The acting is at best sub-par, and it does show. I have no idea what the crew was doing, but it looks like a drunk five year old filmed it on a $10 hand-held camera. It almost makes you dizzy just trying to watch it.

I did suffer through the first two episodes, but after about the first fifteen minutes I knew it was all wrong. I've watched every episode of every series before this, and this will be the first series I'm skipping.

"The positive reviews must be paid by CBS.... :(

The show is horror.

The topic of the show is the epic battle between good and evil. This is corporate-military brainwashing, financed with big Hollywood dollars. This is not a bright future for humankind like Gene Roddenberry envisioned.

The show also has quite some racist slurs, Klingons are ""by nature"" the evil aggressor. Far from the great Klingon stories in TOS/TNG (like ""Errand of Mercy"", TOS S1 E26). Some scenes (""we have to shoot first"") are - from an ethical standpoint of view - unworthy and on the intellectual level of goons and bruisers (""i get my self esteem from showing that I am the boss"")).

The plot of the first two episodes is so shallow, it could be told in 10 minutes. There is no arc of suspense, no plot twist, no allegory or morality of the story.

The CGI looks rubbish (in 2017??). It looks like early 2000ies, with added motion blur and lens flare. Those explosions... like 1999. And the real sets (like the bridge) look cheap, seriously.

The characters are flat and unmotivated, their intentions are not derived from the plot, but from artificially introduced ""flashbacks"".

This is especially evident when the Klingons are being subtitled. Unless you speak Klingon, good luck...even Americans can't read that fast...no one can!

"Tedious beyond belief. The lead character Michael Burnham is a self absorbed, entitled brat. Why can't star trek do strong female leads? The 'side' characters are much more interesting. The story was dragged out to a predictable end of Michael sat in the Captain's chair, suffused with golden light and everybody lived happily ever after. Some particular niggles: Why can nobody fight in star trek - oh yes, that's right, it's a science vessel, but surely going boldly etc there is the strong possibility that things might get a bit lairy, so you know, you'd think they might at least be a little bit prepared. And the space fight scenes... sometimes the ship is knocked out with barely a couple of well judged strikes, and other times it battles away like a good un, taking on whole fleets (last episode of s2) - make your mind up - which is it!?

The good bits, it looked great. The crew were engaging (haha see what I did there), and it was nice to see gender and neuro diversity handled so matter of factly and without glory seeking from the makers. It just was. As it should be. Welcome to the 21st Century.

Why is this important? Because as a Star Trek fan I expect certain meta-standards. Some restrained sexuality and relationships are okay... making it a high school mating dance is not. I can get enough of that from 99 other shows on TV.

Star Trek: TOS, TNG, Voyager etc. were primarily about exploration. This pile of steaming garbage is just about war. Not an exciting tense war like in Battlestar Galactica, just a boring war.

Previous series had likable and interesting characters, good stories, philosophy, humour and a dream of what humanity could become. 'Discovery' has none.

The Klingons dont even look or act like Klingons. The only good thing was the special effects. But that was done poorly to. This is set prior to Kirk and TOS. But the science looks like its almost better than The Next Generation. What were these people thinking? Enterprise wasn't great, but at least they didn't have terraforming that took only a few years.

"To be honest, I have been always immune to the petty fights between Trek fans -- I liked Voyager and Enterprise, never considered Braga & Berman as someone who 'destroyed' the franchise, really didn't care if some episode explained something differently to a previous series, the only problem I have ever had with Star Trek was TOS as it was too outdated for me and I just couldn't shake that feeling and concentrate of the episodes' plot.

Then the new movies happened and while I didn't hate them, I could see they are not for me anymore. Let's be honest, nearly all of the previous Trek movies had also focused more on the fun/action part than the true Trek values and yet maintained the original spirit. I couldn't feel that spirit anymore but hey, new actors, new settings, maybe it was just me.

And then ... this. I even didn't know Discovery is on air, didn't follow the news so closely so I certainly didn't have any expectations at all. I watch the first, second, third episode... and just can't believe my eyes. It's pointless to repeat all the great reviews here, it's just... awful.

Starting with the awful intro music (maybe matter of taste, Enterprise's one was on the edge for me), intro graphics (not getting it even after 10 episodes), actors (I agree the first captain was the only likeable character), plot (shouldn't USS Discovery be actually, you know, discovering something instead of being the #1 war machine?) and general dark/desperate setting.

I wouldn't have minded all the technology, holograms etc, the same complaints had been made on Enterprise and look how terribly different show it is from STD.

The strangest feeling for me is that I remember reading an interview with Bryan Fuller, how he has this 'true Roddenberry' plot and setting in mind and how the bad, bad guys at CBS didn't allow him to continue his grandiose plot, well, I don't know. This show is terrible from the first minute, really don't see any further damage done later on.

""He (Fuller) and Kurtzman developed this story from ""so many elements of Star Trek"", taking certain episodes of the original series and using their ""DNA"" to find ""the spirit of what Star Trek offers, both in terms of high-concept science fiction storytelling and really wonderful metaphors for the human condition"".

My only hope and I mean hanging on here is captain Pike his character is good and is why I gave this show 1 star.. It's a sad day as a fan iv turned off this show and can't see myself going back they have ruined what was once an amazing show..,6 March 2019

"There was an episode of CSI (""A Space Oddity"") that shows the creator of a Trek-like show called Astro Quest murdered when he tries to release a dark, gritty version of the show. I think that someone should bring to justice the people who conspired to murder the Trek franchise.

I will offer CBS a plea bargain. Take the Star Trek logo off of Discovery and offer it as an original series. Furthermore, I would suggest that the Trek franchise be retired and opened up to the fans.

Seriously, Discovery does not share any real commonality with the original trek franchise. This might be worth watching, but it isn't star trek and it should not be billed as such.",21 February 2018
"Star Trek used to be about the most important humanistic conflicts an individual or a society as a whole endures and struggle to evolves.

The underlying story arc is great but full of distractions associated with political talking points.

Star Trek always brought important discussions to the screen but in a sense that they were part of the story itself. In this version, unfortunately, the story often deviates from its core to play a role of leftistm political discourse. Transcendent questions in previous installations were there without being forced as part of an artificial dialogue. The unsaid things in TNG and the Original Series were way more powerful to prove that humans had evolved in some aspects (and yet were still plagued by some idiosyncrasies) than shallow scripted dialogues wrapped around today's themes of our society as being done in ST Discovery.

Besides that, ST Discovery has great actors, great special effects and Sound Effects, thus, 3-stars for the show.

Poor direction Poor photography (except for the first two episodes of season 1 which were fantastic) Poor script Shallow dialogues appealing to emotional aspects 100% of the time without a rational equilibrium or alternate perspective to balance

I hope they get this train back on its Treks!",5 March 2019
"The initial trailers for Discovery had me worried. Then we had the delay in release, coupled with the backstory of internal turmoil. Now I understand why it was delayed, because they kept trying to polish a turd in the hope that it would shine. It didn't work.

The only saving graces in Discovery are the reasonably good visual effects, and Saru - apparently the only person in the cast who gets the ST universe.

Apart from that I couldn't care less if any of the cast live or die, which really shows how badly developed this entire premise is. The only other time I felt so disassociated from a cast was with Alien Covenant, where I just wanted the xenomorphs to chop them all up into tiny little pieces. I'd probably donate money to have Michael Burnham shot head first out of a photo torpedo launcher. No suit though. Just to be sure.

Anyways...what you get here is a politically correct romp through a social justice universe that has some of the worst acting you'll see this side of the Gamma quadrant - it's awful.

CBS have managed to create a show that's tried to appeal to so many audiences that it appeals to none, except the ST fans who are willing to watch any old pile'o'crap.

Whoever they're paying to upvote this piece of awful muck on IMDb won't be able to keep the facade up for much longer.

Please don't make a second season. Don't even think about it.",12 October 2017

"Growing up watching Star Trek I loved how the stories and the characters were what is considered ""woke"" now at the time. Obviously my dads and my Star Trek series weren't ""woke"" enough. I applaud any show that tries to include or promote inclusion and diversity but Discovery has done this with a sloppy red crayon and it honestly makes me cringe at how contrived and poorly thought out the writing particularly around the characters is. I actually like the casting but feel sorry for these people as it is clear the talent ends there. Discovery boldly goes nowhere without having to have two or three episodes of whisper dialogue heart to heart support group talks before hand. These star fleet officers are supposedly from the same era as Kirk and Spock and yet they behave like wimpy millennial snowflakes! The lack of decorum and overall losing attitude is really distracting. I have heard this show often described as garbage or ""woke trash"" I do not agree that choosing to write stories that are more inclusive and challenge current stereotypes automatically make something some trash but with all the style and no substance Discovery literally pukes at us after 4 seasons I have to agree this show is garbage.",1 January 2022

"Don't bother to criticize this series, CBS does not care, for a very simple reason : the old fans, especially those who started watching in the '60s, are dying off. CBS wants to catch new generations of unsuspecting people so that they can milk them for all the money that they are worth for a long time. People who are new to Star Trek possibly won't want to watch the old series, like that hippie show from the '60s (prehistoric age), or that dated and way to long series (Next Generation) from the '80s. Don't forget that a lot of people possibly think that everything that came before they got their first smart phone is not worth noticing. The competition are «Game of Thrones» and «House of Cards», big CGI special effects, and things have to move very fast. So this new thing will probably be popular enough and will keep on passing for Star Trek, even if it is only a bad science-fiction male teenage fantasy. Live long and prosper anyway.",9 October 2017
"Star Trek has certain defining qualities as they have been established by previous shows:

It's about science fiction, as in how technological advances affect our everyday life.
It's about philosophical questions and dilemmas
It's about leadership and honour
It's about deep, memorable characters
It's about human relationships
It's about exploring the unknown
It's about principles and inspiration


This show has none of these defining qualities. Call it whatever you want, but it's not Star Trek. If you like to watch it as a poor man's Battlestar Galactica or even Star Wars, give it a try -- but you're going to be disappointed nevertheless.",4 January 2020
"I love everything Star Trek. No matter how bad it is I will watch it because it's Star Trek. The first two seasons were good, the third one wasn't that bad. This one has me questioning what happened.

The IMDb rating is 7 as I write this. Should be a 7.8 to an 8.2. I fear the ratings generated from people watching season four will bring the overall rating down to a 5.2.

Which is a generous number for season 4. Season four is just awful.

Makes me wonder how discovery got a season four and 160+ episodes while another show that's more like Star Trek can't get a fourth season. The Oreville. Season 3 of The Orville shames discovery.

I'll keep watching because it's Star Trek. And I will complain because it is taking a dive to the bottom of the fleet. Very very sad.

And, that's why I give it such a low rating. Season four is killing it. Watched the first three seasons it was a solid 7.5. And with better writing it would have been higher.

I have seen other programs where people have said after a few seasons it has gone astray and not worth watching. I hope season five changes the direction for Discovery. And I know it will. Because It can't get much worse. Or can it?",4 June 2023
"What started as a fresh take on Klingons turned by the end of season 3 into a show that gets offended if someone doesn't like it. The episodic nature of Star Trek and joys of discovering strange new worlds and species have been replaced with multiple season spanning end of the universe arc which is then replaced with another end of the universe etcetera, with no real tension, and no science. Just a bunch of technobabble, tears and questionable writing.",25 November 2021

If you're like me, invested in seasons 1 and 2.. just put season 3 on and fold laundry, read a book (The Expanse novels), do your taxes, peel an onion, buy a sledgehammer and get thru it.... horrible whiny show.

"I do agree with many of the previous reviews that the writers did not stick with the ""feel"" of star trek. My only real displeasure with the series is how they changed the klingons, they reminded me more fo the Narn in Babylon 5 than the Klingons in star trek.

I did not have as much an issue with the acting, or the special effects as some. I believe in watching a show for the entertainment value. But changing a major race like this, and changing much of the history as they did made this show hard to enjoy. Especially, having Jonathan Frakes as a director, he should have known better.

Not sure I am going to want to see season 2",4 July 2018
"Terrible portrayal of the Star Trek spirit. A dystopian view of the future, with all kinds of bad writing and acting. The story itself hinges on a FTL ""Spore drive transport"" - wow - who thought of that? Typical plot - the main character saves the world then goes to prison, only to get liberated by a real captain.

To me Star Trek is about relatable characters and looking into a brighter, slightly idealistic future. I watched 4 episodes and had to stop as it was so far from what Star Trek means to me. They turned the klingons into faceless evil. The captain is unrelatable, and there is way too many special effects.

This is basically Feminazi/SJW/BLM Ghostbusters all over again. And it's amazing that they ever thought this show would ever be successful. The ratings will stay low.

"No lie, i am a star-trek fun long years. And from the last one I was waiting a new line of series. And here comes Discovery.

We can not expect so detail work like movies in series. Effect are over average for a TV series. But Startrek was never a subject of effects. The story is totally a mess and full of stolen parts from other Startreks.

Come on!! Moment zero and you are asking to emphasize the stolen dialog of being human between Cap.Janeway and Seven from Voyager.

I think you really wanted to have fun with Klingons. Who designed that costumes. Klingons are warriors not circus freaks and dummies. You should put some candies to hand and we should watch a carnival.

Telepathy from far from light years. People this is Startrek, not star-gate or star wars. WTF!! First time I am seeing in a Startrek series something scientifically not probable.

Casting is also another matter. To have different nations in crew is a star-trek tradition. To let them see to work together in harmony beside differences. Awful choice of cast for Vulcan Mentor. Did you really think about it twice? With also bad make up he was the most funny looking Vulcan ever. When I was seeing starring Sonequa Martin-Green performance, i felt like i am watching Halle Berry in Oscar ceremony with tears. What a scandal! :)

"It really is as if the creators of Star Trek Discovery have never actually watched any of the previous series, and drew all their inspiration from the modern movies and non Start Trek sources. This is not Star Trek. This is just another Sci-Fi series set in space with familiar terminology and forgettable characters.

Even the ""worst"" of previous Star Trek series allowed you to get to know the characters, care about them, root for them. Right now a series about the lives of the Klingon crew and ship would be preferable to this.

A few people mentioned The Orville TV series. Yes, that definitely comes closer to what we're looking for. In fact, if Star Trek is heading this way, then someone else SHOULD pick up Gene Roddenberry's torch.

The media is flooded with movies and TV series that is all flash and no substance. Star Trek Discovery was supposed to be different. It isn't.",27 September 2017
"It's philosophical premise isn't as biased as some early statements made it sound, as it presents both a for and against argument on the modern trend of isolationism.

One could equally read Islam, or north Korea into it, Poland, brexit, or trump. It speaks to imperialism, peaceful or otherwise, and ideology, in a way that isn't entirely black and white. So that part is good.

The pandering seems a bit odd, in the modern day, 2017. A post-racial society would have more mixing, and less accents, and be more blended. Perhaps this is an ideological blind spot, that multi-culturalism in fact leads to homogeneity rather than diversity is something people don't see. But that, along with small framed women having more strength than one would expect is a small issue, and political correctness is hardly limited to this series.

The bigger issue really is the writing. Its war focused, but lacks grit. So whilst battlestar might be held up as a sort of template of a sci-fi war series, this feels clean, and neutered. Moralising. Moralising in a war based context feels strange. It robs the star trek universe of plausibility in its optimism, making it seem, almost like some dystopia where people are not allowed to question, rather than a utopia where people have transcended issues of the past.

And the war focus, and non-captain focus, leaves one feeling like its not trek. Trek is about a team of people, a diverse group with different personalities - a crew. This shows war focus, and narrow character focus feels pretty unfamiliar to the series. Change can be a good thing, but I think there's a certain soul that's lacking in the variant.

Time will tell, but for now, the orville is the far better spiritual successor to trek, despite its lower budget. At least however, despite the spectre of political correctness, and narrowly focused but PG war narrative, there is a sense in which the themes themselves have depth, nuance. And perhaps the characters will emerge as the series goes on.",25 September 2017
"First review, a year ago --

The three stars it gets was for special effects. They got that right. The transporter effect was nice.

However, I've been a Trek fan since TOS. But I came away from the first episode not caring for the plot, the characters, nothing.

I'm certainly not paying money to watch any more. I'll wait until it's free then watch. Maybe.

Second review, a year later --

I had promised myself that I wouldn't pay for the service to watch this, but 4 days of being stuck at home with a bad cold, I had to watch something. I figured I could binge through all the published episodes before time ran out.

Okay, I liked Picard. I know its a divisive entry, and I get hate for it. But, oh well. I'm biased and loved seeing Sir Patrick Stewart back in kind-of(?) action.

The nostalgia has worn off a bit, but I still stand by my feelings for that one.

Discovery, however, has money and shine with no ideas or intrigue.

First, I don't want more prequels. We got Star Trek Enterprise already. Another divisive entry in the series, yet one that really found its stride and produced some truly classic Trekisodes.

Second, I don't want your alternate take on the lore. I'm frustrated that they had this much money and talent wasted on such a near-insulting shallow take on a beloved franchise.

By the way, The Expanse exists. That's a damn good sci-fi show. Have you seen the Stargate series? Even some classic shows in there too, if you can tolerate cheese.

They should use concepts from those influential shows as some sort of Discovery for a way to make this Trek not completely ruin the franchise.

Star Trek: Discovery is a, I'll say it again, shallow soap opera in space. It's not all bad, but it's the worst of any other Star Trek canon in my eyes.

Furthermore, it adds ridiculous technologies and concepts to the history.

It is pretty sometimes though. And it does have some okay episodes every once a while.

"The first 3 seasons of this series are fantastic. Fresh visual effects, unique technology, a diverse cast, lots of action, and story lines with universal impacts keep the viewer engaged. Season 3 into season 4, the focus of the show really changes... The plotlines change from science, exploration, alien encounters, and occasional action, to what amounts to repeated personal therapy sessions. Scenes focus on interpersonal relationships, varying emotional issues among the crew, deep emotional conversations, (with a heavy focus on female/gay/Bi characters), and a male ""empath"" character who can't get over the emotional pain of losing his planet/family to a spatial anomaly. Any strong, male characters have all but disappeared, and only occasionally show up as guest cast members. In short, the producers decided mid-stream to change their intended audience: The Millennial, LBGTQ, crowd. It's ironic that in the quest for diversity, they've missed the target, and gone in the opposite direction.

"RIP Star Trek. This series will officially be the series that has killed the Star Trek legacy. I knew that if this show failed, Star Trek would be dead forever. Calling this show ""Star Trek"" is an insult. There has been no character development so far, other than with the main character who is boring, annoying, uninteresting and pouty.

This show jumps right to war, which is completely meaningless since it has built no emotional interest with any characters. Compare that to another Trek series like DS9 which took several seasons of character dialogue, evolution, backstory, complex story lines with several alien races, etc, before a war started. THAT war mattered.

The ""Klingons"" (if that's what you want to call them) could wipe out Discovery and the viewers wouldn't even feel bad about it.

The 2 semi-interesting characters so far are Captain Lorca and the first officer guy, but both of them haven't had much camera time as the writers obviously made a point to focus on Mark, I mean Michael.

I have to say - as big of a Star Trek fan as I am, The Orville is succeeding at holding my interest WAY more than Discovery is at this point. It's sad to say that a comedy/parody is actually staying more true to Star Trek than the real ""Star Trek.""

The crew members meanwhile are like hormon steered teenagers, always ready to break into tears, to talk like pupils in the classroom (and definetely not like grown up professionals) and to do something really stupid ""off the book"". A lot of talk is invested in fealings. Yes, it is a science fiction series. Sometimes. But most of the time it's like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer meets Star Wars"".

There's no connection to Star Trek as we know it, except for the outfit and some storyline borrowed by older series. But don't let them fool you, you won't have fun with this if you're much older than 20 or if you're even a fan of the older series.

Well, maybe it's time for the kids now, but I doubt it. This show is much too bad to be a success. And since Star Trek Picard is even worse, I fear this is the end of the idea of Star Trek itself.

Edit: it also breaks a fundamental rule of all Star Trek Series: They all get better with the time - here it's the opposite. I'm not sure whether I'm able to watch season 3 till the end or even watch the upcoming season 4. Well, sometimes it's like watching an accident in slow motion, so I guess I'll do it while feeling like an idiot. After that I have to binge watch TNG, DS9 and STE in a row, to erase all that lousy scenes from my head.",25 November 2020
"I have been a ST fan since the 70s watching reruns of TOS, all the movies all the follow up series, but my God, this is horrible writing and acting. Micheal cries and whisper talks every episode, she is now the most annoying character on STD. And OMG, does EVERY planet have to be run by a woman???? Is this what equality looks like, just a reversal of roles? I don't think Gene would approve of the writing direction or that overwrought SJW subversion of equality. This may be enough for me....at least the Mandalorian is more balanced. Hopefully Picard and the upcoming Pike series will be more balanced.",28 November 2020
"What the hell were the creators thinking when they wrote this? This show is really trying hard to completely ruin ""Star Trek"" brand.

Good things about this show: 1. Overacting at its best 2. How to make a show with no story 3. above all, how to create FAKE ratings on IMDB to promote a complete waste of time.

It's a real shame.",21 March 2019
"MINOR SPOILERS CONTAINED...BE WARNED

UPDATE I watched the third episode. I tried to remain open minded, I want to like the show. However it's a complete reboot, following JJ Abrams Star Trek with nothing a purist of Star Trek would like. It has lots action, it has lots of CGI, everything seems to be shown at a angle (like the old batman shows of the 60s). All the characters are unethical, with the main characters coming across as flawed, cavalier, and more evil than the Klingons who at least are fighting for a cause. It is probably a reflection of modern society, violent, self interests, and without consideration for others. It seems every episode will end on a cliff hanger. I can sum it up as a sci-fi series with lots of actions, angry women, evil guys, and lots of violence etc....there isn't much Star Trek in it. It's a good effort but not a Star Trek series - so that is why so many are giving it negative reviews. I will stick to the 5 stars. If it had not pretended to be a Star Trek series, I probably would give it 6-6.5 stars as it watchable. Orville is more 'Trekkie' than this series.

The Good

(1) Finally CBS did a new Star Trek series to satisfy Trekkies. I will give them credit for that. (2) Set 10 years before Kirk, a great potential for stories whilst the federation was still developing (3) Plenty of sources available in the Enterprise Series, TOS, and TNG which this series could connect (4) Some nice SFX/CGI (5) Starts off with a bang !

The Bad

(1) Serious continuity issues, the ship looks ultra sleek, more advanced than the TNG (2) The acting is very wooden, and the characters act in an unprofessional manner...I know we like to have characters with some flaws, but mutiny due to a first contact mission? (3) Technology more advanced than the timeline suggests (4) The gender issue and promotion of social issues, whilst admirable, and something Roddenberry would have encouraged, is abit too OTT. In the future it is was about equality, not making male characters weak, and female character dominant (or vice versa).Otherwise it comes across as being misandristic, and sadly it is incredibly overt in the first episode.

The Awful

(1) Roddenberry's dream and Star Trek was about exploration, and a better humanity, not driven by the acquisition of wealth, freeing itself of prejudice/racism. What drove humanity was the betterment of themselves and helping others and seeking knowledge. This did NOT come across.

I know this is a pilot, and things need to be ironed out. I want CBS and the writers (who I know will be under a lot of pressure) to continue to improve the show. My only suggestion is look at 'Battle of Axanar' on how to stay true to the concept of Star Trek but inject action into it. Battle of Axanar, a fan based short movie was infinitely better and than these two episodes. Please listen to the fans CBS....you stopped Axanar and fans producing what they wanted....but if you don't improve and listen to them, don't expect them to pay to watch it.",29 September 2017
"StarTrek used to be about strong characters that you could relate to. It used to be about showing us a BETTER world where we are move evolved, where we are the GOOD GUYS doing the RIGHT THINGS!. It was provocative, inspiring and had more moral than any religious book. And then they come with this crap! Evil warmongering violent unrelatable characters and loads of CGI and special effect to cover up for the fact that this show is just BORING! - Orville is gonna beat you guys - so fire the Action CGI idiots and hire Seth-Trek instead!!",6 October 2019
"As many already said, they spent 99% of the budget on production and 1% on story. It's so boring and so emotional, no Sci fi fan can enjoy it. It seems like they made this show to appeal to 15 year old teen age girls. Maybe that was their demographic, I don't know.

"Star Trek has less than a perfect track record, a franchise that has existed for half a century is going to make some alterations to stay relevant... That being said the core values have to be retained.

Star Trek Discovery is a bleak, miserable effort that has no understanding of what makes Star Trek so greatly loved. The franchise has always presented a positive message, peace through reason and maintaining composure in the face of adversity.

When core values are ignored all that remains is people whining at each other and space ships going 'pew pew'... no saving the day with logic, reasoning or understanding and no lessons learnt or truths discovered.

Gene Roddenberry would not endorse such vapid story telling, its all gloss, lens flares and fancy visuals. Star Trek Discovery is shambling, self important mess that seems to consider just turning up with the insignia and a few buzz words enough.",26 September 2017
"They have completely lost their way. This once venerable franchise has become little more than a vehicle for pushing a social agenda narrative. Tired, disappointing ... faux sci-fi. I gave it a season + part of an episode and it just never got out of its own way. The original Star Trek delivered good sci fi that quietly broke down a few barriers and delivered more than a few messages without being obvious. In contrast, Discovery could not be more obvious... and good sci-fi stories are the victim. I wish I could get back these hours back.",8 May 2019
"This movie is basically one long to do list. They say, this engine failed so this other backup engine needs to be started, this broke so we need to find a tool to fix it, they're gone so we need to beam them up, but there's geography in the way so we need to move here, on and on.... it's like a joke after a while. Is that what they think sci fi is? You just distract the people who bother to watch with a long laundry list of items for James T.? Oh, and they try to spice it up with the old... is so and so going to retire after this, and other stuff like that, which just feels like they're not even trying. This move should not be called Discovery, because the movie isn't about discovery, it's about movie tropes. Did they really say, we need a distraction, again? One thing I'll say positively, and why I gave it a few stars, is the graphics are beautiful. They're not the most creative I've ever seen, but they're done tastefully and what's there looks realistic. Also, the cast seems to know that this movie's plot is tiresome, and I get the impression from everyone that they're not too excited to be on set. Seems so often like the script writers are the weakest link on these movies. Can't we crowd source a script or something? Kind of like graphics have gotten better, can't the scripts get better, too?",15 October 2018
"Really?! It is some manifest with political cancer correction. It is really sad what they did with it. I would say that this is not a Star Trek at all.

"I love all in incarnations of star trek...... except this one. It just isnt trek. There are too many inconsistencies with what has gone on before, the obvious one being the Klingons. They look like something completely different, and they look stupid. yes the effects are good, but come on..... a star ship powered by mushrooms? Most of the main characters are just simpply annoying to watch, and nowhere in any of the hundreds of previous episodes of all the series did it hint that Spock had a sister. Its just laughable. Total garbage. I really wanted it to work, watched all of season one, and three episodes of season two, then I gave up. The Orville is a far better series and is what a modern version of trek should have been like. I wont be watching any more and if the new Picard series is along the same vein I wont be bothering with that either.",23 September 2019
"Wow what a fantastic first few episodes. The Klingons are so cool, way better even than TOS. The titles are great, the main character, this black half human Vulcan/human, a black female spock, is great, if obviously PC. Love her. All of its obvious flaws, such as pathetically PC characters, especially the loathsome and tedious Tilly, a pathetic whiny egocentric teenage cadet SJW, a parade of pseudo B list stars, a ton of weak and crap thinking is put to one side by the amazing Klingons and the more than good initial plot. But sadly it all goes to total nonsense and genuinely rubbish cheesy stupidity. It is so obvious,. one moment it good, the next you are like whaaaat that's dumb beyond belief. Truly a great show for about four or five episodes. Then, the worst star trek ever.",7 March 2018
"I really hoped for a good new Star Trek show but I had a feeling it will be bad...sadly I was right, show is really really bad. Why? Here's why: 1. Dumb plot 2. Terrible acting 3. Destroying the Klingons - this new species is just called the same but has nothing to do with real Klingons. 4. No Star Trek feeling present at all I wanted to write more but this show isn't worth it. If you are person of average smarts or higher, avoid this show at all costs.",24 November 2017

"Intrusive ongoing music backtrack makes it hard to hear speaking. The new Klingons are just either too scary or weird looking that you don't care if their entire world is obliterated into tiny particles. It wasn't necessary to have them speak Klingon for the entire first 2 episodes, especially for new watchers it will scare them off. Looks like the show will even out in episode 3 when they actually get onto the Discovery. I like the story telling and think the show can be saved. The production reminds me of The Expanse but The Expanse has much much better editing and killer sound. Crystal clear speaking and phenomenal tight handed editing. No music track obscuring the speaking parts. I hope they steady the series soon and compete with much better productions on SyFy, it has promise.",25 September 2017
"I can only suggest that the executive staff of this mess whip out their phone directories and call someone who actually has an idea what made Star Trek so special and great. Have some of them ever watched a single episode of TOS or TNG? I highly recommend to do so. What you will find there is more than exploding ships and lens flare generators. I will favor any slow-paced corridor only episode over your shallow space adventure. Your cast reminds me of the Star Wars prequels, they have almost the same level of character depth. You probably thought that you could just copy the J.J Star Trek Movies, and that people liked them for their visuals.. how about a little bit of market research.

"I can understand that most people love to feel they are being progressive and well-intended.

And its great those ideals are put forward in a show such as start trek. ST has always been progressive, and this should continue as it is.

But this is not why this show is bad.

This show is bad because the acting is hatrocious, the writing is childish, and most of the history and class of the ST series has been completely lost. Seriously, how many time a character can cry for no reason during an episode before we are authorised to jump out of the window, this is absolute madness.

I have watched everything, because I love ST, and the VFS in this show are letting us see the ST universe in a way rarely showned before. But I never listen to the dialogues. They are written for adolescents and immature adults, and are an insult to previous series.

They have lost perspective.",19 June 2021
"I like Star Trek. But this show is awful. I've only seen the first season so far, but its badddd. The show introduces unlikable characters then tosses them aside until they're convenient again. The male characters are blind and weak, the females are rewarded for bravery and ridged, but randomly emotional/break values. Michael is hard to like and is extremely emotional yet ""vulcan like"" when its convenient for the plot. The entire first season had so much potential, I actually got into it then the entire wrap up and finale was a major let down, filler like and completely off beat from the rest of the season. What is up with this show? How did they get more seasons? Also some of the acting made me wanna cry it was so weak.",26 November 2020

"Good photography is not enough to save a sustain a series when the writing is so preposterous. As someone who served in the military I have to say it - there is no military organization in the world that would have allowed Michael to continue to be a member. She's unstable, undisciplined & insubordinate - why would Star Fleet - or any army, navy or air force for that matter want such an egotistical liability with them in any capacity? She would've would up in the custody of the meatheads and courtmarshaled - military career game over. It is entirely possible she would have been sentenced to death. The character is so very un-relatable, unsympathetic it's neatly indescribable. She behaves like she should be under care of an endocrinologist and a psychiatrist. This make the series unwatchable from the beginning. On top of that the writers have made the lead a total Mary-Sue. No human behaves like the lead does as no human being is perfect at everything they do. I was excited for a female lead but the writers have completely dropped the ball on this thing. It's garbage.",7 February 2020
"I was dubious about this show from the initial teaser showing the ship and my opinion hasn't changed after watching the first season. There are so many things that they just did wrong. The rest of the TV shows at least kept some resemblance of continuity regarding events, races etc. This show, set after Enterprise and before the original series, is so far off base. The Klingons for example, wtf? Bares no resemble to any other series or movie (even the reboots got it close enough). This put me off the show in a big way. Characters - I can't even remember most of the characters names, there was nothing to connect with them. Storylines - They went for big and flashy but most lack substance. It's almost like everyone has their own take on the show, gets to write an episode but doesn't bother to try and make it relate to any other episode. The other shows had their stand alone episodes and story arcs but there was something about them that made the shows enjoyable to watch. This show, so far, doesn't seem to have that. The uniforms - Again, not keeping with the continuity of the franchise. Vaguely based on Enterprise jumpsuits. Would have been much better using the original series outfits.

The good things about the show:

The gay relationship is shown as it should be, a normal thing. The producers haven't made a song and dance about it as other shows do. The effects are great, shame about the set design and story let them down a bit. The mirror universe story line was nicely done.

I have hopes that the producers will have read the feedback about the show and make some major changes in Season 2. I would like to see more character development so that the characters are actually memorable. Hopefully see this fit in the cannon of the other shows more closely.",26 November 2018
"I can't say I'm biggest Trekkie But I'm a big fan of everything Science fiction. And I loved All 5 previous Star Trek shows and SG1, BSG, The X- files pretty much every big sci-fi franchise. But This Pilot is lackluster but That isn't even the issue for me.

TOS, TNG, DS9, Voyager and Even (partially) Enterprise all had it figured it out, We didn't need the best CGI. We need exciting storyline with lots ingenuity. These Pilot episodes are anything but that. This show had so much cliché It bored me to sleep, I stopped after the first episode and gone to bed. For this, I thank JJ Abrahams and its movies. Whoever Produced/Directed/wrote this ""thing"" should have known TV series have different dynamics than Movies. I can't see Trekkies following this and I can't see general Sci-fi fans following this every week, Hell I can't see a young audience who loves shallow JJ Abraham style movies following this every week.

A couple days ago/Before Release, Here We were hoping a good TV show, The TV Show that would change the current state of this genre. Because A couple reviewer gave it good reviews.

The Klingons. Why oh why redesign them? and where is that feeling they are truly warriors who holds honor high? They feel unintelligent, stupid and have a hard time to even speak.


Seriously - wtf are the producers, writers and everyone else involved in this show thinking!?!?

If you need a hint on what Star Trek is about, just watch one intro of ST TNG: Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the star ship Enterprise. Its continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.

"I just LOVE good escapist entertainment that draws me in and leaves me pumped up and wanting more! Unfortunately this series does not do that! It was a little uncomfortable at first, but then become more and more painful; sort of like what might be expected from an infection often referred to by the first letters of the words in the title, ""Star Trek Discovery"". I wanted very much to love this series, but the writing is terrible. It disappointingly yields a result that is far less than mediocre, to put it kindly. The crying and over the top emotionalism, combined with feeble story lines, and an increasing focus on sloppy, drippy wokeness, woven more and more into the storyline, particularly in season 3, is much more than distracting and disappointing. It is an insult to what Star Trek is, and what this series could be and should be! It has become more than I can stomach! It is just sickening! I endured to the end of the 3rd season, but I simply have no desire to come back for more punishment!

"I liked everything about Discovery.

Bearing in mind that I rarely have time to watch TV (an hour or two a month, usually), if I choose to spend that time watching a show, it's because I'm invested or at the very least, find it quite entertaining.

I liked the diversity, the frankness and the real human interactions. I loved that they embraced so many cultures and social groups, even if at times it seemed quite ""preachy"". I loved that one of my best friends - a trans woman - finally feels represented in mainstream TV.

But most of all, I really enjoyed the storylines.

But the decision to remove Discovery from Netflix and move it to paramount, requiring us to sign up to yet another subscription service, was a bare-faced, greedy, cynical and manipulative cash grab too far. It was a very American thing to do: upset people around the world out of greed and thoughtlessness.

Consequently, this is the point that Discovery and I part company. Hey ho, I think I'll invest in a European show next time round, as the Europeans don't tend to pull this kind of stupid stunt.",21 November 2021

That was Roddenberry's's vision, on top of just being political, Star Trek pushes boundaries, always did, great! I don't even have an issue paying for CBS all access if the show was even mildly good, However, this show is HORRIBLE.

Most of this series has nothing in common with star trek. It should be renamed or bring back captain Pike. Those Pike episodes were thematically closest and the most enjoyable.

There is some superb characters such as. Lt Cmdr Pail, Tilly, Booker & Tig for example but for some reason the writers keep deciding to focus on the Michael Brunham character who is cold, annoying and self centered, far away from the true meaning of Star Trek. It ruins the whole flow of the show and I personally think the whole series would be better off without her.

The more the series is proceeding the more obvious everything is becoming.

With the character Michael its like Star Trek with a added depressant, the whoel mood is somber and miserable and not enjoyable to watch. Hopefully the writers will sort it out in future episodes. I watch Star Trek for escapism from the realities not to make me feel more stressed or depressed.

Some of the stand alone episodes without Michael are great but its so hard to like a program when the captian of the crew is so unlikeable.",2 August 2022

It's as if we have actually achieved, in reality, the plot-line of so many ""Mirror' universe episodes throughout the Star Trek universe. An EVIL Federation, with an EVIL Captain, and an EVIL agenda. Utterly antithetical to everything that 'Star Trek' represents.... Another appalling disgrace from hellywood's hopelessly deluded liberals. Not original, Not revolutionary, NOT thought-provoking, just BAD, BAD, BAD ! 'Discovery' is a disgrace to humanity along with the lesser crime of being an insulting disgrace to the vaunted Star Trek universe.",3 October 2020

"After watching 5 episodes I would rate this show as Z E R O, and can only say this:

This show is an embarrassment of Star Trek philosophy, it is everything that Star Trek is NOT, it defiles the purity of Star Trek world, and it desecrates all the graves of all brilliant minds that are no longer with us, and that have participated in creation of Star Trek series, Star Trek movement, Star Trek community and philosophy of living in an futuristic better world.

Gene Roddenberry is turning in his grave now.

"I was so afraid that I wasn't gonna like the show, and that they would ruin the star trek franchise.. but they didn't. This IS star trek. A trek that warms the heart of all trekkies by giving us mystery, good acting and a powerful storyline, a trek that's modern to the present and still gives us the star trek feeling that we want, an amazingly clever and original nain title, Stunning special effects....After a few minutes of watching I was hooked. Don't get me wrong, I still love ds9, voyager and tng more :p, because I grew up with them. But Discovery has something different, everything fits well together and it feels great. Looking forward to the next episodes I hope that the rest of the season is consistent with the beginning. A Trek for all ages <3

"After so much conflict about whether I like enough of the show to say I like the show and whether I hate enough parts of the show to say Paramount needs to be sued by Gene Roddenberry's estate, I'm going to simply say this:

""Star Trek"" Discovery has obvious elements of Star Trek in it. However, its biggest issue is still that it's a giant continuity error. One of the reasons I'm a die-hard ""trekkie"" over my love for Star Wars and Marvel is the simple fact that Star Trek never answered everything with the ""another timeline/universe"" token, though JJ Abram's movies pushed the envelope, being saved simply by awesome effects and the realistic theory of the Butterfly Effect.

Discovery also incorporates ideas that aren't at all Star Trek related which makes it a show that I've vowed at first never to watch, but not vow never to return to after watching it all the way through once. It's not worth anything to me and in the end, I wish they would destroy any record of its existence. From what I understand, the actors typically earn up to a certain amount of royalties until a cap, so ultimately no harm would come from their hard work. Just less harm to a once flawless franchise.

The only thing I liked about this show are the weapons and a select few characters.

If you're a progressive younger generation looking for a ripped-off sci-fi universe including the most up-to-date inappropriate ""inclusive"" ideas using the ""Star Trek"" branding in its title, this is the right show for you. Also, the majority of people that support this show appear to simply be those of a newer generation using this as their excuse to get introduced to Star Trek. This means they will never have a proper introduction to the real franchise, may it RIP.

If older, wiser people were able to use the internet more with their own voices, this show would have half the stars it does.",21 October 2021
"After watching the first 4 episodes, I throw in the towel and stop here! Poor acting, incoherent scripts and mind-numbing dialogues. And all the spirituality and mysticism, does not belong on Star Trek. It's so heart breaking to see the franchise I loved so much during my childhood be transformed into an empty shell. This is a bad Star Wars story disguised as Star Trek.

If you are a Star Trek fan, watch Orville instead. It is much closer to the spirit of the original series, plus has better acting, better dialogue and better script.",14 November 2017

"Well produced overall, this series is beautifully designed and enjoys the benefit of modern special effects. I would love to complain about the romance, and the human/family stories, but I suppose these were intentional changes to appeal to somewhat different markets. People do love daytime dramas. More importantly, what's with all the crying? It's not just specifically the crying, but all of the emotional dumping that goes with it. Originally, I think of Star Trek as all about adventure, exploration, the thirst for knowledge, voyaging into an infinite unknown universe. Not boo hoo my parents didn't love me enough. Overall I enjoyed the series, just feel a little deceived by the Star Trek name up front. Maybe they could call it Star ""Journey of Personal Emotional Development""?",11 September 2020

Everything else is at least entertaining.",7 October 2017
"Meh is about all I can say. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. The Klingons certainly didn't look like Klingons, and the similarity of a bridge crew name grated on my nerves because it was so close to an original Star Trek character. The camera angles were kinda distracting off and on. Dialog wasn't great. The situation in the pilot was way over the top in my opinion. I know they were hoping to hook people into trying out the CBS All Access subscription by leaving you hanging till the next episode. Fortunately, it wasn't good enough to make me even think about doing that. I'll go buy a latte. I'll enjoy it more.",25 September 2017

"Unfortunately the problem is that the past 10 years has largely been spent moving Star Trek away from it's core fanbase, and in to the visual field of people who like to watch Marvel movies and then go home and get on with their lives.

Clearly this takes something away from tens, if not hundreds of millions of fans over these last 50 years who have grown up with the moral principals woven in to the fabric of Star Trek.

I'm not entirely sure what is driving the writers and producers to go in this direction, but I do suspect it's probably due to being promised a large pay packet for bringing in the Marvel audience.

To put it lightly, we feel as if you've taken something that's been tightly woven in to the people we are, defecated on it, and then propose to charge us to see the end result in the hope that it's not entirely covered in your droppings.

Star trek is not, and has never been an action adventure fantasy romp. You've stolen all of the proper nouns, graphics, props and virtually every in-universe memorial and thrown it at the wall.

Nothing you baboons have made makes any sense. We've got iconic sound effects and design from every star trek series appearing hundreds of years before they were ever shown like a war escapee on a sound board after too much coffee (created by much loved Trek alumni).

We've got you slapping in-universe iconography like the Federation Delta badge all over every single damned piece of equipment gratuitously (just to remind us that this is in no way anything to do with Star Trek). Do none of these goons know that the Delta didn't come in to use until after Kirk's 5 year mission? Are we all a bunch of cretinous assholes for pointing all this stuff out? Will you equally turn against other viewers when they too begin to see the real inconsistencies in the generic crap you're writing?

We've got iconic characters and races being present in name only. And by the looks of it, we've got a writer's room full of generic writers and producers who are so far removed from Star Trek and it's fanbase that they can't even get it right with Memory Alpha at their fingertips.

They see Star Trek as an action adventure series and cash cow, with zero grounding in science and/or astrophysical theory, morality plays or indeed a shred of human compassion. All the characters are assholes too. If that's what the future has in store with these greedy pigs heading up senior positions in the franchise it has absolutely no chance.

It's never been some rancid Marvel rip off, and we all know they are not the type of people who enjoy philosophical morality plays reaching out to a different person, culture or personality each week, a different social issue tackled, or a racial issue, or morality issues. In that case it has absolutely no fucking idea what Star Trek is.

You don't spend 50 years building up a fanbase on that bases to then throw them all into a dumpster fire, and charge everyone to get through the paywall so they can watch us all burn.

Every time someone tries to screw with the 60 yearold formula they make big changes to the ingredient to put their own stamp on it, and then wonder why no one is interested in the burnt and tasteless cake they offer to people.

You're all money hungry assholes without a slither of understanding about what Star Trek means, and it will be your undoing.",24 December 2017

"I really hate to add to the star trek discovery hate on here but..... I am on season 3 like everyone else here and feeling much the same as everyone on here. What is going on with this series?

1) It should definitely be called Star Trek Burnham. Talk about lack of other character driven stories.

2) What is with the swearing? How does this add value or reflect the ideology of the federation and its representation of the highest standards required to be part of a starship crew. This really gets my goat. If I had kids I would have been totally disappointed for them to have seen or heard that from a franchise that's lasted decades without the F word.

3) Where is the realism that we can relate to.There is so much unnecessary CGI. Why do they need a dissolving and reappearing walkway? How about that reassembling somersault ship scene that Books ship did when Bernham rescued him. Get real. Too far fetched even for 900 years in the future. Impossible. Just because we can do amazing things with CGI doesn't mean we should all the bloody time.

And how about Discovery's unique spin drive instant zap across the universe. Gee I liked it just fine when these ships had to fight with engines to get the warp drive going to outrun Borg. And Jordi would be sweating into that visor or Trip would be watching sparks flying in the engine room and smoke pouring everywhere. Now we just spin and bam we're across the galaxy!! ....... borrrrring.

When you watch Enterprise, TNG, Voyager, the stories, the characters, The plot draw you in to the show quickly. Then the effects enhance the story and help to propel the story forward adding to the believability. Discovery does it backwards using tech and special FX first. That's really sad, it's too difficult to relate to much of anything on the show.

The things that are good are Saroo. He is honorable and optimistic. That's about it.

I love Sci-Fi and could watch it all day long but they have skipped over so much that made the trek franchise great. Sorry but time for a reboot.

I don't blame the actors. I do think everyone is trying on this show but there appears to be a serious disconnect on what is actually tying to be achieved here or perhaps they are trying to do too many things at once and it's pulling this show apart.

One thing it does do is make all the old trek series look fantastic and appreciate the effort that went into making great and entertaining episodes with wonderful plots, loveable characters and villans, and cool ships.",6 December 2020
I was checking everyone's views about this series but first 3-4 pages everyone give 1 or 2 stars out of 10. Then why its 7.4????!,10 June 2019
"This new incarnation of Star Trek is almost as bad as the Jar Jar Abrams Star Trek movies. Its constantly going at 100 miles an hour, forgoing character development and decision making for explosions, impulsiveness, lens flare, and a forced equality narrative that no one really cares for. While the original series and TNG addressed racism and sexism, they did so by making equality the norm, to where the viewer is exposed to it and accepts it based on the merits of the characters portrayed. This series makes it a plot point to force the equality message without developing any characters in the journey. Even CBS touts the show as a progressive platform for equality. Since when was that the selling point of Star Trek? If you want to see good science fiction, I would recommend The Orville or Black Mirror: USS Callister (which may be getting its own series). Lets hope the pendulum swings back to the middle soon, so any future sci-fi shows can do what they were intended. To explore new worlds and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before.",30 January 2018

To boldly go where no one has gone before. And for the love of Spock, stop crying. Every 5 minutes someone is crying. This is supposed to be the best crews on these Starships.

It is effect overload with headache inducing camera work.

"Uh oh!

STD is a colossal and massively transparent cash grab made by intellectual property squatting assclowns who have never sat through a season of Star Trek in their lives.

Now we have a generic Hero's journey (google it) in star trek too. Why would CBS bring in producers only capable of such crap? Looks like the boys and girls running this thing have failed to understand that continuity is what makes star trek believable and cohesive over half a century in it's many forms. It's what keeps decades of fans onboard as it adapts to the modern day in a believable and progressive way, while also linking us all together. The cardinal rule is that they never, ever rewrite anything, because that obliterates the carefully curated universe that countless hundreds of individuals have spent their lives crafting a legacy so carefully to fit into what had come before. You rewrite that, and you've lost us.

I truly struggle to understand how the writers and producers of this garbage wondered into the franchise, and the intentions of those who put them there. This is catastrophic to Star Trek, it's fanbase, primarily because we're mostly intelligent people with a good understanding and interest in science, and who have no interest whatsoever in an action space romp. It is as if Trek was sold off to the lowest bidder, for the most mediocre of IQ.

In the eyes of 95% of Star Trek fans, you failed big time and let us all down because you have undeniably killed off something we loved and made a part of who we are, and I shall never support these producers or actors again.

"As a fan of the franchise who grew up with it since the first broadcasts in the 60's, this latest iteration doesn't ring true. It seems that the writers, direction and production have take the brand and attempted to update it for a contemporary audience but lost the sense of what the original Star Trek was about.

It doesn't help that some aspects of the new show are so politically 'in-your-face' obvious that they make me squirm. Perhaps the writers are just too young to understand that you can't replace thoughtful plots, stories and characters with superficial nods to current movements. The imbalance between male and female characters and the fact that nearly everyone appears to be 28 to 34 years of age and lifted from a modelling agency is both sexist and ageist. It's insulting to say the least.

Luckily, I recently discovered Seth McFarlane's newish series, The Orville. In comparison, he's retained all the feeling of Star Trek (albeit with twisted humour) and managed to create stories that are actually quite serious. As a fan, I love it.

I'm forced to give ST Discovery 1/10, if just to acknowledge that it keeps the brand alive. But man-o-man, it's so sad what this generation thinks is good enough to put all that production money into.",12 February 2019

However, this nauseating mish-mash of technology, profanity and ever-present confusion as it was eloquently described by earlier reviewers is not fit to be recommended to normal adults - let alone children. Star Trek has always been about shaping a society of forward looking, positive explorers of humanity and space. This show is failing to do this by instead focusing on disorder, ongoing conflict and fear which are seeping in through every episode.

For me, being a fan of the classic Trek series like TNG, DS9, VOY, ENT _and_ the new Picard series (!), in comparison Discovery was clearly the loser, the worst show! Not everything was bad, but way too much. For me it was actually quite boring, the story, the whole show couldn't get me. The characters were mostly flat and some even stupid, like Tilly who was misplaced (would better fit in a comedy or sitcom). For me, the absolute focus on Burnham was one of the biggest mistakes! Her character seemed strange and I couldn't identify, not even really liked her. Classic series offered spotlight for _different_ characters, which I find a much better way!

"For me, ""Star Trek Discovery"" is the worst Star Trek series ever made. This is due to the completely unnerving actors on the one hand and the really miserable story on the other. Actors who are constantly annoying when they appear, such as this red-haired childlike chatterbox, then this leading actress Michael, self-confident, arrogant and opinionated that every spectator perishes. And the behavior of many Darstzeller is childishly annoying and everyone after the ""Let's hug a round"" mode. Intolerable do-gooder syndrome. And that in the 23rd century? If I take these authentic, credible and serious actors from ""Star Trek Next Generation"" as a comparison, for example, they don't even come with 1% in the performance. And then the story? Which untalented author wrote this story? Please never again! Boring mushrooms - spores? From place to place in space, um, in front of Kirk / Picard - Enterprise (why couldn't they?) And then the Klingons! Auwei! To run away. So embarrassing. Why don't you just leave the Klingons with their hair, skin tone, as well as the Romulans etc. in Next Generation? I don't understand. It has nothing to do with Star Trek anymore. And then a story of a sister from Spock appears. As a planned story - impulse to somehow make the whole thing bearable. Just? Why have you never heard a word from a supposed sister in all the decades? Commander Pike, who appears in season 2 and at least somehow reminds of the old flair, can be one of all these disastrous childish actors (""Come, I hug you!"") Or five times heroically embarrassing ""We are the Starfleet!"" and really feel sorry for a bad story.

Sometimes I wish that she would just say something without scrunching up her face in one of the innumerable expressions in her repertoire.

My main issue, & I realise the actor are still trying to find their feet with their character, but the show feels very cheap, very fan made. The dialogue is terrible. The CGI looks duty, dark & cheap. I'm not particularly fond of the lady that does the voice of the computer or the over use of it. I don't like the theme tune. It should of been more of a fanfare. I'm fed up with the focus on trying to mimic or staying true to TOS. They made this mistake with Enterprise, trying to capitalise on the success of first contact with far too many references. I'm not a fan of story arks. Find like the dominion war, it dragged out. It was lazy writing. At least with TNG there was a stand alone fresh story every week. I'm concerned this will be the case here with the Klingons. It's dragging out. It's going to end up like Star Gate universe. All suspense with a massive anticlimax. I'm not impressed with the new look or sound of the Klingons. They sound like they're gargling when they talk. I don't understand why 2 British actors are playing American character.

Many people talk about how overly ""liberal"" the show is in casting a female lead or two. I don't know what's wrong with those people. Let's be perfectly clear here: there is absolutely nothing wrong with having a female lead, a black or Asian lead, etc. But I have two gripes with how the main character was set up: (1) she's far too young. I hate when they do this. JJ did it in the Star Trek movies, too, by picking Chris Pine to play a captain. Can't we have someone for these roles who seems like they really could fit in that role? Why do you have to cast babies? (2) she's far too white-ish. If you're going to hire a black person, please, let her just be a normal black person.

From the network the gave us a lesbian romance on their Family channell on CHRISTMAS DAY 2012 comes their version of Star Trek. They've touched all the bases from gay to evironmental doom. I hug bunnies and trees like the next person and a person' orientation is none of my business....but come on guys..this is Star Trek. Lines are barely deviverable..need more rehearsing. music, graphics are all 3rd rate. These guys are way too advanced for a pre Kirk timeline, and this whole business of a microbial thread holding the universe together getting threatened ....well. speaks for itself. Klingons?? they look like the alien in Enemy Mine not Warf. Thank goodness I didnt use up my free week....removed the channel from my Roku and the all from all devices.",8 August 2018
"Maybe having a different director for every episode isn't really helping the fact that the acting is dire and it feels like a series on a budget, very C grade. The scripts are cringe worthy and i do hope this series get's back on track....sooner rather than later.",23 February 2019
"Wow never thought it would happen but this so called series of Star Trek is really bad the completely opposite (nihilistic, pessimistic , depressing, repudiation and the absence of moral values ) to Gene Roddenberry's vision (to and want for) his Star Trek (optimistic, brave, heroic, hopeful, encouraging, good moral values) the show like the Star Wars series under Disney (TLJ and Solo) has been subverted (perverted) and like SW seems to be an attempt to negate (cancel out) the entire series that made it (and SW) great",20 February 2019
"Nice sound and image, I can tell it's not a small budget show. But, man, so much emotion, crying and interpersonal relations. It's more like a soap opera in space. I was hoping for a TNG style series with a lot of science and exploration. Might be interesting for millennials but not for me. I'm disappointed.",5 November 2020
"In my opinion this will fail because it lacks the central idea that made the 1st 2-3 series successful: the look into the future, not the look into the past. Instead of going forward this series tries to explain inventions in TNG or Voyager etc. Instead of having a million possibilities, you have to fight with the klingons and then make friends with them, invent the Federation, etc. I really hope I am wrong",22 September 2017
"I love star trek series (original, next generation, enterprise, deep space nine) but to have a company blatantly take a beloved series and use it just to make money by forcing anyone that wants to watch this to buy a tv subscription they can forget that. I won't ever support such a practice. I would suggest everyone avoid this or else it will just lead to all tv channels creating their own fee based subscription service and that will be the end of free tv which is already dying with all that reality tv crap that the networks have been producing over the last 10 year. Better to just read a book.",21 January 2019
"I love Star Trek and really wanted to watch this. Wow was I disappointed! I couldn't bear to watch past the middle of the sixth episode. Some ships have a familiar shape, and there are Vulcans and phasers and (alleged) Klingons, but names and computer graphics do not a Star Trek make.

One of the secrets of Star Trek and good sci-fi is it's always about the people and human problems, not the science. So never, ever delve too far into the science, because you'll always miss the mark. And wow, do they miss it, combining some of the strangest ideas into a hodgepodge

Another rule of good writing is to never violate the established tenets of the universe you're operating in. If you do, your audience will reject the story because it violates what they already ""know"" to be true. This destroys willing suspension of disbelief over and over and over until you can't immerse yourself in the story. This series is a perfect example of this problem.

For example, they introduce new technologies and new ship behaviors (counter-rotating saucers??) and new looks and behaviors of species like Klingons and clashing timelines in a confusing jumble that is impossible fit into the existing Star Trek universe.

The writers and directors takes themselves way too seriously, focusing screen time on flashy graphics and cool gadgetry rather than actual intelligent interactions, until the plot is hard to remember and enjoy.

The interactions of lead characters are deeply frustrating because they are so consistently illogical. Several times every episode, your brain screams out some reasonable reply to some misunderstanding, but do they ever utter that obvious answer? No! The main character (and everyone else) continues to walk down a path of illogic so bad that it immediately reminds you that you are watching a horribly weak script. Soon, it's impossible to relate to the thoughts and emotions of the characters. You end up not even caring how anything turns out.

I did manage to start enjoying the series a little bit when I pretended that I wasn't watching Star Trek anymore. That allowed me to ignore the inconsistencies. But then the other directing and writing and graphics excesses took over and continued to make me hate what I was saying, until I had to stop watching.

In the end, I canceled my CBS all access pass and appreciated the time I was saving.",1 December 2019
It's just sad. Since season 1 I knew it's going to be disastrous yet I tried my best to keep an open mind and my expectation of it were low... But holy Fkuc. Did the writers and producers hate star trek so much that they combined all their efforts to destroy everything while they still can?,26 February 2021
"Every other scene has glaringly obvious plot holes, any form of continuity is out the window. ""We're picking up the energy signature of a cloaked Klingork ship entering the system, we must now do 122 mushroom jumps so we can detect cloaked Klingork ships.."" Your level of intelligence has to be pretty low to write such rubbish, much less watch it without throwing anything at the TV.

This is the worst type of low brow fan fiction on a studio budget. Clearly someone has sold out Star Trek rights to people who have no idea what Star Trek is. I can't begin to fathom why anyone would want to be involved in such an abject failure from the outset.

Stupid is as stupid does. If you create a show full of inconsistent plot holes, you're only going to get an inconsistent audience who are neither fans of science, or science fiction. You've just got another marvel TV show with Trek branding slapped all over it for naked profiteering.

This is not only an insult to the loyal fandom at large (who rightly can't and won't stand for it), but also to everyone who has worked on Trek over 50 years of continuity and world building, only to have it thrown away like a used diaper and replaced with a sub par imitation of it's namesake made for a completely different and largely uninterested audience.

CBS have bought the farm with this, the fandom will never trust them again.",26 August 2018
Everybody is speaking half whispering. Emotional music running non stop. Tears flowing all the time. It's like a bad soap opera in space. I mean the special effects are amazing. But the characters and the acting is horrible. It's so melodramatic over the top with how emotional everyone is acting. Somehow it's getting worse and worse with every episode.,27 November 2020
Im done with star trek. The people at cbs have created a third gen klingon race that is pathetic. Not only have the destroyed the klingon culture they have destroyed the federation. Best of luck to the douche bag writers that took the one thing i enjoyed as an escape and turned it into a piss poor statment on society.,18 February 2018
"The problems with the show will be written about at length by others, all I'll say is that the show doesn't fit in the same universe as the earlier Star Trek shows and is best viewed as a separate continuity.

One thing I did think was interesting was the way T'Kuvma articulated the Klingon view of the Federation, it says it comes in peace but in reality it's an existential threat to the Klingon way of life. I'm not sure how much the writers intended it to be the case but this actually echos very clearly Islamist views of the West and Liberal Democracy.

The other parallel is with the theme of reuniting the Klingon Empire, more than one Muslim (usually Arab) leader has talked about the need to reunite some form of caliphate as a way to combat Western values and political power.

It'll be interesting to see how they manage to show both sides of the conflict and to what degree the audience may find itself in sympathy with the Klingons, I think there is some real potential there.",25 September 2017
"It is always a bit hard to judge a series after its pilot, so I will give Star Trek Discovery the benefit of the doubt and watch a couple more episodes the coming weeks. However, as a huge Star Trek fan I can say: ""This is not Star Trek""

By the way, the short for Star Trek Discovery is STD and I'm starting to see a pattern here!

OK then, let's free ourselves from the notion that this is supposed to be Star Trek and rate it as a SciFi series in general. Well, looking at it from this perspective is not making it any better.

It is an action series, but it is a quite bad one (for now). I don't know whether the expectations of quality for a good action series has gone down over the last couple of years, but the action scenes are very rapidly cut, bright and therefore confusing. There are a gazillion different light effects and explosions on screen at a time, so you cannot really determine what is actually happening. Space seems to be quite colorful these days, as if Andy Warhol and Picasso were part of the design department.

In essence they just combined the lens-flare style filming introduced and beaten to death by J.J. Abrams and then put some Michael Bay in there to make it great pile of ehm... lets use the word confusion to keep the language clean.

The story (until now) is pretty basic and nothing jaw-dropping, but I will not go into that, because I do not want to add spoilers to this review. Let's just say that the emotional roller-coaster some of the characters display is neither warranted nor comprehensible after just having been introduced to them.

What baffles me most is that with The Expanse, there is a fantastic and quite good SciFi series out there, which in my opinion shows how SciFi is supposed to be in the 21st century. Political, criticizing social structures and a bit of well made action here and there. So, I don't understand how and why they screwed this one up so much, as Star Trek would be primed to be a show that combines elements from other currently popular formats, like Game of Thrones, House of Cards and guess what even Star Trek, because it always was not only about some crew flying around space and shooting stuff, but about current and universal politics, social problems and so on and so forth. And it is not as if they did not have the money to actually pull off something like that.

Unless this show evolves like a butterfly during its first season I have little hope for it getting any better.",26 September 2017
"Star Trek has never been as good as we remember it. It's always been a little campy, cheesy, and dependent on technobabble to drive the plot. It's also always been the optimistic critic of our social shortcomings and pushed boundaries. So having someone in the back row groaning about getting whale extinction shoved down their throat when they just want to watch Star Trek is not new.

But this wokeness-turned-to-11 endeavor never develops any charm. The characters are all not that compelling; it's like the Bad News Bears was the inspiration for the crew. The amount of violence was excessive for no real purpose. I don't see how a ""24"" season-arc approach brings any value in the Star Trek universe. If you like an episode story telling format, this is not your show at all.

Clearly the people that created this vision for Star Trek were not listening to anyone that wanted to steer it back to what the franchise meant to anyone else. It seems like they had specific story telling goals in mind and Star Trek just became the vehicle for their ideas. I'm done with it, I can't watch them abuse the franchise and I especially won't pay for it.",18 February 2018
"The first series, the third and fourth seasons cause vomiting.

Clichés, templates, lack of logic and sequence of actions are off the charts. The main character can be mad, inconsistent, do not respect other people's opinions, solely because of her own emotional needs or moral compass, and this is shown to us as a necessity for the hero of the galaxy! And for each of her exploits, she is thanked, and loudly and on the whole screen!

I went into it with an open mind, and tried to forget about all the negative things I had heard about it. I could not even make it through the first episode of this show. It was so slow moving and uninteresting it made my head hurt. The whole time I was watching I kept telling myself, ""forget about old Star Trek and just enjoy this for what it is. Overlook the inconsistencies Discovery has with past Star Trek."" Sorry to say though, I could not do it. The show just wasn't for me. I cancelled my ""free trial"" of All access two hours after signing up. Avoid this turd at all cost.",13 February 2018
I love Star Trek and over the years have watched it all (even Deep Space Nine) but this is so bad I had to give up during season 2.

Special effects are top notch but at the cost of narrative and some promising story lines that end up having zero payoff. I was so looking forward to seeing this and after the first episode i felt empty and confused. Season 2 is less of a travesty but its just a super visual action dumbed down show which is not what Star Trek is supposed to be.",27 March 2019
"I have been waiting a very long time for a new Star Trek series, and I decided I would try to watch Discovery with an open mind, accepting the fact that this new series will likely aim to entice a new audience. I accepted it would need to be a little different and modernised from the classic Trek of the 90s that I'm used to, so I went in with this in mind.

I started watching, but after getting 7 episodes in, I literally cannot stand anymore of it. It's not only different to the earlier series, but it seems to completely miss the point of what Star Trek is all about. I was hoping to see Star Trek getting back to its roots of exploration, questioning the Human condition, presenting moral dilemmas, intriguing story plots and aspiring to a better future for humanity, but so far all I have seen is more lens flare, CGI, lame stories, fancy explosions and characters I can't help but feel I want to personally strangle to death. It's really just an action flick in space with very minimal reference or appreciation for the rich and diverse universe that is Star Trek, except in name only. I would even go as far as asking if the creators of Discovery have ever seen Star Trek before.. I'm not even kidding.

If you enjoy action and sci-fi full stop, then you might enjoy Discovery. But if you're looking for a Star Trek come back, I fear you will be as disappointed as I am, in which case I recommend watching The Orville.

I give Discovery 4/10 -- the CGI and filming is excellent, and there's certainly no shortage of action, but it is severely lacking in pretty much every other aspect.",30 October 2017

"While the series says Star Trek in the title, this isn't what you'd expect or even want from a Star Trek series. Star Trek was always about relationships and ethical questions. This is just a flashy action series with Star Trek inspired uniforms. The Klingons don't look like Klingons, their ships, not even close.

This series has reminded me more of Mass Effect. While Mass Effect was great, it wasn't Star Trek, it was inspired by it, but it just wasn't that.

If you want something that they should've made, look at Prelude to Axanar. It's fan made, but holy damn, it's good.",25 September 2017

So the logical thing for me to do is, put this into the category of ""SHOULD NEVER HAVE EXISTED"" along with Indiana Jones 4 & matrix sequels.",11 November 2017
"I knew Season 3 was going to suck when La Burnum returned more annoying than ever with a saccharine sidekick with a cat. Well, at least Georgiou was still around to kick ass and deliver a captivating performance and Reno was still around to throw out the best one-liners. Unfortunately, Tilly, Stamets and Culber were also still around. The character of Tilly is ridiculous and unbelievable - Wiseman's talent is wasted here; she always seems to be trying to rise above the stupidity of her role. Stamets and Culber are annoying to the nth degree: one with a perpetual expression like a constipated cow and the other with a fake smile and an irritating voice. Both characters are superfluous.

Since its inception, Discovery has perpetuated the practice of introducing interesting plot lines with characters played by good actors , only to wipe the slate clean and add new, inferior plots , characters and actors. Those characters who have survived this last season (with the exception of the excellent ensemble of the bridge crew and Reno) are the worst, not the best, and the new characters added - Adira and her/his multi-dimensional boyfriend/girlfriend - simply plays into one of the worst conceits of all the Star Trek series: the ubiquitous angst-ridden teenager. Adding yet more totally unnecessary characters and side-stories only strains the skills of writers who can barely create a sustain a cohesive story arc.

Since season 1, Discovery has suffered from an identity crisis, and season three has only managed to plunge it further into virtual psychosis.

If Discovery is to survive with dignity, it needs to ditch the dead wood characters , bad actors and tired ideas and concentrate on a focused plot with an end game in site - as was done so with Voyager.",9 January 2021
"Garbage. I do not understand the current rating of 7.3. I fully understand that it is hard to make sci-fi movies or series, but this is bad.

I could, until now, say that Star Trek was the best franchise because the it maintained the science fiction spirit with good or somewhat OK stories. All reiterations so far had been alright, albeit some better than others, but this is sh!t.

I love some of the actors (some not so much), but they can't make up for the bad writing.

In all honesty, ""The Orville"" spoof is better, even with the comedic overlay. For example the episode ""Majority rule"" is not a bad story.

Anyways, I opened an account on IMDb just to cast my vote.

Especially impossible with our daughter and nephew. Reading about the upcoming episodes (if we would have done that originally we never would have headed down this path, but who would have thought we'd have to with the Star Trek universe) it's obvious this show is targeting those corrupted and desensitized by the amoral world of video games and blatantly degenerate film studios.

I held out hoping this season would be better, but it's worse. Normally, I am up for reruns. At least that's how's it's been with most Star Trek series. Not with seasons 1 and 2, I did not watch reruns. I couldn't stomach seeing Burnham over and over with the same pedantic garbage.

"Session 1 was a misfire but it was watchable.

Season 2 Found its footing and became a pretty good show!

Season 3 starts out with promise, introducing a charismatic swashbuckling character (Book) then moving away from him. Just like they did with Lorca (and Pike's crew for that matter. Maybe that spin-off show will be less pretentious).

At this point, this show is just unwatchable. It's awful. I have read some hate about Burnham, but I disagree. I actually like Michael Burnham's character.

The problem is she's the only crewmember worth watching. If they killed every single other member of Discovery, NO ONE WOULD CARE. (Possible Exception: Georgiou)

Honestly, most people probably wouldn't care much if they killed Burnham off either.

The show honestly just doesn't care if we care. I don't know where they dug up the writers for this slop, but every time they blindly stumble upon a character anyone would care about, they promptly remove them and bring us back to this garbage crew. Honestly it's just condescending to keep feeding the dedicated audience such trash.

Let me save you a bunch of time. If you are going to watch this show, skip seasons one and three. Watch season two if you must, and hold out for the spinoff featuring Captain Pike's crew.

Voyager was not saved until they brought in 7 of 9 - who saved the series. But they kept the whining Mulgrew even though no one wanted to see her on the screen. The Burnham character is much the same - she is a whiner, who wants to cry herself into saving the crew.

Although I am a Star Trek fan, I did my best to ensure that I wouldn't judge it based upon feelings of nostalgia nor judge it by comparing it to Star Trek television series of the past. That being said I really don't know what to think.

The only thing that was particularly bad was the Klingon design (they really messed that up). And yet the only thing that was particularly good was the visuals. Everything else was shockingly average or below average.

I found myself not caring about any of the main characters, if the show creators attempted to give depth to the main character (First Officer Michael Burnham) through flashbacks, they pretty much failed. I found myself annoyed by the character more than anything else and by adding the different angles in an attempt to make the audience sympathetic or interested in her, all their achieved was to make her an emotionally compromised over-compensator(yes I am aware that isn't a word) with a chip on her shoulder.

The federation characters other than the green eyed alien were very bland, especially the captain, which shouldn't be happening. And the interactions between said characters were either irrelevant or annoying.

The only group I found myself respecting was the Klingons interestingly enough, even though I was practically opposed to what they represented ideologically and spiritually in this adaption. If the show creators were attempting to make a show where the lines between ""thuh good guise and da bad guise"" was slightly more blurred: they succeeded. Somehow I don't think that was the case, however (someone please prove me wrong).

The whole flow felt rushed, not a lot, but that feeling persisted. You can expect that in a standalone movie, but not in the first-impressions pilot of a new television series.

I'll keep watching it in the hopes that it gets better, but they need to give legitimate depth to the main character and the others quickly or I have a feeling I will become disgruntled quite quickly, and if I am to compare this increasingly to the previous adaptions (which I will try to avoid and probably end up failing) my patience and score might drop.

A generous 5/10.",25 September 2017
"They got so many things wrong that i can't see it as a Star Trek series. I was really looking forward to see it but the more i saw, the more it felt like something else than the Star Trek i love. This is neither the Star Trek we wan't, nor the Star Trek we need.",29 December 2018
"Everything started to be okey from episode 1 to 4. I am not anti-gay or whatever but I was hoping that this TV show won't concentrate on this propaganda to force people to get use on gay relationships. They should be respected and same with others too, try to be sensitive a bit for both straight and gays, try not to get too involve on this stuff. I was hoping for better Star Trek but the episode 5 stumbled and made me feel uncomfortable with the scene of implication of gay attraction. No offence. I'd rather see Sci-fi discovery that is related to the science discoveries but not on this. Know that I even have gay people I love in my family but please, don't try to push things too much on this TV series. I will still watch this and give another more chance.

Also, I respect all the hard work of people behind the scene who worked hard on prosthetics used on Klingons but the actors became boring on their facial expression it's hard to see the natural expression of Klingons, its all the same when angry and when pleased, I was hoping with the new technology they would be better on this but, I am looking forward for them to improve a better Klingon look that could able to see their facial expressions. Their mouth could hardly open, its kinda too much evolvement. If anyone is not happy with my comment, I am sorry but this is my personal opinion and its up to others to do your own review or opinion. I am saying all this in case the writer of this TV show is reading my comment and hoping they would consider my opinion for the improvement of the show.

Oh and the last, I love the character of Michael, she got this strong personality that I really like about her... I look forward to see more of her capabilities and her strong side as well. Thanks",18 October 2017
"An amalgam of dark Star Wars, SJW, BLM, PC, Gender Neutral attempt at luriing the millenian audience. This is definitely not Star Trek.

"Season 3 is such a disappointment! I just couldn't watch anymore, first time that I actually hate a season of star trek!",27 November 2020
"Trying to reason with an unreasonable with the complete disregard to another opinion, perhaps best describe this fancy, and lackluster of a show. This new Star Trek is filled with such blatant disregard for any history and achievements to its progenitors, it instead uses and abuses whatever lore that made Star Trek a cultural icon to its own selfish benefits.

Instead of building and adding something new to its decades long legacy I instead watch it tear down history, episode after episode.

Despite my misgivings I was quite optimistic in the beginning, even protected the new show against naysayers by saying, ""new era deserves new vision"". I was perhaps both right and wrong in my assumptions, perhaps this new Star Trek is a reflection of our new era, an era that lacks any true vision, only a shortsighted mass produced copy paste of the original, like so many rebooted series quickly forgotten.

Being an avid fan I perhaps wishfully wanted it to be true, a true Star Trek experience that is, this is an experience I now wish to be forgotten.

And after such a long hiatus of not quite forgotten wonderful Star Trek series still lingering on fond memory lane of childish wonder and late night daze, that perhaps this will also fill my head with even more memorable quotes and pondering, and so I got lost in my own nostalgi.

Instead of worthwhile memories I got explosions, lots and lots of explosions blinding colorful dazzling light shows, to distract my cognitive reasoning; a myriad of shallow caricatures and contrived plot-point and dare I say it even ridiculous science fiction - science which is an achievement in itself in Star Trek with all its techno babble.

And so after a few episodes that frankly left me feeling confused, and shortly thereafter angry, angry because I realized despite its alluring packaging and nostalgi high it couldn't quite measure up to any earlier Star Trek standards, heck it can't really measure up to any decent cinematic standards, unless if you're perhaps Michael Bay?!

Like modern fast food this new modern show instead left me more empty than when I first started, and no matter how many episodes I watched I am still hungry for something more.

So ladies and gents that is why I give it a 1 in review because it deserves nothing that it hasn't not earned by taking on the name of our beloved Star Trek without giving anything substantial back.",3 August 2021

"In past Star Trek series, each episode was a complete short story with a type of moral ending, particularly in the original series with Kirk. This series is more like a long movie told over many episodes. Each episode continues from the previous episode to tell the full story.

So far I've only watched 4 episodes so perhaps the moral of the story will present itself at the end. One can only hope.

I also find that the time-line is a little messed up. I'm not sure, but I've read that it's to have been 10 years prior to the Enterprise with Kirk, however, the number of aliens in this series and technology would lead one to think it was much further in the future.

I also am bothered by the fact that aliens talk in alien tongues so we have to read subtitles. I hate subtitles. They're very distracting from the story line",12 October 2017
"It's exasperating to see the future having humans who are still so melodramatic and weak. If melodrama and emotional blackmail transcends the kind of brilliance needed to build the star trek world, I shudder to think if this kinda future would ever be real. Michel Burnham is constantly in a stae of unmanageable distress so conveniently scripted for emotional tugs of the heart of the people of this century. The importance on technology is heavily sidelines by melodrmatic marathons of the characters. I miss you Kirk.",29 March 2019

"On the plus side, this show has great production values, The special effects are tip top, the sets are great, and all of the costumes are of movie quality. The cast is also generally pretty strong except...

The show's main character is an actress with high school level acting skills. She's very camera conscious and always sounds like she's reading dialogue rather than actually speaking. Fortunately, her supporting cast does some damage control: particularly Issacs as Captain Lorca and Michelle Yeoh as the Emperor. I found myself wishing the show was about them, but I knew it was not to be..

But what really grinds the nerves on Discovery is how ""woke"" it is. You know you're in for a good blast of social justice indoctrination when the female lead has the name Michael, which I found distracting every time it was spoken, The whole sensibility of the show caters to the woke mindset, which may attract younger viewers, but certainly is off-putting to many older viewers and Star Trek fans. The final episode is so preachy, repeating the despicable ""that's now who we are"" which is just as intolerable here as it is in real life.

Oddly enough, when Michelle Yeoh returns later in the season, I found myself asking why the franchise doesn't make a Star Trek show about a really unscrupulous crew -- it was certainly far more interesting here.",11 February 2020

Then, like many others, did the creators/writers of this show watch any of the other ST series? Why not fit in better with existing canon? If this was supposed to be 10 years prior to TOS, why is the technology more advanced? And if you wanted an earth child raised by Vulcans, there was an entire planet of Vulcans.

"After watching Star Trek Discovery, season 1, I am not sold at all. Initially I held off not wanting to give in to the CBS demand to pay the streaming price. Ultimately, I did watch it but have not been satisfied. Keep in mind that this is a prequel to Star Trek Original Series. Here are my reasons for dissatisfaction. I list them by my personal priority (although the first two are a first place tie for me).

It is a series. This is the first Star Trek that continuously follows as a series of shows. None are stand alone. It follows primarily through the eyes of one crew member, Michael Burnham. That is also a vast departure. All other crew members are merely props for her space journal, which appears to be a tragedy. Technologies and warfare have significant continuity issues when compared to the Original Series, TNG and other shows. The Klingons in this show are very different from any other revelation of Klingons, and cannot possibly fit with the successive Star Trek shows. I really do not like the strange First Officer at all. The character is not a benefit, and adds nothing. Lack of interesting crew members. But as stated above, they are not necessary. I am not sure where I stand, but some people will feel a bit of politics being forced at them.",29 December 2020
"Preface: I came into discovery on its pilot date with moderate hopes. I was finally getting to see the Star Trek of my generation. You can imagine I was a little taken aback when I was met with this. I tried so, so, so hard to like it. I really tried and I eventually settled on my current stance. This is not Star Trek. This stance is the only way I can somewhat justify and comprehend what I saw.

There are plenty of YouTube videos pointing out the wrongs of Discovery. It looks like counter culture gone rogue. Everything is designed from the top down to be the opposite of what came before. The solution to every encounter is shoot-y shoot-y boom-boom. It's frankly embarrassing. Maybe this is an attempt at reeling in new blood! The focus is on expensive CGI and lens flare. When they do try to focus on greater moral dilemmas they trip over their shoelaces, this can be through glaring plot-holes or by just ridiculous stories and additions. I'll give an example of this. Spock an icon in the Star Trek lore. Now he's a space ninja apparently... in a show that is supposed to transcend our fallibility to find the best in humanity.

The only thing Star Trek in Discovery is the first two words. The rest is a parasite inhabiting the corpse of a once beloved host. Puppet-ing its limbs around in ways that make us think it has some sort of sentience some sort of motive. No, it's just fulfilling it's simplistic routine (live, die, repeat) franchise, merchandise, repeat.

If you want to know what Star Trek is... Star Trek is what's left when you subtract the money from a Hollywood production, the money lending benefactors and all therein. What's left? A cast that brings hope to millions, voices that have meaning, words that need to be spoken so the next generation don't repeat the sins of their fathers and mothers. That is Star Trek.

Once again. 'I would not have a problem with this show' if it didn't call itself 'Star Trek'.",5 December 2020
"I've been hoping for this show to get better for 4 years now... It is and stays the burnham show. While other star trek series have serious character development, fun and exiting episodes involving every main cast member this one is mainly about burnham, and I don't like that character at all, she is whining all the time, crying, whispering every line... there are crew members on the bridge that are there for 4 seasons and you still don't know any of them. Every season they try something new to fix what they did before but every time it gets worse as they go. At least Now there in the future and can't mess up the canon anymore... This show is by far the worst scifi series out there. And its ashame it Carries the name Star Trek. I'm glad it got canceled after 5 seasons.

Where is a amazing action? Brilliant dialogue? Mysteries? Brilliant way out of difficult situations?

And the ending...I switched off when they ""start making a Sup!"" What a joke...

"Do the people working on this even like Star Trek? I'm not talking about dipping in and out of episodes here and there, or the terrible reboots, anyone can do that, but it seems that has been the only qualifier to get a job producing it, which is a dreadful shame. There's no passion for a utopian future, no wonder, no depth. It doesn't explore anything, either in space or in the mind. It's all 2 dimensional glossy throw-away TV, and clearly not for anyone who has even a passing interest in anything Star Trek stands for.

This so-called Star Trek has clearly been made for an entirely different audience, which is a tragedy as it has always been one of the few shows for people with an actual interest in science, psychology and futurism.

All of that has gone now, and I'm quite insulted that CBS think so low of a long established fanbase that they could just throw branding on whatever this mess is and it be remotely acceptable. The only conclusion that seems realistic is that this isn't supposed to be for Star Trek fans.

Recently they are systematically destroying dozens of fan youtube channels which have been worked on for over a decade in many cases. Never in my wildest dreams did I think corporate greed would get this bad,

There isn't really much else to say, other than my trust in CBS and Paramount has been shattered beyond redemption. R.I.P. Star Trek ☹",27 September 2018

The scripts are terrible; a bit of movement forward then some pastey dialogue meant to use up some screen time. This is amateurish writing. And, yes, the lopsided amount of time given to Michael whomever is trying on the intellect. She does not possess the charisma required to carry the series.The plot catapults like a tennis ball, moving from one immense problem in one universe to another in an alternate universe. A word to Star Trek producers, cut the alternate universe out already. We've seen it in several other series in one form or another by now and it has become tedious. Focus on a cohesive plot, with characters that exhibit character. There are several from the past that could be cited of which you must be aware. BTW, the Klingons have turned into monsters. This is a result of the advances in technology come with the most recent incarnation of ST. They are eye catching but, unfortunately, at the expense of the acting and plot itself. This could be done in cartoon form with this dialogue. Maybe there's nothing left to say except ""where are we"" and ""what's going on."" Star Trek Next Generation and Deep Space Nine are the best, followed by the others and lastly, this incredibly amateurish performance.

"... it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."" Caution: reciprocal correspondent does not apply. I haven't watched much Star Trek in my life, but I'm not one to deny older Star Treks' merits.

In the first season the show treads the well-charted territory of prewar tension, which I was pretty satisfied with. However Discovery makes FTL travel idiotic. (Ignore that it was always unrealistic.) Then in season 2 Michael does the scientifically impossible. I can ignore that. What I can't ignore is that, lacking any common sense, the crew fails to use it to their advantage. And let's not forget about a frustrating Achilles'-knee-trope.

All in all, another sci-fi that lacks the ""sci"" part. Everything is driven by the action plot, with a few more or less interesting sub-plots. (Pseudo)-science is there only to support the needs of the main plot on an anything-goes basis. Nothing new here. At least they've used drones once or twice. In its defense, since it happens before other Star Treks, humans are expected to be more irrational. (Though I'm sure this wasn't planned.) Still Saru is my favorite character.",27 October 2020
Suru shows some nuts this episode but apart from that is more of the usual bad acting. They never focus on the Actors (apart from Micky Spock) for more than a short period to try to hide this. Every episode gets progressivly worse.,5 December 2020

"I feel horrible giving 2 stars, but honestly, the second season is soooooo bad.

Plot sux, I don't buy it at all. Just seen s02e05, and there has not been one believable scene this season. To top it of,they actually downgraded the effects and the rest is trash too.

I freakin <3 season one, was rdy every episode. The seamless thread from start to finish was amazing, the buildup was op 2. It was full of surprises and plot-twist. I gave the season one 8 stars, and 2 stars I have given the show now seams fair taking season two in consideration. Season two is just so undescribable bad, it breaks my eyes.

I alrdy regret the future hrs I'm gonna spend watching the rest of this useless season.

And I'm so confused. Some of me suspects they made this season so bad on purpose, how else could they ruined everything from season one so completely?But why would they do that? Why make bad tv? Just seams cruel.

"I'm a sci-fi fan and not beholden to Star Trek or what has gone before. With that said I quite liked the first season, with it's twists, and enjoyed the forgettable second quite a lot less, but the third season cannot even maintain interest for 30 minutes. It's just very dull, the characters are mostly either uninteresting, unlikeable, or both, and generally just not as good as previous incarnations such as Star Trek: Enterprise with Scott Bakula. Even the recent Picard series was more interesting and engaging. It helps that Picard can act, and there are characters we already cared about. There is so much other sci-fi that is way better and doesn't get as good a run... so I feel like this seroes trades on it's brand and borrrowed time.",5 December 2020

Season 3 and 4 are a writing crime against what Star Trek should be. I honestly think Gene Rodenberry would be horrified by this drivel.

"A poorly executed show centred around the unbelievable, unlikable character of Michael Burnham. The adage 'when the centre becomes periphery, the periphery becomes central' applies here. The central pillars of startrek and sci fi are moved to the periphery to make way for the god like character of Burnham. Burnham greedily hogs every scene, every plot line, makes each decision, solves each mystery and defeats every enemy with dreary predictably. STD's dialogue is poorly written and never feels genuine. Pseudo emotional monologues alternate between wooden exchanges where characters finish each other's sentences. Conversations are scripted in a strange way, describing what is happening for the benefit of the viewing audience rather than depicting genuine interactions. Plots are absurd; based around fantasy and magic instead of science fiction. The writing is a politically over-corrected mess, where male characters are given diminished standing and respect. Continuity has been abandoned; plot holes and contradictions litter each poorly written episode. There are glimpses of genuine startrek and elements of a good show but these only serve to remind 'what could have been'. Thankfully The Orville is filling the void left by STD, but come on CBS listen to the feedback!! Give Pike his own show",13 April 2019
I am not a historical Star Trek fan so this is coming from a sci-fi fan in general. The show was watchable and entertaining for the first several episodes but then just got worse and worse in the plot twists. I physically rolled my eyes on several occasions and stopped episodes right in the middle. I've watched it to the end so they accomplished their goals of keeping me but... I'd say have a small bar for plot and acting and it's watchable in winter darkness :),6 December 2018

"It's 2017 and Star Trek returns to the ""small"" screen. It's true that when Messrs. Kirk, Spock and McCoy jumped onboard the wagon train to the stars in 1966, most screens were small. Today, not so much, which brings me to the highlight of the newest Trek incarnation; ST:Discovery – it looks gorgeous on today's HDTV screens.

With a history (or is that a future?) spanning centuries, where do we find ourselves for the latest incarnation? Ten years before Kirk, Spock and the Enterprise, the USS Discovery discovers new worlds and lifeforms as one Starfleet officer learns to understand all things alien.

In the interests of full disclosure, I have been and always shall be a committed fan of Star Trek. I will watch it in all of its incarnations from the original series right up to Jar Jar Abrams' reboots. There is not a single episode or film I've not seen.many times. For this review of ST:Discovery I have seen the first two episodes of Season One: The Vulcan Hello and Battle at the Binary Stars.

Let's talk about all the good stuff. Firstly, it's Trek and its on the TV. Secondly we have an amazing cast including Michelle Yeoh, Jason Isaacs, Sonequa Martin-Green and Doug Jones. In terms of casting, we have one of the finest collection of actors one could hope to assemble. Thirdly is the look. The production values are extremely high and every dollar is up on the screen. It's a pity they did not spend more dollars on the wooden dialogue. Oops, did I say that out loud?

All of this brings me to the long list of things that, as a fan, bugged me. I fully understand that if you are new to Trek and Discovery is your first outing, then not much of what I say next will make sense. Why say it then? – I hear you cry. Well, because ST:Discovery sits in a linear timeline of previous Trek incarnations. We are told that this series is set ten years before Kirk and Spock and yet the USS Shenzhou has technology that they did not have. We are told by the captain of the Shenzhou that it is an ""older ship"". When Starfleet arrives to save the day, not one starship was a Constitution class ship, which we know were in existence. According to Trek canon, Capt Robert April was commanding the USS Enterprise at the same time as the events in these first two episodes. Am I nit-picking?

The Klingons, let's talk about the Klingons. I have tried to get over the new look but I can't. It makes no sense whatsoever. Again, ten years from the events in Discovery, Kirk will meet Klingons and they look nothing like the Discovery Klingons. One hundred years from Discovery, Klingons will be serving aboard the USS Enterprise-D and they look nothing like the Discovery Klingons. What gives? How can a race of people evolve so quickly and so differently. I can forgive Kirk's Klingons as the TV budgets of the 1960s did not permit the prosthetics we have come to expect. Discovery's Klingons not only looked wrong, they behaved wrong too. How come, given how far Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine explored Klingon history and culture, have we never heard of coffin-ships before?

And what's this? Spock has a half-sister we never knew about? The half-brother Sybok was bad enough in Star Trek V. Just how many waifs and strays did Sarek take in? And was it even necessary to have the first officer a ward of Sarek? It did nothing to move the story along other than provide an anchor into Trek lore.

I'm sorry, I have to go back to the technology and the starships. Kirk never had holographic communications with Admirals. He never had a Ready Room off the bridge. He never had a 180 degree panoramic viewscreen. His phaser rifles looked archaic compared to what we saw on the USS Shenzhou. The ship's computer, well what can I say? It seems more intelligent than Kirk's and able to perform more functions. The first-officer's ethical/logical discussion with the computer was a nice wink to Kirk's ability to outwit computers though.

Trek has always been about the characters. The most successful incarnations have focused more on the characters than the stories. For the first two episodes of Discovery the focus was on the tech. Character development was patchy. The Klingons were better fleshed-out than the Starfleet crew. The dialogue was clunky and the wooden performances from Starfleet's finest will hopefully improve as the actors settle into their characters. In terms of story, what was missing for me was allegory. Trek's best episodes have been allegorical. The first two episodes of Discovery were more Star Wars than Star Trek.

Will I watch more episodes? Yes I will. Will it sit comfortably into Trek canon? Probably not.

Based on the first two episodes, it's a disappointing 2 out of 5.",25 September 2017
"Is it just me, or do the Klingons look almost exactly like the aliens from the 1984 flick ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension""? LOL The show has some eye candy for sure and looks expensive. It has grit and action and the acting isn't terrible... It doesn't stink entirely... Just mostly.

That having been said, it's dull, dark (literally dark... frickin' turn the lights on so I can see something), too preachy, too whiny and moody, and does NOT feel at all like Star Trek. It's just not any fun. There's not really a single character that I like or am intrigued by (except for the captain, a little bit) and neither the ship nor the universe they live in looks like anyplace I'd want to explore... I've watched each episode so far, and keep hoping it will get better, but all I'm left with is meh. Don't get me wrong, I like elements of it, but it's just missing so much. So far, it's pretty forgettable and I am so disappointed to have to conclude that about a Star Trek series. Maybe, hopefully, it will improve. Right now, I'm pretty much out of it.

Oh, and speaking of exploring... what the heck is the title ""Discovery"" supposed to mean? There's no discovering in this Star Trek. I know it's the name of the ship, so what... This show is the opposite of Star Trek. It's like they are trying to dismantle everything great about the franchise.

I'm not a total purist. I like new stuff and I can get along with changes (even reboots), if they're good... These aren't. I would much rather have seen a series set post Voyager. Sick of all these stupid prequels and trying to make everything so hyper politically correct and shove this garbage down our throats. I doubt the show will make it for long. It will likely be canceled in a couple of years (and that's being optimistic) unless they make some major changes.

Has anyone noticed that the theme song is pretty dull, but also the video with it does not make sense. The drawings show elements from the original series technology; yet everything in this show surpasses that technology. It all feels so disconnected. The men in the show are whiny wimps. Everyone is always arguing with each other and fighting. The Klingons and their noticeably rubber masks and feather halloween costumes always babbling and I have to read stupid subtitles for half the episode. What the heck is this junk? Sorry, but Buckaroo Bonzai was more fun to watch and the alien masks were better. ;) hehe",5 November 2017

"It steals everything that is great in Star Trek, dumbs it down, contorts it in to a Star Wars fan movie and then throws really terrible writing at actors who really deserve better than this.

CBS and Netflix have taken a massive dump on the HUGE core Star Trek fanbase to try and bring in fans of Marvel and DC productions. The end result is really nothing to do with star trek, so stop calling it star trek.

Here's how to describe STD to a potential viewer:

Take Star Wars, contort it in to a TV serial show, put it behind a subscription paywall, take out all the iconic Star Wars stuff, and replace it with cliche Star Trek stuff.

Put Star Trek delta badges on every door, cupboard, piece of equipment the eye can see (even though it is actually just the Enterprise's badge at this point in history and nothing to do with any other Star Ship whatsoever).

Change ""the force"" for Vulcans with magical long range communication powers.

Change hyperdrive for mushroom spore drive.

Dumb down everything to a really low level so the net can be cast as far enough to capture as many stupid fish as possible.

Steal the sound effects from multiple other Star Trek franchises and put all of them in a prequel which supposedly happens hundreds of years before they even existed, just for ""Easter eggs"" when it's actually ""insulting intellect"" of it's core audience.

I am so angry CBS has tried to go down the JaJa Abrams road that I'm boycotting them. I have also ended my Netflix subscription.

The writing alone is incoherent crap. They step on their own canon each and every step. At times it's ok but then they go back to this sad story that the writers trapped themselves in and things go south, way south. Very hard to watch and try to guess what might happen next because, anything that makes sense quickly gets tossed out in favor of some magic crystal or other.

It's almost like they didn't know what to do anymore so they send the discovery into the future so they couldn't do more damage to the star trek canon. I say watch PICARD!

"I have watched an entire series of Star Trek Voyager and majority of DS9 and TNG, some Enterprise, all the movies, hence I can claim I am quality to know what Star Trek WAS/IS. And I love Babylon 5 (B5)!

Star Trek Discovery (STD) so far to its Fourth episode presented to audience a show that borrowed heavily on the base setup of Star Trek universe, with visuals that is Closer to the 'Jar Jar' Abrams' reimagining/reboot Star Trek movies. The FX visual production value is up there with ten million dollar plus SciFi movies two decades ago. It managed to make the show look more militarised and feels 'real' than the three major seven season long series.

Yet, the story presented so far, is closer to any high budget scifi show that IS not Star Trek like. It is not a series that reset the status every episode, but a war themed and arced serial. One closer example is the legendary Babylon 5! Yet, Babylon 5 has rich characters and well developed conflicts of an entire war from start to finish each episode onward via the eyes of multiple key characters, audience so far was not presented such development or hint of such depth on STD.

No where there are the hints and sub plots elements of Star Treks' philosophical trademarks so far, audience is presented a crisis military show with Star Trek technical elements as basis of the world building. Therefore it can be any made up sci fi universe and the show still works! Therefore judge the show as a sci fi spin off that base on Star Trek universe technologies, it is not bad, it is pretty watchable given one can swallow the occasional plot holes the size of our moon.

I believe if STD can find an audience, a reboot Babylon 5 TV series with similar style visual updates would Trump STD to the nearest blackhole.

In the mean time, for those that wish to make Star Trek great again has to watch Orville and hope there won't be fart jokes ever...

If this show is not called Star Trek but something like Galactic Quest of whatever, i will give it 6 out of 10 so far. but i have to deduct that one point for mis using elements of Star Trek.",11 October 2017
Discovery of what? Feelings? Just too much. Like watching Greys Anathomy. And the low voice frequency of lead actor when she starts explaining something is just bad acting.

The writers should study and comprehend Rodenberries philosophy and attitude towards ST and watch and love previous editions, before even thinking abot writing new episodes. They obviously didn't done that, because no one could after write this awfull stuff after...

"Lifelong Trekkie here, not that that matters. Most of the bad reviews seem triggered by some hidden ""liberal agenda"" that I must be blind to. That being said, the first two seasons of this show have been VERY ""meh.""

TOS aside, Star Trek shows usually take two or three seasons to find their footing. Have people forgotten about the execrable first season and utterly forgettable (Measure of a Man aside) second season of TNG?

The writing on Discovery, unfortunately, is first season of TNG bad. There are some good ideas and fun moments, but for the most part it's just boring, with lots of ""twists"" that you can see coming from an AU away. They're trying to cram it full of shocking moments and reveals because they think that's why people liked Game of Thrones (hint: people liked Game of Thrones because of the characters). The serialization reminds me of Enterprise's Xindi arc, which is not a good thing. DS9 did serialization right.

The action is just boring. It reminds me of the Star Wars prequels in that it's a bunch of flash with no stakes.

The characters are ok. Tilly, Pike and Saru are charismatic and fun. I THOUGHT Burnham might have to deal with being torn between two worlds, exploring her identity, emotions, relationships, etc. (like Spock, Data, Odo, Seven, and the Doctor), but she just seems to always be on the verge of tears, and there is no indication she was raised on Vulcan aside from the occasional flashback or exposition. The rest of the characters are completely interchangeable and seemingly exist only to have concerned/relieved reaction shots before and after the next crisis.

I desperately hope this series finds its feet in season three, however I think CBS is trying to appeal to a demographic that doesn't exist, and the writing staff is not up to par. This is writing I would expect from Xena, or Transformers, or Batman & Robin ... Oh no.",23 May 2020

"Now, let me just say, that the pilot for STG had some problems with it it. BUT, it had a real story, arc, etc., and some really strong acting. This has neither. Aside from Jason Isaacs, most of the acting is very weak.

It relies heavily on CGI. The Klingons were terrible.

I want to like it. Really. But, if nothing else is done, the writing has got to be improved. The exposition is terrible. In the opening number 1 is telling the captain information, then we find out she has been with her for 7 years. There was no way she had to mention it, aside from being exposition.

This looks laid out more like a movie, and most importantly, Sonequa Martin-Green does not have the chops.

Klingons consider the body a shell. The past was ignored.

Last, but not least, why couldn't Isaacs keeps his accent?

"Every episode of the first season was packed with excitement. The character development proceeded at a good pace and without a lot of extraneous drama. (i.e. Didn't suffer from NetFlix syndrome). I thought fictional ""science"" always seemed plausible enough. I never found myself thinking ""this is too fantastic"" as to be a distraction. The story arc was tightly integrated into each episode. All this meant lot's of exciting and entertaining moments with very little ""fat"" in any of the episodes. BUT THEN CAME season two which has left me cold and empty. It's a totally feeling this year, more like one of those poorly executed formula series. Season Two the flow of the story arc is routinely disrupted by side stories. Obviously I'd like to get to know characters but this often came off as forced or unnatural. In addition, the science has really gone off the deep end in S02. There are multiple occasions where I was not able to suspend disbelief. The quality of the acting has definitely suffered and I get the feeling that the actors are just having a hard time with poorly constructed dialog and awkward situations.

I've read some articles that make it sound like there has been a lot of turmoil in the first two years of production. This might explain why season one and two are so much different from each other?

I really hoped all the people involved can pull together and rescue this series for a 3rd season. No such luck, The writing feels even more sappy this time around. The only character I still find enjoyable is played by Michelle Yeoh. I really feel sorry for Sonequa Martin-Green. Supposedly raised by Vulcan's.... please.

"When you take Star Trek, a show ostensibly about affable geniuses working together for the betterment of everyone, and then try to turn it dark using played out modern TV tropes you end up with something messy and unlikable.

I am not sure if it is Kurtzman's writing, the awful first draft dialogue which is delivered poorly, the boring tropes that have been done to death but are being called revolutionary for Trek(?!), or the plain unlikable characters who we have to be told are geniuses rather than them showing it, but something about this show rubbed me the wrong way.

I think it could be Michael Burnham, who is one of the most unlikable protagonists in anything I have ever watched, never mind Star Trek. How she came to be a first officer on board any ship is a mystery to me but here we have to follow her from dour depressing scene to dour depressing scene looking into her dead eyes that convey nothing to the audience at all. And her decision making is hilarious.

Never before have I been so aware of a TV show being written backwards. It really shows. Sure, some of the effects are good, (but very very uneven) however the camera work is schizo to the point where it ruined the already rather poor scenes of what this show considers dialogue. I'd talk about character building and relationships but there isn't any. Burnham has supposedly served on the Shenzou for 7 years but the impression I got is the characters have known each other since the scene started.

And the Klingons. Oh god the Klingons. They have covered them so vehemently in prosthetics that they can no longer emote or speak properly. It is the very epitome of over designed and ruins what would otherwise be potentially interesting adversaries.

I could go on and on. I really could. I adore Star Trek, it has always been one of my favourite things. It isn't that this show isn't traditional Star Trek that bothers me. It just isn't very good. I can see what they were going for, but to do that you need an interesting main character and strong writing. The writing is laughable.

There is no heart here. No hope here. No levity here. No warmth here. It is dark to a fault and it feels like a bunch of CBS execs pushing a product rather than an organically created show.

And I am so sick of seeing people saying old Trek wouldn't work in 2017 or whatever excuses they try and use. Sure, perhaps you are right, but flipping to the other extreme is one of the strangest decisions I have ever seen. It hasn't worked.

"As a long time Star Trek fan I swear I have tried to like the show, although seasons 1-2 were ""ok"" for me and I have scored it high just to give my beloved universe a chance, in season 3 I just cant. I cant defend it anymore and I cant justify watching it. What is this? Why is it trying to be so ""woke""? It supposed to be in the future were society has gone passed such issues, just stop.

All episodes have people crying, hugging, breakign down, Burnham continiously whispering and crew having sentimental toasts in the end of almost evert episode. Last episode I watched they even removed Georgiou, which kinda brought a balance and authority to the show.

Where is the ""Discovery"" part of the show? What do they Discover? Feelings??? Star Trek should be an exciting adventure, not a tenenovela drama. The ratings got up during season 2 where characters (that tankfully are having their own show) where brought into the show to ballance the bad season 1, in season 3 it went into full emotional breakdown mode.

Anyway, looking forward to Strange New Worlds, i really hope with the amazing acting of Mount/Peck the show will deliver true Star Trek material.

When timelines changed or alternate realities were introduced, the could be justified within the world of Star Trek. Admittedly, STD does offer some resemblance to Star Trek...there's a slightly familiar ship and it uses the name Klingon. That's about it. Otherwise, it does not reconcile with the world of Star Trek so many have strived to maintain, even the newer reboot movies (which are pure genius).",12 December 2018
"Season 1 is admittedly a deviation from typical Star Trek plots; and, while it has a weak plot and passing/childish screen play, it is at least watchable and enjoyable.

After the off-season season news that CBS got that they needed to improve their ratings, I was hopeful the show's writing and directing would improve.

Season 2 episode 1 is a flop. I can think of several comically bad independent films that have better screen writing on shoestring budgets that are more palatable than this episode. Don't get me won't, the visuals and imagery are beautiful! It's is pretty to watch, and that is the only reason this review isn't a 1 star.",20 January 2019
"I can no longer watch this season. Endless close ups of sad faces and crying. An unbelievable storyline that could be explained in five minutes but is drawn out to 40 odd something minutes. The mindless disregard for protocol that always works in Michael's favour. And the never ending ""We've got a spore drive"" to fix the FTL problem.",28 November 2020
"I've stuck with this awful show just to see how bad it gets. It's hit rock bottom and started to dig. Nothing makes sense, CBS and the writers are terrible and can't write SF. Oh season 3 is coming and boy it's going to suck",14 April 2019
"This series completely lacks any sense of Star Trek. Historically the Prime Directive challenging human moral values ran as a constant undercurrent supporting any story line. This series has completely removed any sense of adventure , discovery or moral code , all the things that would make it Star Trek. Star Trek has always been for me, one of the most forward thinking, openly inclusive shows on tv , first interracial kiss , female captain etc , black captain. Discovery has such forced dumbed down stereotypes. And my final thought , these are military trained space adventurers. They wouldn't cry all the time.",19 December 2020
"Bring back a series in the line of TNG, DS9, VOY. Everything since Voyager is just plain terrible.",28 May 2019
"If you were hoping for a continuation of the Star Trek that most people know and love (and I am not talking about the JJ Abrams movie franchise reboot junk), you will be bitterly disappointed. This has big budget movie visuals, and that's it.

The writing is bad, character development is amateurish, story and action pacing lame, and the lines are throw away. Absolutely the product of suits calling the shots and turning this show into a disaster. We only get to know two people in the opener, and the rest are extras on the set. Michelle Yeoh is only thing that keeps the rating from being a 1.

All I can say is wow. The rumors were true that this production was a complete mess. Watch for yourself, but don't say I didn't warn you. Instead, check out some of the fan productions like Star Trek Continues on youtube.",25 September 2017
"What a nice show! Ooops, this review is about Star Trek: Discovery, sorry... Well, 445 in 1600 reviewers give it one star, and i agree with them. Please, stop trying to make money and let Star Trek rest in peace.",30 August 2018
"Came here just to write this. Your writers have clearly never seen a single Start Trek episode. Even if this was a normal sci fi series it would still be utter garbage. But calling this Star Trek is an insult! I've watched every Star Trek series, even put up with Star Trek Picard which was equally bad but at least it had Picard in it. But Discovery's season 3 has reached a new low and I simply cannot continue watching it. Star Trek is not about overly emotional characters crying about things that aren't sad and sharing their irrelevant feelings at every opportunity in lengthy monologues. That's not Star Trek. That's not sci fi. That's just dull. Shame on you for robbing my time watching this!",21 November 2020
"While it's nice to see a technologically up-to-date Star Trek series, it's probably the worst of all of them - at least by judging from the pilot episodes.

Newly designed Klingons without hair, a captain with swollen tongue syndrome, a cast forced by political correctness.

The intro is quite underwhelming, the dialogues boring and actors overacting. Feels like the episodes are going in slow motion.

I literally watched every Star Trek series and movie so far multiple times, but this one is disappointing. 4/10 because i am a flesh and blood fan and that's the best i can give.",25 September 2017
First things first I hate to use of the first officer being called number one. Number one is purely a Captain Picard thing never used by any other Star Trek Captain or Commander. Next I was far more impressed with the Star Trek series Enterprise then I am with this particular offshoot. I know it needs more time to develop but as it stands right now I don't believe it will last.,25 September 2017
"This is what happens when leftist propaganda gets in a way of making good film. This is so sad, because I thought that it is impossible to make horrible star trek series. Until I watched discovery.

The series is full of ""product placement"". Where the product is leftists/LGBT/feminists ideology. While watching you know exactly when cringe moment starts.

The authors (I home they will be banned from making movies) could achieve the same thing if they knew how to do it in more startreky way - more subtle.",21 July 2019
"Any true Star Trek fan will have been angry and disgusted at what they have witnessed. Everything was shockingly bad.

How they can spend 6 million an episode and get utter dross. What a wasted opportunity. :(

1/10",25 September 2017
"Not worth even penny Star trek always had diversity, but this is far away from that.

They made TV show for minority of star trek fans, and failed hard

Technically it's okay. Effects are fine. But more advanced tech in prequel is not really good thing.",25 September 2017
"Hopefully with the addition of Captain Pike and Spock, this train wreck can be salvaged. I gave up on the series very soon into season one as a result of weak lead characters and story line. Bringing on Pike was much needed. The Commander Burnham character is still disjointed and full of directionless emotion but I think the Pike character will bring that into better focus.

Time will tell but S02E01 was watchable enough that I will watch the second episode. I have no idea how the series has garnered a 7.4 rating given that I've yet to read a positive review.

Season one seemed a little too ""affirmative action"" to me. They simply tried too hard to be diverse and it didn't work very well. Previous Star Trek series were very diverse but you hardly noticed it because the acting was superior.",20 January 2019
"OK. There's two ways of looking at this. Is it good Sci-fi and is it a good member of the Star Trek franchise. Answers: no &, er, no. This doesn't really work either way. As a Star Trek spin off there's an awful lot wrong with it. Having not read the previews I ended up being very confused in the first series as to where it actually fits in. And then, when I figured it out, it just didn't seem to make sense. If you look at the supposed chronology of Star Trek, this program seems to be technologically more advanced than the original ST. And Spock seems to be a totally different character than any other version of Spock from movie or TV. At first I thought that this was a piece of completely different Sci-fi that someone had not been able to market without dressing up as a Star Trek sideline. But, then, by S2 I decided that it must be written by desperate Star Trek fans who are thirsty for a new fix of Star Trek and have got so desperate that they'll put up with this. Then, just to please the marginal viewer groups, they've filled the inclusivity holes. Really filled them. With a galatic wheelbarrow! To the point that it actually grates on you as it is so un-subtle. Now I'm not being un-PC here.....it's just too obvious and spoils the show (or rather spoils it even more!). Some people are saying that it works on it's own as a separate piece of Sci-fi and to watch it on that basis. That, to an extent, is true, if you've never watched or read any other Sci-fi! There are some good scenes or segments. But the whole thing just does not work and some parts are largely, well, ridiculous. The mushroom based star drive is absolutely ludicrous! I know that Sci-fi pushes the bounds of imagination. But this is just too much. The story lines are just too far fetched, sometimes they drag, the style jumps around. It makes the whole thing very bizarre. I watched all of S1 & S2 and the vast bulk of S3. But, it was just too bad by then to watch anymore. Really regret the time wasted watching it. 3 stars -1 for the FX, 1 because I feel bad for the low score and 1 for the sheer bravado of the show runners and creative team in getting this signed off!",17 October 2019
"I have read many of the reviews and most are spot on, so really no need for me to state the obvious as it is the Michael Burnham Show! What I cannot get my head around is this, if this is 10 years YES 10 YEARS before Kirk/Spock/Bones et al why do we have sophisticated Star ships that are better than anything in Voyager TNG and DS9 !!!!!!!!! . Excuse me but did everything suddenly go backwards in technology ?. Ok we had the explanation of the difference in Enterprise and Star Trek Original series ,which was a fun episode in that series also how the Klingons became how they looked in Star Trek Original series but this is beyond now if we are a different Universe why not say so from the start ? As for the poor Klingons they must now have a real identity crisis ! I think someone on this show was a fan of A E van Vogt and his story The Voyage of the Space Beagle, where 1 man on the ship, because of his cross knowledge of all sciences etc is the one who save them and as stated in the book as the most dangerous man in the universe. If so why not do that story and not add it to the Star Trek series which this clearly is not. If you stand back blank out Star Fleet and the Klingons you might have a passable series with some better actors added for good measure.",25 January 2020
"So I read a lot of reviews and a majority of them were 1 star, which I think is not really fair I think this show deserves 0 stars. The acting was like watching a soap opera from the 90s and I have seen better character development in adult films, who wrote this crap? I can not believe they showed this to a test audience and it scored high enough to be made into a show. They also insulated themselves perfectly from criticism, as I have seen the producers already calling critics sexist.",4 October 2017
"I grew up with The Next Generation which became the show that all sci- fi would be forever compared to. I watched it slowly lose it's originality and charm with some of the spin offs that followed and then it disappeared for a while, eventually re-emerging as a transformers wanna be with JJ at the helm. Bla... Then I hear about a new CBS show, optimistic I was, but skeptical I remained. The other night I watched the first episode of Discovery on live TV Live TV, hadn't done that in a while. Well, I'm exaggerating a bit... I watched the first 20 minutes. I shut it down in disgust and did something else. What an awful attempt at sci-fi this was. This show does not deserve the title Star Trek and Gene Rodenberry must be spinning in rage somewhere in the Q collective! RIP Gene. This show had no character development. Terrible special effects. Zero story. Flying superhero women in space! The lamest rescue in sci-fi history. A help sign in the sand? Wow, how long did that take to write.

It's been 20 years since Star Trek The Next Generation rule the airways and its obvious now that feat will not be duplicated with the name Star Trek in the title. Star Trek is dead to me officially. I will not be paying for CBS all access. In fact the only way I would ever continue this show would be if a terrorist forced me to endure it, but I'm sorry to my fellow countrymen, but I would give up the secrets before their terrible new theme song ended.

Watch the Orville instead, that show is a brilliant piece of work and CBS should hand the rights of the name Star Trek to fox and let Macfarlane have it. He's doing it justice right now.",26 September 2017
"I accepted season one and excused a lot in exchange for klingon battles, although blatantly stolen. season two was so bad im scared to watch the third, this coming from someone who will watch anything star trek. Its rare to see a canon so utterly nuked with so much to reference, the ignorance crosses into the realm of absolute stupidity.",23 November 2020
"This is at most a mediocre sci-fi series that has the happy potential of being canceled after two or three seasons. It is in the same class with shows like Stargate Universe that didn't stay true to their roots. STD also seems to be the victim of some clumsy liberal agenda, set to create a strong female character but fails unsurprisingly.

Of course, people who are not Star Trek fans will love this show. You can already see this in some clearly shallow reviews. But true Star Trek fans have already disowned it with good reason – it has nothing to do with Star Trek. No exploration, no sound characters, no narrative depth, and no soul at all.

The whole series is based on one female character with a guy's name. This is her story per se, everything is told from her perspective. There are no other characters. Yes, there is the annoying roommate, the tall coward alien, and the nut job captain, but they are mere props, filling in the plot gaps.

As expected, the IMDb rating is high thanks to the paid reviewers. There is also the half-wit reviewers who can't tell a good show from a bad one. You could put a refrigerator in front of them, and they would watch it as a new sci-fi series. You could open up and show the vegetable compartment, and they would say it was a great episode.

But I have to hand it to STD: it is better than the Kardashians, though not as entertaining as a regular Trump speech.

P.S. I don't know why, but Klingons sound like chickens. They make this weird vok-uk-vok-uk sound. Maybe it is their turtle-faced make-up.",16 October 2017
"Scientifically Wrong: Binary stars have one set of orbiting planets, not separate sets; no one suffocates in 15 seconds; corpses do not decay in space.

Wrong in terms of canon: Affliction and Divergence, 2 Enterprise episodes, explained the evolution of the Klingon's appearance. These crazy-faced Klingons from Discovery (we saw representatives of 8 of 24 houses) break canon. The insignia used was for Enterprise crew only at this time, a ship in service under Captain Pike as of the premiere of Discovery. Across hundreds of episodes only 3 made an error in this regard. That does not justify adopting the error as your logo and plastering it everywhere. And no, a memo doesn't change canon.

Klingons did not have cloaking technology at this point in time.

I have to choose. Discovery and prior Trek cannot both be canon as they conflict. Either nothing in Star Trek prior to Discovery is canon, OR Discovery is not canon. I choose the latter.

Wrong in terms of technology and other features: Holograms? Then why in 10 years will they disappear? A ready-room, really? Shiny tech all over (very Kelvin-like) with huge screens? So in 10 years the Federation will apparently suffer some huge technological setback?!

DO NOT COUNTER that no one today would accept the original look. They would. Here's proof. At least 3 amateur productions of Star Trek shows based on a strict TOS look have thrived over the past decade and longer. Rogue One adhered faithfully to the look of the original Star Wars so well that you can run the two movies together and it is seamless. And Rogue One was a resounding success. The fact is, the Discovery show runners did not care to act as stewards of the Star Trek universe, but were instead intent on imposing their ego all over it. The result is failure.

Wrong in terms of drama: Slllllooooowwwwwwwwwwww! Paint dries faster.

Wrong in terms of character: Burnham would never really do what she did in this story. It just doesn't fit. And it is the central act of the entire show.

Wong in terms of tone: Not hopeful. Not about reaching out. It's all about circling the wagons and fighting. That's not Star Trek.",29 September 2017
"Star Trek always was based on deep and profund questions that explored philosofy, science, humanity and dealt with every subject with a level of precision and subtlety that made every debate a new sort of poetry.

From the teatrical interpretations of the Classic Series to the realistic human behaviour from the Voyager crew Star Trek always managed to insert complex discussions into character development that felt real, that felt like a daily thing, and respected a kind of structure and hierarchy that was a glimpse of a future well-working society, better than ours at some level.

Star Trek Discovery takes all of that and ignores with a rebel atitude that looks of that a imature teenager that doesn't quite know how it's suposed to be. This series turns everything Star Trek upholds and give a childish interpretation of things. Makes terrible writing decisions, oscillating between frivolous actiong and talkative moments in hopes of tying everything down.

It is the worst sort of garbage.

Here's hoping for a big change in the near future, or the complete cancellation of the show.",8 February 2019
I'm 12 episodes into the 1st season and I'm not sure I can go on. I watched all of Star Trek Strange New Worlds which as of now is only the first 2 seasons. So I was looking for something else to watch and started to watch Discovery. There is a lot going on here and honestly I'm having a hard time keeping up or more like I don't want to keep up. I have stopped a lot of Discovery episodes part way through which I something I rarely do. It's really the most un-Star Trek thing I've ever watched. Not sure what they're doing here or why. You know sometimes one has to take the good with the bad and I'm guessing that maybe this is extra thick story setup to get us through the rest of whatever the series is but I haven't turned the corner yet. I doubt I'll come back as there is too many others things to watch. I wanted to like it but they just pushed me away.,1 October 2023
"After season 1 there is less and less action and sense.. and more and more hugs, tears and snivel.. Such a waste of great initial idea.

For example - season 3 - you can find interesting episode 1.. and that's it - after that 1 tiny, usually with no logic behind it action (especially non-sense looks episode with Vulcans) - and complete waste of time

It seems that there was only season 2 scripted and it was decided to spread that into 3 additional seasons adding 90% time of stupid dialogs

Promising series turned into a complete disaster.. I only applause actors who have the power making silly smiling and crying faces from episode to episode - can't imagine how they tolerate it",29 November 2020

If you are looking for the trek vibe, don't watch this. Mayb the first few episode's but its no where near tng, voyager, dsn or enterprise. Tng is by far the best imo.",19 March 2021
"Odd that the show is rated 7+ here on IMDb, when I calculated the average user scores around 4 (+/- 1). It's even worse if you throw out the 1 and 10 star reviews. It's more like 3.

It's garbage. Top to bottom. It's a real mess and I don't think that it could recover. The only thing going for it is the name, Star Trek and the CGI is pretty nicely done. Everything else... garbage.

Most of the high and almost all of the 10 star reviews are from people that have some kind of problem with people not liking the show. As if me not liking the show is a reflection on who I am personally. That's insane. How about review the show and leave your agendas out of it.

The show is bad, but the inner Trekkie in me hopes that they can turn it around. But I'm not holding my breath.",6 October 2017
"What on earth is this show now? It isn't star trek, not as we know it.

Been a star trek fan for decades and this show plummeted from season 3 onwards.

For me, it is more a soap opera now, I am all for inclusion, but this is woke overload. The show forgets its audience, at least the long time fans of star trek in general. Does this appeal to a younger audience? Have they missed the mark there too? I don't know.

I thoroughly enjoyed the first 2 seasons, Michelle Yeoh was brilliant and a big loss to the show on her departure.

Picard has also become disappointing, but not as much as this show. At least we have through backs to Next Gen and Voyager in there.

Apparently this show has been renewed for a 5th season, so I guess it is doing well......... Or maybe they are flogging a dead horse.",27 September 2017
"I liked the first season for numerous reasons, one is that the LGTB movement is strong in ""the future"". Sci-fi is always enjoyable and Star Trek leads the way in that. But the main character Michael Burnham played by Sonequa Martin-Green really does not have to whisper every single line coming out of her mouth. Really over dramatic and you just have to include subtitles. yeezzz. Season 2 is a real disapointment, to much over dramatics and little story. This will probably me the last season and I agree with that.",25 December 2020

"I'm a big fan of all previous Star Trek shows, but oh dear oh dear what have they done with this latest incarnation. It's just mindbogglingly boring with no memorable characters or plots.

This gender-neutral, identity-political nonsense is now destroying entire series and films. I don't understand these viewers who think that's a good thing. This emotionality is extremely annoying, in every scene we are allowed to experience a mental meltdown and this constant crying... this pathetic crying just disgusts me. This Kevin Spacey victim in particular is a disaster. Rather enjoy the old series from the 90s than do this nonsense.

I had to struggle through the first season, the second was better but only because of Captain Pike and the third season got worse and worse from episode to episode. I won't watch the fourth season anymore, judging by the reviews it's also the worst.",16 March 2023
"Discovery started...in a mediocre, to say the least. But the series is getting better with each episode. Which indicates that the writer(s) clearly meant this to be a long series, not one with a great first season followed by bad/mediocre ones (like in the case of Falling Skies for example). From this point of view, it may be similar to Deep Space Nine (at least I'm hoping it is). Moreover, it's starting to make connections between events which have only been mentioned in other series/movies.

It's clearly different than the other Star Trek series, but personally, I find the change refreshing. The only negative point is that it's plagued by political correctness. The main character is black, we have Asian commanders, gay officers and as many women in charge as possible. It's completely ridiculous.

All-in-all, Star Trek Discovery is the perfect example of why a person should wait until the first 10-14 episodes have been released before writing a review. One can hardly write a proper review after just a few episodes...

Just to be clear, I'm not some SCI-FI rookie. I've seen every possible Star Trek episode from every series (and I've seen most episodes more than once or twice). I've also seen every single ST movie.",6 February 2018

Apparently it is now written for a different generation, and sorry to say the storyline is lost on me. I has completely broken with current Star Trek Canon and I miss the optimism that emanated from the other versions (OS, TNG DS9, Voyager).

"I never write reviews but the amount of hate reviews is just absurd. All proclaiming to be fans when they are nothing but haters.

The argument is always the same:""it's not like Star Trek"". Oh really? Well TNG wasn't like the original Star Trek. And deep space 9 wasn't like the next generation. And the movie were different at every turn and enterprise was different. I am a huge fan and I have equally loved and hated different iterations.

But one thing is clear - if anything defines Star Trek is to change and that is the single reason it's still around. It always has and hopefully always will address and show the problems of the times it was made. You might disagree with the change but boy do I prefer this than lose the entire franchise.

And now for this iteration.

It's the best ever. Why? Is it the best captain or the best space ship or the best story? Maybe not but it transmits that what is for me core to it's franchise and what i love about it- boldly go where no one has gone before. Every episode I go lol - wow so cool I would love to be there. That's true for the context for the characters and yes the set design and cgi.

I've watched the new version Discovery up to Season 2 episode 10 and had to finally comment on the experience.

Being former military, it grates on me when orders are ignored without much consequence and decorum and bearing are lackluster. That being said, the arrival of Captain Pike has improved the show for me but my biggest critique is still the Michael character and how it seems every episode revolves around her and how she'll save the day. Her past, her present, what she feels, how smart she is, her emotional attachments and on and on ad nauseam. If the writers would focus more on the storyline and how they all work together as a team to accomplish a goal, the show would be much more enjoyable.",18 December 2019

This Is the most idiotic script in Star Trek franchise!Jesus!,20 April 2019
"It's very conflicting because while I like the show, it should not be included in the Star Trek franchise. I am a die hard fan of the original and TNG. I will call this show Discovery and NOT Star Trek Discovery, because I don't feel it belongs to the franchise. TNG and Voyager were very politically correct in many ways and even with an underlying political commentary. Star Trek was always forward thinking, bringing out the best of humanity. So I don't mind the PC aspects. I could definitely do without the profanity and overt sexuality, because I would have liked to watch this show with my kids. Discovery strays from the family aspect of the originals. Star Trek has always been diverse and has been inclusive of all cultures, gender and ethnicities. Voyager in particular has a very diverse and interesting cast with women and many ethnicities in high ranking leadership positions. The problem with this casting is they chose actors who are very flat in terms of Star Trek standards. Many of the same actors are recycled from other high profile shows and seem to play the same types of characters. Star Trek has typically been known for unique, original and dynamic characters you fall in love with. Discovery makes it difficult to fall in love with any of the characters. They are good actors, but not Star Trek dynamic. I would have liked to have seen new actors in these roles. Then the Klingons? I like that they spoke Klingon, but then they completely diverged from the original look. I am fairly certain if Star Wars fans saw a revamped Chewbacca-they too would be up-in-arms. So while the show took aspects of Star Trek, it didn't fully commit to the prescription...which leaves any Trekkie very confused and moderately offended. While there are aspects of Discovery that I like, it won't be a staple show that I watch for years to come. It is a good space show and nothing more. I would have liked if they had mixed the new with the tried and true Star Trek formula. So...for now...it's fine. It's entertaining, but it's not a ""Star Trek"" I will subscribe for.",2 February 2020
"Why? Why did someone has to create this serie? He could have spent his time with something more productive for humanity, like knitting. Hollywood cinematics overdose. Fast all scenes are as stupid as they can get. Conversations are usually super fake, the scenes are so cinematic it literally hurts.

That one is also sci-fi, but the characters are not complete morons.",18 May 2019
"I have been looking forward to this series ever since it was announced. I've been a trek fan as long as I can remember, and even Enterprise was awesome.

"I do like StarTrek but I am not sure what is this supposed to be about. Season One was still OKish but in Season Two those big speeches, overemotional overdramatic acting where half of the time you wish you can skip then having to listen how someone feels another one understands and someone feels sorry or overreacts this just went over the tophere. I did want to see the end of the story so I did watch it all but wish it was more about some decent science exploring universe and all the interesting stuff as it used to be and why I used to like it and not so much about some constant issues of Burnham crying all the time her boyfriend acting like he needs some meds as so emotional the gay couple just has to be these days its fashion not exactly what I need to see but whatever but again so much emotions and drama I just forward it. Creators of Star Trek Discovery should maybe consider focusing on something else but not Star Trek. Maybe a serie about a psychiatric unit you know people constantly on the edge overreacting not too emotionally balanced they just cant handle it crying need some meds maybe a holiday good sleep but I wouldnt let people like that flying Discovery. Maybe Philippa was good, the rest needs to grow up",29 June 2019
"I and husband were staunch Star Trek fans for 40+ years but ST Discovery has changed that for us. I am 67 years of age and am so very very disappointed that the noble Star Trek became ordinary American TV trash. The entrance of the ""f—k word was the final straw for us. The TV industry gears this toward young people and children....so why is the f word in there??? These TV show producers are obviously leading youth into cursing and dark places. The Klingons and their voices are so ugly then we have to read translations???? Why???? Why are they so evil??? Why??? Gene Roddenbury would never allow such trash. The characters bring no comfort to the viewers unlike the noble cast of the beautifully rendered Star Trek Next Generation. It is foul TV and we are so very very disappointed. Ugliness...pure ugliness. We are done with it.",23 October 2017
"I remember watching the first TOS episodes as a young boy. I loved them, just because I loved every movie or TV series with star ships in it. Later when I was a teen TNG came out and it was the first time I got aware of that Star Trek series are not just random episodes of sci-fi fun but an own universe with own physics rules, different alien races and complex interstellar political issues. With DS9 they deepened the understanding of that universe and all it's rules and made it step by step even more complex and interesting.

And oh boy there was a lot to learn about that universe. There was the religion like believe of the Klingons in their greatest warrior Kahless, The Vulcan society which was completely based on logic, There were ship classes for every species with detailed specifications of their technology and a complete history of the human race to the stars starting with the invention of the warp drive by Zefram Cochrane. Each alien race had their unique design for their whole technology, architecture and cloth which fitted even when the different series were hundreds of years apart.

Sure there were several plot holes which they had to fix and explain in ENT. What they did pretty well. At that point a very delicate web was knitted to fit all the bits and pieces together. A complex universe which was fully explained to play with for future series authors.

So we all looked forward to a great new show in that universe. Would it be about a more modern ship two centuries after the Enterprise D? Maybe a short series about the Star Fleet academy? Could have even been one completely out of the view of Vulcans or Klingons or about the Eugenic Wars. The Star Trek universe is a giant sandbox full of things to play with for an author.

So what did we get then with STD? SJW nonsense, unfitting ship designs, unfitting race looks, unfitting star trek officer behavior, unfitting technology in that time-line. Unfitting control panels, unfitting uniforms - basically if there would not be the word Klingons"" mentioned now and then you would not even be aware that this story plays somehow in the Star Trek universe.

STD trashed 60 years of story development and then puked a big pile of SJW idiocy on it, stirred it up with some standard factory CGI and feed it to the public.

Everyone involved in the making of Star Treck Discovery should be deeply ashamed for failing completely as authors, set designers, producers and directors. There was basically no way to mess it up more then they did.",26 September 2017
"The story, visuals and the universe world hold up to standard if every single moment wasn't ruined by actors constantly over-acting. Everybody is constantly in awe, gripped by emotions or living out an inner struggle. This is, by far, the biggest and worst breach with star Trek tradition. I hate having stuffed these actor's emotions 7 throat all the time. No real human beings, let alone astronauts or members of a star force, behaves like these people do. Their behaviour is more outlandish than the sci fi tech in the star trek universe.",16 October 2020
I'm left confused and disappointed. There have been sparks brilliance but it's let down by an all over the place storyline And lots of whispering and crying.

I'm not against trends, but I'm against lack of talent, meaning and logic. A forced, trumped-up characters. Absurd dialogues. Mediocre game of the main actors. Only negative characters in this season have charm and charisma. Positive heroes like the characters of the Communist agitation of the era of the 60 years of the last century.",18 February 2018

Do you like social politics in your sci-fi series. Then watch this.

Why do they employ writers that have either never seen Star Trek before or just don't have any idea about what it made it good?!,17 October 2020
"Firstly, Is it so hard to come up with another adversary ?....I mean change the names of the Klingons to the Magellans and the changes in ships, weapons and warriors become less irritating. Take it one step further and take ""Star Trek"" out of the title...Then would the show stand on it's on merits ?, I guess we'll never know.

Secondly, I don't like the imbalance of the characters, just too many cold logical parts for my taste. It's all guilt and angst. Captain Lorca comes off as so intense as to be border psychotic, Michael Burnham comes off as cold and logical....sort of Vulcan.

Thirdly, whilst I'm basically OK with the Michael character.... would ""Star Fleet"" or ""The Federation"" really abandon the child of a pair of Federation Scientists in the care of an Alien just because his wife is from Earth. Not a chance.",18 November 2017
"One season after another, it reminds more and more a soap opera. Not star trek. Childish and exaggerated, cartoon-like characters with no chemistry in the group. A series can be engaging and interesting without futile drama, overreacting and desperate faces 80% of the time.",14 November 2020
Calling this 'Star Trek' is definitely a reach. They should have diverted some of their cgi budget into hiring writers.,23 February 2018
"Something that made star trek special to me was the characters. Micheal is full of contradictions, and bursting with emotions - not expected given her supposed background which would have been entertaining to see unravel/develop but instead it was dropped on the floor like a wet rag. She jumps to conclusions haphazardly about what other peoples motivations are and well overall the foundation her character rests upon is mere sand constantly shifting depending on her circumstances.

Other characters are just extremely linear. No deviations in character and no development. You find out a few episodes later that a few officers are gay but that is all I've seen so far.

With more to say about the complete disregard to typical Star Trek lore. Klingons and Vulcans typically have major roles in the series but have been completely butchered. I'm not even nit-picking here there are major changes. Vulcans have been made to appear more aggressive as a species with some new abilities. Klingons are now no longer the true aggressors in the story, yes they strike first but only because they feel initially threatened by the federation and don't want to lose their culture.

The show just isn't good.",25 January 2019
"But Michael Burnham and Philippa Georgiou kinda ruined a lot with their bad/over acting! and michael continues to ruin a lot with her dramatic reactions? Why is she consistently crying over every little thing that happens to her? Shouldent she been toughened by the fact she was raised Vulcan? And all that stuff that she has experienced this far in the series!?

I can't help but wonder if she is told to act like this? cause i dont remember her being that bad in TWD even though i didnt like that character aswell, I even had the silly idea that she is on medicin/drugs? that can sometimes make ppl extra sensitive. I don't hope any of the 2 actors read this criticism by the way, because they shouldn't care what an random idiot like me has to say about them on the internet. But I really need to vent my frustration here since I think all the other characters are great! Especially Saru! and the visuals are stunning! just need less crying and more exploring/discovering ;)",13 January 2021

"Well, not only is the flagship of the Federation oddly run by fresh from the academy kids (something the previous series managed to avoid), but they're also filled to the top with their special little dramas.

The first season was pretty watchable, but this second season is next to impossible to watch, especially for a Star Trek diehard fan.

Special effects were brought to the next level, but the message of political correctness overpowers the entire show, to the extent that the message and plot are entirely lost.

This could very well be the XXIV century adaptation of Grey's Anatomy meets Glee, and would certainly applaud it if it was named after those shows.",19 November 2020

Maybe, what I could point out that it's just extremely bad, independent of it being ""Star Trek"". If it was a completely different show it would have been one of the worst things to watch on Netflix.

It's boring, pathetic, unimaginative, cheaply produced, badly acted. There is nothing good about it except for the title of ""Star Trek"".

"I seriously disliked the first series. None of it made any sense in the Star Trek world and the virtue signalling was annoying. I especially disliked the 'reimagining' of the Klingons. I hung on, hoping woylujd get better, and it did - a little bit, but not enough to draw me back in. A year or so later I read some good reviews of the 2nd series, so gave it a try. This was much better because the narrative worked to overcome all the silly contradictions of the first series. Including. Captain Pike - the best character in the series, and linking it to the original Star Trek that Discovery was supposed to precede - made it work quite well. Having Spock in the series was also key. He was a good character. There was still too much time wasted on people emoting, but generally worth watching and gave Discovery a logical fit into the Star Trek narrative. The third series was...okay. A lot of it didn't add up, but at least the ship fits in more at its new future location than it did in the pre original series time. But the emoting got sickening at times. How many times would a real commander or crewman spend vital minutes telling someone how much they loved, respected etc them when disaster was seconds away? I'd say...never. Kirk, Picard and Janeway never did. Oh, and tge politically correct virtue signalling was out of control. So, I'd give the three series 3 stars, 7 stars and 5 stars.",18 April 2021
"Homosexual and family hating agenda.. SJW trash. Its gross and disturbing to watch a show filled with the homosexual propaganda.

Do these idiots really think we want to watch men kissing men? Is this Star Trek or gay-man porn? There are 2 types of people who will like this show, the SJW's and homosexuals, everyone else will hate it. The ratings are dropping into a trashcan, it wont last to season 3. BTW, The Orville is much more like Gene's vision, Star Trek Discovery has missed the mark and an embarrassment to humanity because all the actors and actresses are awful and act like spoiled little brats.

But my personal bug bear with STD is the whole spore drive concept. It just doesn't make any sense that star fleet had access to this technology some 170 years prior to Voyager but chose not to use it to bring them home.

"The start of the series looks like a patchwork of all things that I've already seen in sci-fi. There one thing that troubled me most: This is the first Star Trek series in 12 years. Why did the creators simply ignore all the advancements real science has done over that time? Given the march of state-of the art prosthetic, it's fair to assume that brain to machine interfaces are about 30 years off — if the engineers take lots of days off. None of that in the series. Head up displays? Chevrolets and BMWs ALREADY have that. AI? Writers never heard of it. Kirk's comm in the sixties was a taste of future mobile phones, a prophecy that came true. Picard's Enterprise computers in TNG were a taste of predictive voice activation — see Siri of Alexa. Where is the spirit now? All I see is fear to break the established canon. I can't say the episodes aren't worth watching. But I'm disappointed.",1 October 2017

"This is female cast overload. Maybe I should say that this is a Star Trek for women. The helm sits 2 women, the captain, admiral and 1st officer (the main character) are all women. The cadet is a woman and everyone who really has a good idea that gets followed through comes from a woman. If you watch all 15 episodes you would think that all the chaos that is going on is caused by women in this timeline of Star Trek. Heck, Michael (main character) is not only fighting with herself all thru this, but fighting with other women. Seem they just can't get a long. These women just have all big egos and can't stand it when a man is in their way. Thank God for Aliens to step up and become an acting captain. These women kill off not only the captain (a man) but they kill the male captains of the Klingons too. These women don't seem to want to share but take control of everything no matter if the end result is either destruction or war. But hey, in the end, it takes a Klingon woman to threaten to destroy the home world and let the main character bask in glory of saving the day. I still like Janeway, she was way smarter of a captain and had many men she should rely on to help her make the best choices. I watched it all the way through season one just to see how it ended and I would have to say, all the previous captains, even Janeway, could have done it in one episode. Now they meet up with the Enterprise with Captain Pike which will start season 2. I hope they don't make captain Pike a woman...that will totally ruin what we know as Star Trek. I hope in the 2nd season they tone down all the hate, anger and power control these women have and realize they can coexist with men.",23 February 2018
Story in the future took the show from somewhat watchable to cringe mode. Lots of feelings and story going nowhere. I gave up after s3 ep 6.,20 November 2020
"It's hard to create movie level drama and action in an hour but they did it for the most part in the first season.

When I first saw the cast, I was thinking this would be junk. But when I saw the first 5 episodes and was introduced to Lorca, I was like damn! This is your dark sinister Trek! He reprises his mad scientist role from the OA. Don't expect the previous philosophical, jolly holodeck stories or musical scores. I do not want that!

The action and drama in season 1 wasn't lacking and carried through each episode. Maybe 6 - 8 was a little slow. Season 2 up to episode 10 so far is really slow. I lowered my rating from 8 to 7 but I still look to watch each new episode.

The cast is good. I really like Pike but it's hard for anyone, even Kirk to top Lorca's large role. We need him back in a different Trek if not this. I like Burnham but started to get real annoyed with her showcasing emotional, caring, crying eyes skills. I started to expect it coming with each episode. Make it convincing she grew up a Vulcan! There's nothing Vulcan about her - 100% a cry baby. Stamets and Culber are great. It takes a bit to acclimate to their relationship and I'm not a fan of political statements but it's slightly toned down for those who aren't fully acclimated to it. Culber especially was under-utilized in his role but it seems they're doing something about it in the second season.

The one thing that was obvious and annoyed me was the writing wanted to make a statement on disobedience. Burnham or whoever were always questioning and disputing their captains. I felt it diluted the role of the captain and made them look dumb and simply a person to bounce thoughts off. They made Lorca and Pike look bad. Do it a different way if they have to.

Overall a great show. I was all wrong about it but my rating seems to be getting lower with each episode in season 2. I also had to edit my review basically to say it's amazing how many purist losers have nothing in their life but to troll every new positive review after mine and immediately give a thumbs down and thumbs up every negative reviews.",9 March 2019

"It looks like Star Wars in disguise as Star Trek.

The Klingons are all wrong, not only because of the way they look, but also their ships, clothes, culture, behaving, and so on. What ever these aliens are, they are not Klingons.

In the Star Trek universe, it's all about teamwork, respect and exploration, and this series doesn't have any of that. There is almost no story, the crew seem to work against each other, and it's all about the action and special effects.

Even though they have copied names and sounds, it's not enough to call it Star Trek. I see it as an insult to Gene Roddenberry, and to Trekkies all over the world.",26 September 2017
"Unlike most reviewers, I liked the different, somewhat chaotic approach of the first episodes of ST-Discovery. After all, nobody was waiting for a modernized rerun of the outdated The Next Generation (I watched all ST series multiple times).

But the last episodes went from weak to worse, and the final episode really destroyed everything. Typical 'American ending', totally unbelievable 'feel good', already weak acting Klingons became outright morons, and then an awful, almost unwatchable 'heil the sacred Federation' speech... just outright terrible! As if the script writers intentional chose the worst possible ending they could come up with.

There will be a second season, but ST-Discovery seems beyond repair. Maybe the new androgynic pre-school generations will like it after all, who knows. Times have changed, but not for the better.",22 July 2018

It's a pity to imagine that the Star Trek universe is over once and for all. The abramsverse is ok, but, again, it's not Star Trek. This Discovery thing was a hope, but, after all, it ended in disappointment.",1 February 2018
"I grew up watching TOS. When TNG went on the air I thought it would never hold it's own against TOS. I was very wrong! Next Gen had all the Trek flavor that made the original so appealing. Then came DS9, Voyager then the prequel Enterprise. Each had it's own personality but never strayed away from that original Star Trek flavor. Now we have been given a long awaited Discovery. It completely missed the mark. Discovery is completely void of what makes Star Trek so... Star Trek. And don't even get me started on the Klingons. There's no need for the Klingon language with subtitles that go by so fast you miss half the dialogue. Speaking of language, there's also no place for the F bomb. If I can't watch it with the family, I probably won't be watching. They really had a chance to get it right and blew it big time.",19 October 2017
"What a terrible mistake to consider the federation as evil! I could write it better, even without the help of specialists. They have included the gender ideology to manipulate the people, what a shame! Is Michael Burnham a female name? I don't think so.

The series is definitively awful. The director and the actors should be fired.",22 November 2017

As a viewer I did not care, because there was no emotional risk for me.",24 September 2017
"As a long-term Trek fan, this show is an interesting case.

I like a lot of things about this show. However, I'm very disappointed they made half the episodes TV-MA and most of the rest strong TV-14. This does not make it more entertaining for me, but the opposite. Star Trek has never had to include graphic stuff to be good - that's almost the whole point of the show.

What I've always liked about the Star Trek is the optimism and the absence of cynicism. ST: Discovery doesn't feel like past Star Trek. The look is darker, the story is darker, the characters are darker.

If you think Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Voyager were quintessential Star Trek, then this new ST: Discovery is anti-Star Trek. No one acts very Star Fleet - they are constantly disobeying orders. They are all flawed. Most of the characters are jerks, although that changes somewhat as the season goes on. The captain in this show would have been, in past TV series, the ""problem captain"" causing trouble that Captain Picard or Janeway had to deal with.

When I saw the first several episodes of the show I thought, ""This is actually what you would get if you found people to make a show who had only watched a couple of the recent Star Trek action movies, but didn't know anything about all the Star Trek TV series before that."" Then I found out that is basically what happened.

However, what Star Trek needs at this point is fresh approaches. This show provides that. I find myself enjoying the show a lot, even though I may decide to skip all the TV-MA episodes and just read summaries. The look of the show is spectacular, so can overlook that it doesn't look very Star Trek to me. The characters and situations are engaging. Sure, the Klingons are as tedious as they always have been - I'm hoping for less and less Klingon as the show goes forward. But at least they look like aliens, instead of amped up Rastafarians from earth.

So I have big hopes for this series, and now also all the other new Trek shows that CBS recently announced. It's an absolute annoyance that you can only get this through CBS suscription streaming. But if you make something good enough, people will do what it takes to get it.

Do I miss the old Star Trek, with its emphasis on exploration and a more evolved future? Yes, very much. Let's hope these new action Trek's aren't the only kind of Trek we get from now on.

But we're talking now about Discovery. It's entertaining and different, so I like it. But please no more TV-MA.

Update: I have just watched episode 1 of season 3 and I'm lowering my rating. In hindsight, season 1 was a train wreck. Season 2 was almost watchable. But it looks like season 3 is back to wrecking the train. What are they thinking with the Michael Burnham character? - does anyone act like this? It's a tragic missed opportunity to show a great strong, intelligent Black woman character. This show does not feel like Star Trek, and it's not interesting in its own right.",13 December 2018

The casting is hilarious, but the acting is even worse!

Taking clichéd crap like a logical Vulcan lead, with emotional issues, gee where have we seen this before!?

Klingons look like shite! What, did they evolve into what we have come to know them as?

Gene is rolling in his grave. Thanks China, take your censorship and propaganda and shove it.",26 September 2017
"So so so bad! I was speechless, but as I have to write at least 5 lines to meet IMDb criteria, here are my thoughts: Another example of ""progressive"" sheep think committee writing! This is not going to effect change, this is not moving forwards with the many problems in the world, this is just contrite bland tripe, with race and gender swapped cardboard cut outs for the sake of its own ""feel-good factor"". Shame on you Netflix, shame on you! This sort of poorly actioned, self important, agenda driven preaching of a certain real world political narratives I feel will turn people off to the genuine issues, rather than engage them, and is best kept out of beloved shows. If you have to spew this out in this manner I believe it is best kept to Youtube, along with the other poorly researched, overtly biased, unrepresentative cobblers people find it necessary to create.

Seriously, look at this show: Poor plot, lack of consistency with previous cannon, and out of touch with Star Trek universe race narrative. This follows into the terrible characters, that have no real depth or meaning. Nerd rage is high for this show, but many are afraid to say anything for fear of being labelled, or even worse targeted for personal attack! Don't take my word for it! Other reviewers have identified these and the many other faults, looking into them at much greater length than I have, so go check them out, as I am unable to post links as part of this review.",7 October 2017
"After paying for CBS All Access specifically for Star Trek Discovery I finally gave up after watching the 1st 6 episodes and beginning of the 7th. At least I enjoyed the full season of The Good Fight before canceling the subscription.

I would not watch this iteration of Star Trek even if it was on free OTA TV.

I understand it has been renewed, I cannot understand why. Hopefully next season will be better.",30 October 2017
"Seriously, What on earth am I watching? I have been a trek fan for over 25 years, I really enjoyed every series, even though they have all had their strengths and weaknesses, but what on earth is this?

Everything about this show is everything that is wrong with the millennial culture. What kind of arrogance takes the essence of trek, turns it upside down and has the balls to claim you are continuing a legacy? I don't even know where to start....

What are these Klingons? If you wanted a new cool looking alien, make a new one, don't turn a classic species into weirdos that can't talk properly because they have a mouth full of socks. Episode# 1 starts a gigantic war? Have any of the writers and directors even watched trek before? Wars in trek are born out of the mission of discovery, if you start one do some bloody discovery first!! The main character is a complete nuisance. When in the history of trek has the main icon not been a captain or a commander? How am I supposed to look up to this nuisance character? What is the deal with the attitudes of the crew? Every single one of them argue with authority...I feel like I am watching high school children on a school bus. I want to throw every one of them out of the air lock. What on earth is the deal with the captains standing desk? One of the producers had the audacity to claim it looks imposing? Has he ever read a book, been to court or read history? Those in authority SIT in judgement while their underlings stand before them. That is the way authority works. Add a standing desk in between and the captain looks like he is protecting himself. The imagery is communicating the opposite of what his role demands. A spore drive? Really???? Maybe if you writing a sequel to next Gen, but in the current time-line it is beyond absurd and makes no sense. Why do they insist on insulting the intelligence of the fans?? And then there is the unwarranted swearing in episode 5? When in trek do they ever use foul language, certainly not for childish laughs. Trek is supposed to represent the best of humanity and this show wreaks of unprofessionalism, undiscipline, silliness and immaturity. Trek is dead, the millennial culture simple does not have the character, nor the culture to comprehend and reproduce the the essence of trek. I will keep watching with a bleak hope.",16 October 2017
"This show is awful. Another reviewer talked about the need for everything to be politically correct and they are bang on. First, Let's make sure we have a black person as the star and give her a guy's name like Michael (um, What?). By the way she's 100 pounds soaking wet and can somehow kick the crap out of a Vulcan male twice her size. Second, We'll hire a gay guy to play the modern day ""data"" and make sure to have a gay scene with yet another gay discovery character. Third, Make sure you've got a British actor faking an American accent (Christian Bale as batman comes to mind) because for some reason you can't find one American to play the part. Then you find a dorky girl with makeup covering her horrible acne (which looks absolutely awful in HD) Every time I see her I think maybe that face wasn't made for television. I get it not everyone is a model but come on. I don't need to see a girl with four layers of cover-up on every show. It's just like every Star Wars movie that get's released now. One black person, one Chinese, one middle eastern, one Brit, a female lead warrior, and more politically correctness out the wazoo. I can't watch any of this crap any more.",30 October 2017
"Not going to include any spoilers or details, just my general feeling thus far.

Had high hopes for this show and it is so far an utter disappointment. It just doesn't feel like Star Trek at all. I am by no means a purist and enjoyed the newer JJ Verse Trek movies and I almost think it would be easier to head cannon this into that universe. But to think that this is 10 years prior to the Original (Kirk era) Series is just hard to mentally fit in.

The Klingons are just flat out horrible. All the pre-launch speculation that they were some sort of sleeper ship (like Khan) would have made for a much better tale - but they still looked like someone was just trying too hard to put their own spin on them (or the original concept spin back on them - which at this point should just remain in the past). It is just too radical a change.

As for the actors, I have seen some of them in other shows and know they are good - but the dialog and story just fails them here (though maybe it gets better in later episodes). Characters make decisions that just don't seem rational - especially as career Star Fleet officers.

Right now the Orville (aside from that horribly forced 1st episode) feels much more like Trek then Discovery does - it is a sad state of affairs when the guy who wrote Ted better understands Star Trek than the IP holders.",5 October 2017
"This reboot of Star Trek was written for the morons that can't tell the difference between high quality science fiction and this drivel. Cyril M. Kornbluth wrote a classic sci-fi story in 1951 about a society where the masses where idiots that consumed everything and understood nothing. This is crap was made for that audience that wants lots of blasters, CGI, but doesn't want to tax their brains thinking too hard as evidenced by the absurd unbelievable plot lines, incongruities and violations of nearly every facet of Trek lore. So sad.",3 February 2019
"Just ignore the irrelevant negative so-called reviews!

Discovery is the best Star Trek series to come along in years, far surpassing Enterprise in many ways.

If you hated the JJ Trek films (as I did) and are worried that this is essentially that in tv form, do not fear - it is nothing like that rubbish.

Give it a chance, and ignore the haters.",27 January 2019
"Im not sure what this is. This is not star trek. This is propaganda. New ideas, instead of being presented in a reasoned fashion, are just thrown out like creative ramblings. Maybe they used to have scientific consults, but got rid of them since science would reveal the insanity of their bias.

I recommend to fire up some of Kirk or Riker's original work instead of spending time here.",25 September 2017
"This show makes a mockery of everything that has come before it. This isn't Star Trek, this is a story stolen from a game and repurposed with the name Star Trek. The scrips are bad, the acting is bad, the sets are bad.. That's before we even get to what they've done to beloved characters we've all lived with for years.

NO NO NO! Cancel this show and erase it from Canon! I truly hope the Tardigrades lawsuit succeeds.",25 January 2019
"First things first: I'm a HUGE Star Trek The Next Generation fan. I consider TNG the best TV series EVER (emphasis on EVER) made. So it is inevitable that i compare every other TV series (especially a Star Trek series) to my gold standard. Of course A LOT have changed both in technology and in film making since the 80s. One cannot expect a modern TV series to be just like that. Differences are inevitable, even desired.

I've watched the first two episodes of Discovery and here is a small list of thoughts:

Pros:

+ Excellent production values

+ Very advanced and sleek technology

+ The new Klingons are spot-on. They are quite frightening but most importantly...

+ They don't speak English! Three things are ridiculous in all previous Star Trek series (actually in every Space-related series): 1. You can hear explosions in space 2. When spaceships meet they are perfectly aligned as if space is a 2D surface 3. All alien races, even those from the most distant parts of the universe, speak English! So Discovery got at least #3 right :)

But there's also one worrisome issue, a minus, one that has been mentioned in many reviews here on IMDb:

Cons:



I'm giving it an 8 for potential though it probably doesn't deserve it.",27 September 2017
"I can't believe this even calls itself Star Trek. Like other reviewers have point out, it's the Michael Burnham show.. and she just isn't at all an interesting lead. The show is beyond boring even with its fancy CGI action packed special effects! I couldn't finish season one, was told season teo was better.. here I am unable to bring myself to watch this garbage of a show through the end of season 2. Seriously, avoid this dog pile and the inflated critic reviews.",17 July 2019
"I was first to give it a 3 for the effort, but after a night sleep, it deserves a 1.

I have seen better Star Trek Fan club videos on Youtube (Star Trek Continues for example) with better stories, keeping the time-line and much better acting. I grew up with TOS in the sixties and they had less to work with and came up with great episodes.

I suggest that they can this series asap and go back to the drawing board with better writers, better costumes, better actors and better director.

What a disappointment!",27 September 2017
"When I was in kindergarten I was channel surfing when my mom wasn't watching and I ran into Star Trek Next Generation. This was in the late 80's. I had no idea what I was watching. I couldn't comprehend 1% of it but it pulled me in like a vacuum cleaner.

By the time I was 13 my mom was trying to get me into becoming a good Christian boy, but I felt that I was so beyond that. I'd learned so much about ethics and morality from TNG that joining a religion seemed like a step 5 steps backwards.

For me Star Trek was about the exploration of humanity's philosophy, literature, scientific theories, cultures, religions and all of the limits that we endeavor to overcome.

This new series... oh my god. I'm one of those people who find themselves in the middle of the alt left and the alt right hoping that someone in the middle can do or say something sensible to silence both sides so that we can move forward peacefully in a logical direction.

This show is so hard left. It feels like the bad guys are made out to be jihadists. Human women on this show can perform physical feats which less than 0.5% of human males could ever hope to achieve.

Modern feminism is really clogging up Hollywood. I really didn't mind Mystique and Jean being such important characters in X-men because they are incredible characters with amazing abilities which can accomplish a which few can do in many situations.

But the human women on Star Trek Discovery are not mutants. They aren't genetically enhanced, either. That's really illegal. That's what killed hundreds of millions of people in world war 3. They're just human females and they pull off some freaking AMAZING physical feats which can't be explained.

Not only did they attempt to appeal to modern feminists (I've got no issue with classical feminists) so that they didn't get shouted at by a bunch of cave-women but they seemed to go out of their way to make sure that every minority could appear on this show.

Heck, they've even got minorities which don't exist! I can't recognize the species of 1/2 of of the crew members on board and I spent literally thousands of hours watching Star Trek from 1989-2006.

There is one species which I can't recognize, but I should be able to because I know them VERY well by name. Anyone who watches Star Trek knows them by name. They're made out to be an intellectually inferior species on Discovery. They talk like cavemen or like people who were born with the IQ of a toaster oven. It looks like their culture, their appearance and their abilities have all been completely re-written.

Then there's technology.

Remember, this is before Kirk. This is 10 years before the Star Trek 2009 film but they've got technology on this tiny little ship which puts Kirk's ship to shame.

Despite having the intellect to belong to a federation with all of this flashy technology at your fingertips, the crew members banter back and forth like 16 year old's on a high school debate team. It's like they're telling the current young generation to argue, resist and fight anyone who doesn't share their view.

This is after Archer/ Star Trek enterprise, so I don't get it. Every single thing that is discussed on the bridge is debated heavily. The chain of command is ignored in many situations.

I'm trying to imagine what could be accomplished if present day NASA had this kind of work environment. I'm guessing that every manned shuttle would end up blowing up before reaching escape velocity.

I'm really sad.

I knew that there would be another Star Trek series the moment that Enterprise was over. I just had no idea that they'd just leave behind everything that made Star Trek great.",24 September 2017
"I watched everything Star Trek. I was truly sad when Enterprise with Cpt. Archer got canceled. I loved to watch different Species work together in an futuristic environment. Something you would turn on, watch it for an hour and be left with a good feeling. What humanity could achive in such a bright future.

Discovery has no heart, no warmth. No soul. Its this special effects, action at all cost, unnecessary plot twists, lifeless characters.... U could put any theme on it, it has nothing star trek characteristic. Put it all in star wars, it wouldn't make a difference.

I am disappointed to the bone.

This show is not worthy of having Star Trek in its name.",1 April 2019
"This series has great special effects, good stories, and good actors. Why the middling rating? Because at critical points in the stories, they always seems to take time out and talk about their feelings. The bad guys are on their way and will be here shortly to end the universe, people are dying all around us, but let us take some time to talk about our feelings about our parents (or lack thereof), our love lives, our philosophy of life, etc. It is just ridiculous.",12 October 2020
"The 2nd season was much better than the first. Frankly, I wrote it off after the first season and I couldn't bare watching it, thinking poor old Rodenberry must be spinning like a centrifuge in his grave. :))

The show is definitely trying to make up for the lack of imagination and great story telling (writing) with expensive surroundings, costumes and impressive CGI. When the production is overcompensating with the fluff you know it's going to be a bad show. It is. It's like a corporate TV show produced by Allergan as a small step-up from some god-awful Powerpoint presentation.

You can just see these overpaid-while-untalented corporate brainiacs come up with characters and storylines in a conference room. Atrocious.

The Klingon makeup is so terrible the poor actors can hardly speak lines in them. Hard to even make out what they say because their false teeth and copious amounts of make up makes it hard to articulate words clearly.

Most of the actors are good, though I hate the so-called ""comic relief"" actress Mary Wiseman playing Tilly. Just awful. Repulsive. Another incredibly annoying actor is Anthony Rapp playing the gay science dude. Horrendous. He's got two faces. One is the resting face and his other is the ""worry face."" Those two aside the rest of the cast is pretty good.",21 April 2019
"Discovery is a pretty good show. It starts slow and not that impressive but it really picks up after the first 2 episodes. I watched a lot of Star Trek, but I'm first and foremost a sci-fi fan. And this show is a quality sci-fi.

If you are a die-hard Star Trek fanstraight and you are insulted by the wrong color of some race pubic hair you should probably pass this.",24 October 2017
"I must watch star trek if its available. So they will take my money. But now i feel abused. Setting aside the propoganda, the terrible terrible writing rips open plot and continuity holes faster than they can close them. I can forgive the preachiness, star trek has always been preachy. I want my daughter to be interested in science so im fine with the cringy yum yum lines. I don't care to much for cannon and neither has star trek over the decades, so forget all that. But the writers don't seem to be able to follow their own rules and plotlines. I can't reccomend this show to my friends and family , it's too embarrassing.",23 April 2019
"Have to say it's like Someones heard of StarTrek but has never seen Star Trek and decides to make a Star Rek Series.

It lacks depth, seems over-fond of special effects and lens flare.

The Original, ST-NG, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise all understood that Star Trek was a homage to science and story, this is just a homage to its self and ego. It lacks any real depth.

Watch Pilot and first episode, and have to say cannot see ones-self wanting to watch any more.",7 October 2017
"As some dislike this 'prequel' series I actually like it. Allthough I have to agree on the fact this is perhaps somewhat sinister for the Trek universe it also suits current times as the older series from the franchise seem a bit outdated, to me atleast. I'd have to say a series like ""Orville"" did a better job paying homage to the original Star Trek universe, even while its supposed to be a tongue in cheek version. I love both new series though, each for its own strengths.",3 May 2019
"The Squire of Gothos ""It simply means that Trelane knows all of the Earth forms,but none of the substance."" Not one character is of interest. All are tasteless cardboard. All are miscast.

God bless those that believe Discovery is brilliant or even good. You have much akin to Dr. Richard Daystrom with his delusional belief the M-5 as ""a whole new approach"" to multitronics.

Discovery: where every man has gone before done poorly. Where is this generations 60s equivalent sci-fi masters Gene Roddenberry and Stanley Kubrick? Some of us ancients need change. Never can we go back to misogynist Kirk and we don't want to. But this derivative of a derivative serves no purpose. TV dramas have improved light years from 70s. Unfortunately sci-fi has not followed suit.",25 September 2017
"How can you take such a production budget, such imaginative concepts and such a rich history and miss the mark so badly? It truly seems this series is being made by a team of Star Trek haters. That's it right? You hated Star Trek and so have decided to put on the costumes and stomp on all the most important (and, you'll soon find out, most loved) qualities of the series.

This is like watching a remake of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" only the bad version of Bedford Falls becomes reality, and worse yet, George Bailey becomes Mr. Potter. Get a clue! No one wants to watch that.",28 February 2018
absolutely terrible. bad acting bad storyline this series will kill the star trek name. Paramount and cbs fix this. Main character michael is a poor character for this series to focus on. These are not klingons they act like pirates and not a race that fights for honor. Need to fix this tell the production team to watch an old star trek series episodes.,25 September 2017
"Unfortunately this series is as cookie cutter as hollywood can get. They spent so much time trying to be politically correct and please the masses they lost site of what Star Trek was about. There is nothing new in this show. The entire time it feels like it is trying to be its own show and come out of the closet and admit it is not star trek. If it had been it's own series and not just use species and vague references from star trek, it may have been entertaining. also another prequel/timeline? why would it be so hard to continue into the future of the star trek world? One of the great things with early star trek is the audience could be any age. I would not consider this series appropriate for younger audiences. When I was young I feel star trek was a positive influence. The show allowed me to think outside the box and explore imagination in a scientific way. Discovery tries so hard to just please the thoughtless masses.",9 November 2018
"I love Star Trek. I've seen every iteration multiple times. But this one...oh dear.

I so much want it to be good, and in many places it really is. If it would just tell a decent Si-fi story from start to finish, keeping the viewers with the story and action it would be fine .. possibly great.

But every ten mins it breaks off and goes off at a tangent with hushed chats about each others feelings and how they never were accepted or they feel guilty about some past issue.

It is all so forced. Its a totally unnatural way to make a program and guaranteed to lose all the flow and just cheese the viewers off.

It is almost as if it is written by two teams...one does the Si-fi story and the other does the personal stuff. And they are all filmed seperately and then cut together willy-nilly. Please just stop forcing 'issues' into every program and every other character, it is doing the exact opposite of what you want - it is actually turning people off.

I have found that the only way I can watch it is to watch the story parts and skip through the other forced nonsense.

This is not the same show that we grew up on and hold dear to our hearts. This is not the same star trek that has lessons, adventures, respect and a joy to watch. This is an abomination. Terrible acting from minute 1, no life lessons that you find in the older series, and no sense of adventure. Mutiny and insubordination on the 1st episode? are you kidding me? The characters talk to each other and treat each other like they are in high school. I think I'll just re-watch the original series, one episode of this garbage was enough for me. Don't waste your time folks.",14 January 2018
"IMO, STD has failed to deliver Trek in a satisfying way. Having learned of all the behind-the-scenes shenanigans, I'm not too surprised the wheels were off the cart.

The horrid history of Paramount and Viacom is a story in itself. CEO Sumner Redstone split the companies, and the fallout was the extraneous timelines (Kelvin and Prime) that resulted from the division of rights and licensing. JJ Abrams got off to a decent start with the first ST movie in the Kelvin timeline, but subsequent outings got worse as they went. Then along comes STD with the ""Prime"" timeline, which only served to make matters worse.

The show shouldn't have focused so much on the character Michael Burnham, because Sonequa Martin-Green just doesn't carry the show. And I thought I was going to really enjoy Michelle Yeoh as Philippa Georgiou, but I dunno, she just didn't excel either. I thought Lorca was the best character, with maybe Saru second. And don't get me started on the Klingons...

At any rate, I gave the first season a try, and felt it didn't deliver. I may give the second season a try, but I'm not stoked.",9 June 2019
"There is so much lore in the Star Trek universe, so many potential stories and characters they could have had, and this is what they have come up with? There is far better written stories with far superior plots written by fans. The 20 minutes of prelude to axanar has more depth then 3 episodes of STD whats supposed to be the best in the business?

Sickened by the positive discrimination that these producers show, they seam to be terrified to cast never mind lead role, who is not someone deemed to be in a minority or unrepresented group whether this is race, creed or sexuality.

Gees......Give us something after DS9, the Alpha quadrant is fractured after the Dominion invasion, there's loads they could do with Section 31, give us Q! give us some Star Trek!

STD, on the other hand, is as annoying as the itch the initials would suggest. Overly complicated, boring and, hopefully, not entering into series 3. If I could rate zero, I would.

"I will preface this with I am a huge Star Trek fan and a huge sci fi nerd so sometimes I can enjoy a Star Trek for the sci Fi element even though it's bad trek.

I have made it through the entire Trek catalogue in order of release up to this series and I have to say it was the hardest to sit through. For various reasons but mostly weak writing which led to all sorts of problems.

Season 1: This was ok, it introduces everyone and then introduces the bad guys. Which were Klingon. Unfortunately there is so much subtitle Klingon in this you had to read most of the season.

There is gratuitous sex and violence which I didn't mind but really didn't feel like Star Trek. Didn't like the main character she is a human raised as a Vulcan and of course they tie her into a very famous Vulcan and his family. It shows how weak the writing is when they can't develop new fresh characters.

Season 2 more of the same. Bad guys from S1 are still around but the toned down the subtitles and the main character flips from being a stoic pretend Vulcan to an emotional crying all the time type.

This emotional tugging at the heart strings works well, until it doesn't. They really overuse this formula.

Season 3 This is probably my favorite season. I really liked the bad guy. I should say the special effects and music are movie quality throughout all seasons. But that's where the likes end for me.

Everything feels flat and empty and it took me awhile to figure out why. The writing centers around the main character and she is the only one that can save the day. The other characters barely get a mention. So when it comes down to it you don't really have and characters you care about except for the main character and her being the only being in the universe that can save everyone all the time gets boring fast

Season 4 was so boring. There is no real bad guy. It would be like saying the villian in twister is the wind. But then imagine 12ish hours of people talking about how bad the wind is. Then suddenly because there is no depth one of the good characters becomes kind of bad but then isn't.

At this point the whole formula of there is a situation, only our main hero can save the day, but oh no she will have to sacrifice herself, cue tears, cue heartwarming goodbyes, oh she saved the day and herself rinse and repeat is so boring I almost gave up.

Needless to say I won't be tuning into Season 5.

I can only hope Picard isn't this bad. I could only recommend this to non Star Trek fans but it's barely ok sci Fi. There is so much better stuff out there, like literally and Star Trek that came before Discovery.",9 April 2018
Too many negatives to summarise... Pick some from the other reviews.,4 February 2018
"I am giving this new Star Trek series two stars for the following reasons: 1) The set was beautiful. You can tell that an entire crew worked long and hard, building a set that looked as though it belonged in a movie. Some of the cinematography blows you away. 2) The actors all seem to care about what they are doing and even if some of the acting is, at times, not so great (and these times were numerous, thanks to the situations the writers put the actors in), you can only do so much with what you are given. These are the only two reasons why this show deserves two stars.

Other than those reasons, I cannot recommend this show. It is painfully obvious that the writers (and anyone overseeing them) either did not do their homework when it comes to what Star Trek actually is or, even worse, they just did not care. I understand that it has been said that they decided to be 'loose' with the cannon. By loose, they mean that they don't intend to follow it at all. This should be considered a series based off the reboot, the new movies from 2009 forward. I would not recommend this show even if this were the case, however, it would make more practical sense to link the Kelvin Timeline to Discovery and I think educated Trekkies would go along for the ride.

Instead of doing this, they set it in the Prime Universe, and so the show should be held to the standards set by previous shows. That said, the writers have neglected intelligent storytelling that is based in sound reasoning and logic, stories that have a pragmatic approach in terms of what is possible within the world built and established thus far in the franchise. The very first scene of the first half of the two-part episode reveals this fact right away. What we are left with is a flashy series that is focused on action and surprise, not depth of content. It is a show that will not make you think. It is a show that is not optimistic about our future. It is a show that is not the vision Gene Roddenberry had when creating TOS and TNG; it is, in fact, very much the opposite. Many will enjoy it on a superficial level. I am afraid, for the science fiction community, that will not be enough.

Those in my family that were around when the TOS was first on TV state that they have messed up the Klingons, and that's saying something from a group of conservatives with big imaginations. To mess up a staple within the franchise is an epic failure.

CBS, creating a Star Trek Fee via All Access streaming, where you must sign up to watch in the U.S. (near $10 for no commercials), has made a big mistake with this show and its dissemination. If they reached out at all to fans while making this show (or even with the idea of streaming on All Access), it is not evident. No one is interested in signing up for another service, and that CBS and other networks are late to the streaming game is not our fault - we should not have to pay for their lack of foresight. This show is, sadly, the first Star Trek (anything - ever) that I will not recommend nor watch.",1 October 2017
"I agree with all of the bad reviews and scripts. The actors are given bad scripts so please give them some latitude; I am an actor so I feel for them. But, no Trek series or movie ever used the profanity that this series does. To what end? For what purpose? Do the writers not know their audience? The intelligence of their audience? Who wants to pay for this garbage? Can they not find more intelligent expressions, or as Spock called them, ""colorful metaphors"" to express feelings? Are we all middle school students who think cussing is cool? The writers need to be fired if they hope this series will survive.",24 January 2021
"EDIT: My previous 10/10 review was based on the first 4 or 5 episodes. The story begins a rapid collapse after that -- just diving into progressive trope. The bad guys have weird blood purity obsessions. When the good team uses a natural resource, they make the world better in complete defiance of all natural law. When the bad team uses that same natural resource, it threatens not only all life on a planet, not just all life in the universe, but all life in all universes -- I'm not exaggerating. Gay love is pure and transcends death itself. Straight love is, in every single case, based on deception, exploitative, and cruel. It just gets dumb and recycles every other SciFi show you've seen in the last 10 years. It also decided to drop the f-bomb, which I don't appreciate. Some of that I can take, but it went from 0 to 80 on terms of that stuff ... felt like a whole new writer took over. The acting was still strong throughout, as are the gorgeous sets, but the writing just tanked to the point that I couldn't finish the season. _______________________________________________________________________

The set design is absolutely gorgeous, giving a much needed upgrade to the old 60s set. As for story, TOS episodes fell into 3 categories -- Twilight Zone in space, overcome our enemies in space, and social justice in space. All were welcome, but the later series just bombarded us with social justice -- Discovery, 5 episodes in, concentrates on the first 2, and all centered around overcoming the enemy. In terms of the science, like TOS, you'll see some absurdities, like everything system on a ship going down except the ever-reliable artificial gravity -- and rather than trying to explain such things, it's just accepted as a necessary, not to be dwelt on. In terms of characters, TOS had the big three, representing emotion, logic, and arbitration of the two. Discovery has characters that you will recognize from the workplace -- rashness and fear, over-promisers and those refusing to change, the protagonist is something of an agent of chaos so far, but we'll see. I rolled my eyes when I saw that the main character would be a minority woman, but unlike the many other series, it doesn't feel like you're being hit over the head by a SJW. None of the characters are without real flaws, and their flaws seem quite necessary both for the drama, and possibly for the situation that they're in. I'll agree with those who say this does not fit in terms of taking place *before* TOS -- but I'm happy to get over that and enjoy great sci-fi drama in an exciting, beautiful world with people who read quite real. I LOVE IT!",11 March 2018
"I'm not a Trek purist, and while I've seen most of the versions of the franchise over the decades, I don't care very much about being ""true to the legacy"" as long as they're doing something entertaining.

And that's the problem. Take the 'Trek' out of it. It's simply awful sci fi, awful fiction, and awful TV. The scripts make no sense at all - they are cliche to the point that they are almost parody. The characters are uninteresting. The horrific, overbearing, overproduced score ruins the scenes. The CGI is expensive-looking, but looks very over-stylized and therefore fake, despite the attention it was given.

Frankly, I can't believe that the team that produced this, with all the time and resources they must have been given, and all the investment CBS is putting into it and their on-demand service, did such a god-awful job of it.

My wife and I watched season one all the way thru, thinking it had to get better as it went on. It really didn't, but we came in for season two all full of optimism again. We were a mix of bored and annoyed (the score is annoying!), and won't likely watch any more. What a disappointment.",21 January 2019
"Not a bad show but it feels like watching Gilmore Gilrs in space with all that endless yapping. All Characters should speak less and say more...

I prefer my sci fy full of lines such as the below :

There can be no justice so long as laws are absolute. Even life itself is an exercise in exceptions.

Discovery is an easy to watch action sci-fy series deprived of moral dilemmas, exploration and likable characters.",1 February 2019
"I am so tired of the lead in this show crying in every episode and whispering banalities. At home we just wait for the waterworks and the guess is how many minutes into the episode it takes. I generally just leave the room for about half the episode.

"Okay, not perhaps deserving of just one star. There are the occasional decent moments and characters that are barely okay. But this is not Star Trek. It is not even close to Star Trek. It certainly isn't canon. Most of the characters are unlikeable or unknowable. And the insipid spore drive makes a mockery of Star Trek Voyager where a poor ship was stranded in the Delta quadrant for seven seasons. Why not just use the spore drive, which recently allowed Discovery to travel to the far reaches of the Beta Quadrant?

That's it. Enough. Time to watch better science fiction shows like The Orville, Counterpart, The Expanse and others. Goodbye and good riddance.",8 February 2019
"Where is the depth of the original series'? And better yet of 'the Next Generation'? Where are the elaborated characters? The confronting of interesting problems and the mental journey of solving them? The revolutionary grasp of society, learning how to stretch our minds and understanding different cultures, races and sepcies? Where's the depth? The story keeps making huge jumps from one thing to the other and there's no clear mystery or challenge to keep a decent focus on.

Several cast members are real good actors, the uniforms and the scenery are fantastic. So are all visual effects, the cam work, the cinematography and the editing. Superb work. But the soul... man! Where is it? Why call it 'Star Trek' and completely destroy the franchise? Gene Roddenberry must be rolling in his grave.",30 January 2021
"I saw TOS when I was a kid, and I had a model Enterprise as a toy. It would even shoot little disks. I wanted to be like Spock, because what he does is logical. I loved the conflict between Bones and Spock, and Kirk having a laugh in between them. Then I wanted to be like Scotty, being able to repair everything, an excellent egnineer. I watched TOS, and did not like it. Non of the characters were likable. Watched DS9, and was not impressed. Star Trek without Space Ship? Then Voyager, great show, great captain, a woman finally, treating her crew with respect and the love of a mother, as you would expect. Great characters, from Kim to the Doctor, 7 of 9 and annoying but lovable Neelix. Along came Enterprise, looking more like a fan production and acting sometimes a bit of a miss. But the characters were lovable to, Trip, Archer, Reed, T'Pol, Flox, and Travis. And now this. Discovery: Dark, depressing and everyone whining. Everyone in the search for their inner me, solving their childhood problems, their emotional issues and who knows what other psychological problems. Character development: Michael only. We don't know anything about the other characters, apart that some are gay and some speak too much. Old Star Trek had one episode focusing on one character, allowing us to get to know him. in STD we get to know the character only when they Die. Watching Discovery has become a chore: I watch it because it has the name StarTrek, but has nothing of Star Trek. I watch it because so I can talk about it. I watch it in the hope of something better. I will not miss it if they don't extend for another season",3 April 2019
"I love Star Trek because I love the characters, the interaction, the dialogue. I love space dramas..there are a lot of them. This Star Trek is a space drama without the Star Trek heart. Everyone is angry, the captain is not a real presence. There are not any characters that I like. There is no banter, no team work, everyone seems out for themselves instead of pulling together to defeat the enemy. It is not the least bit friendly. It may have the Star Trek title..but it is not Star Trek",13 January 2019

"I cant seriously call this a Star Trek series, it's soo far from the essence of Star Trek that it feels almost criminal to use the name.

This could have been fine as another sci fi franchise, independent of Star Trek but as part of ST it's too far removed. There are also too many continuity issues which arise from this series and the series isn't strong enough for me as a trek fan to overlook them.

With all that said, this series does have some positive points.

For a ST series I cant rate this highly, however if this was a new independent franchise, then I'd actually rate it higher.",8 September 2020
"Wow what a really terrible show. not just bad star trek, but a really really reallllly bad piece of ""entertainment."" it's honestly hilarious watching cbs cannibalize its own properties to get this dumb all access crap off the ground. i don't see it lasting much longer. maybe a third season but there's no way it's still drawing viewers who honestly want to pay for it.",27 May 2019
"I am old enough to remember watching the Original Series when it first aired on television. Those episodes established Star Trek's ""canon"" (the material accepted as officially part of the story in the fictional universe of that story). Apparently, established canon means nothing to the Star Trek Discovery writers. For example, in the last TOS episode, ""Turnabout Intruder"", Captain Kirk specifically said that there were no female Star Ship Captains in Star Fleet. That is why his former love interest, Janice Lester, used the alien machine to exchange bodies with him; so that she could become the Captain of the Enterprise. Nothing against women, but since the events in Star Trek Discovery take place at least ten years before that episode, there should be no female Star Ship Captains. Thanks to Political Correctness, and the liberals in Hollywood, much of the TOS canon has been redacted and erased to appease certain groups.",6 February 2019
"I didn't mind paying $6 per month to watch this show. I didn't mind that it takes a dramatically different approach to past Star Trek series. And I like the improved CGI and production quality even if it makes STD seem technologically out of sync with the other Star Trek series. What bothers me is that the show seems intent on crossing lines it doesn't need to cross. It's attempt to push boundaries is clumsy and (so far) not well thought out or executed.

I was tolerating the series through the first 4 episodes, seeing the potential and trying to not get too wrapped up in the fact that it seemed so far off from how previous Star Trek series' have felt to me. I feel like I can appreciate them trying new things.

Then came episode 5. What I can't understand is why this show has to be rated MA. The F-bombs in episode 5 along with the other profanity had no place, and, in fact, felt utterly out of place especially for a show supposedly based on Star Trek. It was pretty sly and back-handed to all of a sudden throw shock profanity into a Star Trek series at episode 5. I'll admit I was shocked, just because it had no place, there was no reason for it. It's sheer laziness on the part of the writers. I expect them to show more creativity through meaningful dialogue and allow the improved CGI and production feel to drive to a more professional result. Don't just mimic the gritty language and darkness of other mainstream cable shows for whatever reason. If they think they need to do it to be relevant, it shows their ignorance and lack of creativity. Most viewers will respect and support a show that has strong dialogue and builds a compelling story and characters without the use of shock profanity or overt (in your face) sexual themes or nudity.

The gay insinuation was so poorly done and seemly out of context with what had previously transpired that all it did for me was feel clumsy and evoke all the old stereotypes. Regardless of how they develop this going forward, the leap was too big to make the way they did it. I feel that the writers are not honestly trying to approach boundaries that cause introspection or thoughtful consideration of issues or flawed characters, or they are pretty ignorant of how to treat sensitive topics with restraint, grace and feeling. It feels as if they are throwing the diversity spit wads against the wall and hoping they stick. What is missing is strong, compelling character development.

I realize that just the mystifyingly abrupt introduction of profanity in episode 5 would not justify a 4 rating. I'm still struggling with the fact that this is supposed to be based on Star Trek and yet feels overly gritty, dark, with so far mostly unlikable characters. Whatever humanity they have introduced so far has seemed forced, as if they are putting it in there out of obligation, not because they have any sense that it's what really causes us to be truly emotionally invested in a show. I'm hopeful some common sense will prevail and the writers/directors will iron this out. If what we have seen through 5 episodes is what we end up with after 15 episodes, it will not be sufficient to carry this series.

I'll continue to reserve more judgment and will keep trying this show for a while, but I hope the writers get it together. We need more humanity, stronger guiding principles, and more character development in order for this show to be worth our time.",18 October 2017

"I liked the first season of STD, but I think the second is even better. It has brought back some traditional Star Trek elements while maintaining the new twist. While The Orville has some great episodes, most are mediocre at best and drivel at worst. The acting in STD is soooooo much better than the acting in The Orville. I am glad I gave this iteration of Star Trek a chance and I'm glad to have found a show that I want to/will continue to watch as well as enjoy.",15 February 2019
"Pardon the rant on this one but as a Star Trek, Star Wars and science fiction fan in general I had to post something....

After growing up with reruns of the Original series, watching The Next Generation, DS9, Voyager, and Enterprise from premier to end this rates the bottom of the totem after the two episodes I'm hoping it gets better. I found two issues with the show and technical issue with the site.

One is the change varying tech, appearing more advanced than the New or old Original Star Trek series and this is supposedly a decade before Kirk.

Two the Klingon appearance I've seen change over the years I can almost roll with that and include experimentation and breeding that caused changes from 100 from Archer's Enterprise to this show but their language seems off, much harsher not like its original vocals. I also agree they act more like pirates or some crazed Romulan. Actually they look like the Reman from the mines of Remus in Star Trek Nemesis.

Technical issues: When I went to record Discovery on DVR the last 15 minutes were not recorded. I had to go pay for the CBS all Access and it was all over the place and I swear 15 commercials in 30 minutes. When I went to watch episode two my internet provider must have squeezed the streaming bandwidth or the site in general caused it to crash so didn't finish watching the episode. I will try again later. Its not economical to have to pay more for no commercials just for one show that I'd watch. I'd rather spend money on Disney or even SyFy channel my family and I watch more shows there. What also I did not like is that other countries have live TV access or netflix access to the show.

I was hoping for a better show for paying the money. For example Game of Thrones, True Blood or Westworld are worth paying 14.99 a month for plus the addition of other movies or possible new series that come about. CBS has a long way to go before they get there and sadly Disney will probably get there first with maybe paid addons to Netflix, Hulu I know that Amazon Prime has that option.

I will continue to pay till the end of the series then cancel, I do want to give them a chance but with CBS past with sci-fi series it will either be canceled soon or only be one season. Unless they start to listen to the fans the ones that are watching paying and not paying to see the series. The show and the network are nothing without an audience. I'll try and do a followup post at the end of the series run. thanks for hearing my mini rant.",25 September 2017
"Horrible! The acting is so bad, the plot is horrible and ridiculous. Barely has the structure of the classic series. This is the worst Star Trek implementation ever. Very very bad and sad. It's almost a soap opera. I am so disappointed. To anyone that has not watched The next Generation, Original series, Voyager or even Enterprise, just skip this show and go watch those which are ridiculously good and deep and brilliant. This is a cheap knock off and attempt of Star Trek. Its not worth the name and legend of the real Star Trek. And I cannot believe the high rating people are giving this crap. Have you watched the full Next Generation or all the later episode of Voyager season 3 thru 7? They are masterpieces and this new crap is an embarrassment of Star Trek. Even last seasons of Enterprise where getting pretty good by season 3 thru the end, season 4. How can you guys give it such high score? This is at best an bad attempt at a mediocre series. I can't believe the rating left by people is so high. It is definitely not worth the rating given and should be much much lower, at best 2 and a half starts.",5 April 2018

This new effort really falls short when they had such a huge amount to draw from when creating it.

It really does seem like they are actually trying to drive away a rather large part of the fanbase in order to push a political agenda.

"Boy did Netflix drop the ball on this one. It just got so melodramatic and cheesy. In almost every episode someone cries(mostly Michael Burnham), someone gives an inspirational speach, and so on. The most terrible thing was to watch Captain Pike telling more than once that the crew was ""his family"" or even worse, Spock saying ""I love you"". I must say that this second season was very hard to end watching. I cringed at every one of those excesive cheesy lines or scenes. I would cut some slack to the actors an even the directors, though, they just work with the material they are given. I blame the writers and the producers. Having watched every Star Trek series and movies, I must say that this one goes very far from what Star Trek is about. Granted, human relations are an important part of this show, but this time they just overdid it. I share most of the negative reviews . I just wonder how does it get kind of a high score.",3 August 2020

Fancy effects and flat characters, the exact opposite of everything Star Trek. This might appeal to new audiences who know nothing of Star Trek based on special effects, but any fan of the franchise will be seriously disappointed. Roddenberry is screaming and yelling from his grave. The portrayal of the Klingons is downright insulting. They look like LOTR orcs, and act like mindless barbarians. Klingons are a proud race of warriors, not mindless barbarians. In fact, everything about this series so far is a complete insult to the franchise and its' fans.",30 September 2017

Better to remember Star Trek as it was than to pollute my brain with this mediocre, disorganised waste of money.

"Ok, the good stuff - Finally a Star Trek series after so many years. Great sets, wonderful effects courtesy of modern CGI, some great tech and clever plot development - in Season 1. Onto Season 2 and the disappointing / bad stuff. First off, loose the obsession with Michael Burnham. Basically a single character, soapy drenched tragic waste of what Discovery could be. Next, instill some consistency (canon). Discovery has area of more tech that NG but is a century earlier. With a bigger budget and capacity for production, Discovery could (and needs) to be so much more given the subject matter. I get it that there needs to an element of human relationship dynamics but let's loose the soap avalanche available in a million rubbish series elsewhere. Hopefully those responsible for the forthcoming series 3 will take this and other constructive criticisms on board.",1 March 2020
"I like countless star trek fans waited for several years in abatement to watch STD, but i can see this was the most tepid, uninspiring series that of star trek that i've ever watched so far. Besides the usual list of grouses like Klingons, CGI and lens flare there are other disappointments such a profanities which make up as filler for the absence of good dialogues, star trek was more about talk and less action. The story lines are largely absent, there would be 2-3 micro stories within an episode in the old star trek's which often built up characters. Instead what we have is some jargon prattling uniforms running around with spaceship sounds from TOS in the background. I tried to watch beyond episode 3 and I can't even bear to watch it anymore, its simply dreadful and beyond fixable.

It was so boring! I had to fast forward multiple times. What are they trying to do with the Klingon's? Where is the peaceful Star Trek about ironically, Discovery?

Well I have managed to endure the first three episodes and it feels like I have stepped on some crap lying on the road. Everything about this series is wrong. The technology doesn't align with the period. The aliens are done wrong - the Klingons are a caricature who behave and speak like zombies. There is a token alien on the bridge, Saru, who doesn't have any distinctive quality or personality. The starfleet personnel do not have any sense of camraderie nor principles. There is very low illumination in most of the scenes which makes it difficult to follow what is happening.

"Every true ""Trekkie"" worth his/her salt can see the many issues this show has. It does not line up with Trek lore in many areas. The level of tech advancement is far higher than shows that take place well afterward. It introduces alien species, major species with major storylines, never seen or heard of again in the multiple shows and movies that take place afterwards. It includes alien species previously unknown to the characters in shows and movies that take place afterwards. It introduces yet a third incarnation of the Klingon species in look, style and design.

Star Trek: TOS and Star Trek: The Next Generation were about the ship and its crew seeking out new life. Star Trek: Deep Space 9 was about a space station in deep space called Deep Space 9. Star Trek: Voyager was about a crew and its ship, aptly named Voyager, thrusted against their will 75 years away from and is about the crew on their 'voyage' home. All simple plot outlines, all written masterfully. Star Trek: Discovery is about...well I'm really not sure. Something about a ""Spore Drive"" and heavy follows the vague storyline of one Michael Burnum and occasionally includes some other character's goings on. Aimless and pointless the show somehow drones on, wreaking havoc on the Star Trek universe and its lore that so many fans hold dear.

This show will fail unless they make a drastic change back to the atmosphere of Star Trek from the 1990s and before.

Those appreciating character development, episodic story lines and room to get to know the wider crew will be disappointed. The lack of subtlety when trying to reflect modern social issues is a big disappointment (in comparison to how Data/Worf/Troi in TNG).

If your new to Star Trek and want to watch a show where characters get some time to develop, Strange New Worlds is closer to the historical ""trek""format, if you have no frame of reference, Discovery may be to your taste.

"Season 1 is tolerable every now and then. While Season 2 is a chore to get through. Season 1 never establishes any worth or meaning to Starfleet and its ideals. So any larger philosophical drama has no weight. The characters, with the exception of Lorca, Saru, and occasionally Stamets, are uninteresting at best and severely annoying at worst. The Klingons are one-dimensional and dull so any action or threat is rendered meaningless. The mirror universe stuff is okay but somehow is simultaneously stretched out and not fleshed out enough to be enjoyable. (3.8/10)

Season 2 is awful. Pike is well done and a fun character. But Burnham is even more annoying in this season than the previous. The writing is sloppy and the overblown melodrama is amped up to eleven. (2/10)

I just finished season 2 and I really don't even want to think about starting season 3.",4 January 2021
"All action, cgi, and sensational drama. Nothing thought provoking. Nothing that inspires appreciation of the unknown. The hook; a bizarre, multidimensional mycellial network, serves as deus ex machina and inspires no real mystery.

Many placating semi-modern themes that are just thrown in to widen viewer demographics, create a sense of familiarity, or bludgeon the viewer with a sense of normalcy (rather than ever challenging our sensibilities with forward thinking in provocative ways, like good art does).

It's an edge-of-your-seat, hollow thriller. About as phillosophical as a Marvel movie. It's just eye candy for low brow viewers.Cgi showcase for the lowest common denominator.",31 October 2020
If you have a little love for Star Trek stay away from this abomination.,15 May 2019
"I wanted so much to like Star Trek Discovery, but season 3 has become almost unbearable to watch. The amount of melodrama is ridiculous. I simply don't understand why everything has to be an occasion for waterworks and overly dramatic music. Such a huge budget and so much anticipation from trekkies squandered on cheap melodrama.",7 December 2020
"Answer: A whole helluva lot.

The worst part of this show are the Klingons. First, they do not look like Klingons. They are all BALD. They look like a bunch of goofballs at a costume party wearing plastic masks. Why would the writers decide to reboot the Klingons and make them nothing at all like the Klingons in previous Star Trek series? OK OK, in the first iteration of Star Trek, the Klingons looked a little bit Oriental with their Fu Manchu beards etc.... But who cares? They weren't really all that central to the episodes in the original series. The Klingons from the later series who figured more prominently in various story lines looked pretty menacing with their long hair and hardcore body armor. The new Klingons in Discovery look like they should be called the BALD - headed reptilian fish wannabes. They look more in appearance like the Orks in LOTR than they do like ""traditional"" Klingons. Furthermore, their manner of talking reminds me more of Jaba the Hutt from Star Wars than what we have come to associate with Klingons in Star Trek. It is very disrespectful to lifelong Trekkies to mess with the Klingons in this way.

Prediction: This show will not last very long.",26 September 2017
Such a cheesy acting and dialogs you can compare it with indian soap drama. Had to quit after 6 episodes and really wanted to give it a chance. Not a hater of remakes/new series but it's just terrible.,9 April 2019
"Sorry but this was awful....but the best thing was i found myself watching a comedy turn from Kryten (Red Dwarf) aka Lt.Saru!!

He's a direct incarnation from the legendary UK space comedy drama! Wont be watching this rubbish after the dreadful pilot - another wasted modern opportunity blown.",28 September 2017

"Definition of ""legacy"", by Merriam-Webster: 1 :a gift by will especially of money or other personal property :bequest She left us a legacy of a million dollars. 2 :something transmitted by or received from an ancestor or predecessor or from the past the legacy of the ancient philosophers The war left a legacy of pain and suffering.

In the last few years of my job, our company spoke of removing ""legacy"" systems and processes to be replaced by new, fresh ideas. That's great in the corporate world, but to do that to our cultural legacies is akin to treason.

There are reviewers who speak of those like me - we who promote the preservation of our greatest arts, including the foundational ideas which they were created from. I say to those reviewers, shall we ""reimagine"" Star Wars? Maybe Anikan was autistic, or maybe Anikan/Vader was Luke's mother. Maybe Han was a military veteran-gone-rogue. Maybe Chewie was a hairy unicorn. Maybe Padme has special magical powers. Maybe Luke was heavily tattooed. Maybe Leia was a clone, instead of a twin, designed to destroy the Jedi. ""Believe me"". In twenty years, when your truly precious things in life are being ""reimagined"" to grab the dollars of the younger generation and present it to you as a regurgitation of what you once loved, you'll feel the same way.

If CBS and all involved didn't call this ""Star Trek"", it could've gotten away with a ""loosely based on the legacy of Gene Rodenberry"". But, no. You named it, now you own it, and now you will hear from those who expect it to follow and honor the legacy of Gene Rodenberry - not eat it whole then puke it out into a pile of something unfamiliar, only littered with some edible bits hoping those like me will pick those out of your trash and eat it like it's all that is left in the world for us.

My official rating is due to this show being named ""Star Trek"". That being said, if this was NOT packaged as ""Star Trek"", and only loosely based on that which should not have been desecrated. If I never knew what Star Trek was - never heard of such a thing, I would give a rating of 6/10, and would give this show time to develop.

Here's what's wrong with this show in the first two episodes: 1. The opening titles with score reminds me of the trend that started with 'Six Feet Under' (HBO...1990's) and has blown up recently. Great for a dramatic, quirky show, but for this show it's like whoever was responsible for that doesn't understand cohesion and likes to jam square pegs into triangular holes. I receive no joy from the score. None. 2. Our lead character, though Human, was raised a Vulcan. Right out of the gate I, or anyone left with with a soul here, do not and cannot relate to her. I imagine even the best trekkers out there don't know enough about life on Vulcan to understand her inner-conflicts. Flashbacks did not help - they were useless to help us understand her. Her character should've been supporting - not primary. And, the lead is not the leader. Interesting, and acceptable, if you gave me something to care about her character. I don't. As a matter of fact, I disliked her. 3. War - out of the gate. Klingons are now the greatest threat to Human kind, and we're a threat to their kind. Or is it really Nationalism and Isolationism vs Race-Blending and Globalization? They're very religious. They mock ""we come in peace."" because they know from experience that's bull. Who's the enemy here? It seems the creators are pandering to two audiences. The ones who have to pay for all-access, and the ones who have to pay for Netflix. 4. There are more colors in the spectrum than Blue, Silver and Gold. 5. Star Wars? Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009)? Babylon 5? The borrowing from those is embarrassing, feels like a combination of more pandering and a lack of originality. 6. Not a fan of naming the lead ""Michael Burnham"". Not because the character is a woman; but, because I don't like the symbolic implications. Some try to say character names mean nothing, while I know very well that naming a character is about what you are trying to say about not only that character but the larger theme. Burn 'em all, Michael; Burn em' all, eh? Not a fan of the implication, considering the chaotic hell we live in today. She should've been named ""Gabriel Windham"".

And, what I did like, if this wasn't packaged as ""Star Trek"": 1. The actor who plays Saru is well-acclaimed. He is currently doing the best acting in the show, and wonderfully acts the role/script he was given. I wasn't happy that such a fearful character was on the bridge, but his explanation for, and his delivery of why he is that way was the finest moment of acting, dialogue, and characterization in those two episodes. 2. Cinematography - good job. Not exactly ground-breaking, but a beautiful whole. 3. Burnham's logical conversation with the ship's computer - good moment. 4. Opposite the view of many reviewers, I liked Captain Georgiou. Through all of my favorite sci-fi shows, their first seasons were always rough, but the good actors, if playing interesting characters, and supported by the finest writing, always raised the bar by season 2, and nailed it by season 3. If only she was the focus...",29 September 2017
"This show is nothing like Star Trek, at least in previous versions the characters interacted with each other, sometimes with a bit of humor, things were more relaxed and fun even during a crisis. I watched the first episode and there was nothing but chaos for the whole show, crisis upon crisis, everyone panicking, a lot of warp speed dialogue that was hard to follow. The show is a typical Hollyweird SJW effort. Painfully obvious forced diversity. I see that the whole cast ""took a knee"" for support of the NFL. This show is not worth watching.",26 September 2017
"No continuity with the previous star trek series, if they insist on using loads of cgi and changing the look of the Klingon's etc they should have set it in the future after TNG then it would have worked better, some people who haven't seen the previous series may like it but for me it just doesn't work, reminds me of lord of the rings which is great but isn't star trek! Its just like every modern sci-fi series",7 November 2017
This is nothing like the normal star trek. They have instead chosen to go the route of the films. Losing all of the values of the original shows of a better world and replacing it with the modern movie hero journey. They've ruined Klingons and the science makes no sense. Trying too hard to make a strong female lead instead of just picking an actress who can actually portray a strong character. Now it seems to be about the ego and glory of one character. A far fling from what turned the real star trek into a cult following. I have no idea how it has a 7 rating on imdb.,7 January 2018
"The story is so disappointed, this series is all about burnham, burnham this, burnham that. It so annoying to see the burnham. Spock, Capt. Pike, Lorca and Phillipa are the only character I found entertaining so far. I found Saru and Tilly a bit annoying. Esp Tilly, this character is a joke to me, they should kill this character at first place. And there are to many liberal agendas on this series. When I read some comments here, and the development of season 3, I expecting things get better. Quite happy with the season 3 ep. 1, but after that it all went back to the track as season 1 and 2. For me this is a ""Star Trek: Burnham"". I think I might watch old Start Trek series again.",18 November 2020
"In the beginning of the first episode Burnham predicted (with Spock like attitude) to the second when a storm will arrive. Just minutes later she admitted, that the prediction was wrong. Well and this is the whole description of Discovery. Insert some well known Star Trek references and features, but then do nothing about it. Great visual effects, dialogues with the pace and quality of a middle school play, so far flat characters, chaotic stories with obvious Star Trek references or with reaction to some present social event. I am really sorry to see this show under Star Trek franchise. I dream about Jean Luc Picard appearing from parallel universe on the Orville and staple it as an official Star Trek sequel :)",21 April 2018
"The special effects are good, but considering the tech level these days it is not surprising. Everything else is found lacking. Sadly to me it appears as if this show has taken political correctness as a primary driver, and quality of the show as a far and distant second. And what in the world did they do to klingons...",5 October 2017
"It is disrespectful of the franchise to call this show Star Trek. This is especially true given that this is only 10 years before ST:TOS. There is zero effort to be a true prequel to TOS. No ships or tech resemble in any way Kirk's Enterprise or the world of that era. It doesn't need to truly look like 1960's Sci-Fi. But all tech looks better and more advanced than any other ST. This world is more negative, more combative, humorless, and dark, with none of the positive vision that drove Gene Roddenberry to create ST in the first place. He wanted to show that we could be better in the future than we are today. This show is 300 years in the future but we look and act exactly the same as we do today. We may end up that way, but shouldn't we be hopeful, at least?

Now, as to the show itself, there is far too much going on, too many characters coming and going, it's hard to care about any of them. I'm only on SE01:EP05 and I will keep watching because I have to. But I am not looking forward it.",24 February 2020
Not sure why but S3 took a sharp turn down regarding acting and plot. It just sucks now. Such a shame aswell as the first two seasons it actually seemed like the actors were having fun and giving it there all. Now the actors just be acting poorly. Ah well maybie it'll get better but I doubt it...,3 December 2020

"I am a huge fan of TNG, DS9, and enjoy the others in the series quite a bit. This, is not star trek. This is star wars with star trek characters. I knew it was going to be a problem after the recent movies which were all action based nonsense, designed to follow the success of the newer star wars movies. That was never the focus of trek, and this show is a disgrace to the name.

ON TOP of that they gate it behind cbs all access, which has an -extra- cost even if you already pay for cbs on your cable bill. Get out of here. No way I will bother with this.",3 December 2017
"It's one thing rebooting a show, it's quite another to rewrite it and ensure it has absolutely no resemblance whatsoever to the original material, while simultaneously offending the entire fanbase in one fell swoop. It simply doesn't want to be associated with Star Trek.

It's as if someone at CBS said ""here, do what you want with it, now go make us loads of money"".

The writing is terrible, the special effects are good. Without the VFX it would be utterly pointless, which is precisely the opposite of previous trek where VFX were above average, but story telling was superb.

Compare that to something like Thrones where both writing and VFX are above par. Garbage like this won't stand the test of time, because generic action and generic visual effects become cheaper as time goes on, so in the end all that is left is cliche tired plots with no emotional investment.",22 December 2018
"Wow, from weak, wooden, uninspiring actors to politically correct pacifist lefty plots, no other word for it, dire. Even the Klingons made Corbyn / Saunders look like warmongers!! This effort was a waste of hard to come by production capitol. Is there no one left in TV with the man parts to produce some real honest to goodness action SciFi without pandering to the virtue signaling classes. Don't waste any more money on this dross, or at least get a director with some testosterone..... ( Held back to spare the blushes of those involved in this ;) )",25 September 2017
"All these positive reviews must be paid for because it does not deserve this rating!

Please do not look at this series as any sort of Star Trek series, the ""Klingons"" drive me to insanity with their stupid voices/language and general demeanor, ""orcs in space"" is a wise accusation. The pandering to the masses with their PCness, fearing any sort of white male lead roles pisses me right off (I'm a woman).

This show is an offense to the Star Trek series. I was so excited for a new series but I've gone back to watching Voyager and other older series instead!",17 October 2017
"In general, the first two episodes are mediocre. The writing was average. The integration into the Star Trek universe was ham-fisted.

There were so many ways to go with the story (eg a bit into the future, with the Federation breaking down or non-functional ie something that considers the bigger, deeper challenges of being human), ways that could have built on what had gone before philosophically at least. Instead, it feels like trying to ram an octagonal peg into a hexagonal hole.

I'll keep watching at this point, to give it the benefit of a lot of doubt. But I doubt it'll be worth it.",25 September 2017
"There's no wonder, no imagination, no hope of a better future, no dream of humanity spanning star systems. None of the viewers of this show have ever even considered laying on the grass on a starry night and wondering what might be.

There is nothing inspirational about Discovery at all. I grew up wanting to live out my life on the starship Enterprise. I couldn't last more than a week in the company of these terrible people.

The science is gone, the fiction is atrocious. Space ships and holograms must mean sci-fi to these writers, they have gravely misunderstood the mental calibre of their audience, and instead made garbage for idiots, yet again.

The writers and producers of Star Trek Discovery have vandalised a 50 year legacy, and they don't even care, they think that they are doing no wrong.

They will be remembered as those who killed off a cultural icon for bank balances.",23 May 2018
"I give them two stars for some nice visual effects. I feel that many other negative reviews already echo the same complaints I have so I won't repeat much.

In short, the characters are uninteresting and the plot feels too simplistic. Not every episode was great in other series, but I will say that most were very solid because of a moral/philosophical quandary being posited. You can see them struggle to provide this, but it's more like an obvious choice that you're waiting for the character to finally make; nothing ambiguous about it.

This is outside the scope of the show itself, but I also rate this very poorly for its execution. Really weird to see them lock this into a niche streaming service (who wants to subscribe to CBS of all things?) and therefore clearly being used as a driver to get subscribers.",23 October 2017
"It was painful to watch each episode with so much liberal SJW crap propaganda. And by the way the first officer, Michael fits just right in, is annoying overbearing and arrogant like a typical snowflake. Another series destroyed by political agenda.",10 April 2019
"I am a true fan of Sci-Fi and I love stories that extends known technological theories and break boundaries of my imagination. There are a lot of good movies and series out there and among the best of them are Star Trek. Instead of boldly going into the unknown in a true Sci-Fi way, I think Star Trek Discovery is getting deeper into and stuck in the mundane shallow YouTube style of everyday drama. I may sound conservative, but I am certain of that the Star Trek founder would have disapproved. I watch Sci-Fi for the enjoyment of a fairly probable and exiting future given by the story and also as an inspiration and a motivator to do good in my everyday life, but this series gives me very little of that. My voice is only one voice, but the majority of the written reviews are more or less in line with my own review and I can only hope that the creators of Star Trek Discovery will read those.",13 April 2019
"It rather looks like Mission Impossible - full of action and no deeper meaning. The same applies for all 3 recent Star Trek movies. Nothing common with Original series or TNG, totally different format. And yes, Klingons look terrible. Even Orville (parody on Star Trek) has at least something common with Star Trek. Star Trek was never based on action, it was always based on interesting topics, science, cosmos, thoughts...",28 September 2017
"I signed on to CBS to watch the superbowl and thought I would give this a try, I've been a fan since the origianal series. The first episode was confusing but I soldiered on. I made it to episode 5 before cancelling my CBS subscription. The final straw was the constant Klingon dialog in Klingon. Not only do the klingons look weird (way overboard in the prosthetics), they only speak in Klingon which isn't an actual language despite what die hard fans think. This forces you to read subtitles which makes no sense when every other character speaks english. When the klingons speak they sound constipated. You can tell the actors are struggling to speak in a non existent dialect. This would be fine for an episode to establish the characters but they take it too far. It feels like the show is trying too hard to be different from all the other series. No cohesion, no wonder, no inspiration for the future. just dark and full of death. Every character is despicable and you hope they are the next to die. not a good formula for a succesful show.",5 February 2019
"Its hard to imagine a television show made over 50 years ago with its writers, directors and special effects puts Star Trek Discovery (entire series) to shame. This show is inept at doing anything like the original or any of the other series for that matter. That simply being able to tell a entertaining story. Such a let down.",30 November 2020
"And this is coming from a long term trekkie, who is willing to forgive almost anything Star Trek. First season was forgivable, second season is just horrible. Star Trek is an adventurous romp through the galaxies, with strong leads, both male and female. Star Trek: Discovery is instead a dour melodrama. Instead of a strong female character. Cmdr. Burnham is a sniveling lost wimp. I have to admit she is a good weeper and crier, she certainly does it often enough. They have even succeeded in turning Spock into a sniveling, deranged idiot. This series is an insult, both to Star Trek and to the fans. It's an absolute waste of money to subscribe to CBS All Access for this series. I'd give it a negative 10 rating if I could.",12 April 2019
The hallmark of Star Trek has always been its upbeat and mostly positive view of the future. This dark and disgusting version is not worth the cost to join CBS All Access or the time wasted watching it. Hopefully it will end with season one and be quickly forgotten. The Orville on FOX is what Discovery should have been.,17 October 2017
"Acting was a bit sloppy but bearable. Though animation was way better than star trek enterprise and slightly ahead in terms of texture animation to Orville. I usually don't read plots, so i'm surprised to find that its only dated 10 years before the rebooted movies, lol. That would make any events here unneeded in a major way.

I wonder why IMDb rated this 7+ when almost everybody rated this badly.

I also didn't get the logic on why you placed a traumatized officer on deck. Where's the humor here? Its so dark, and when does the actual discovering happen?",26 September 2017

No. I hope they show Part II next week - and if so I will hope for improvement. Otherwise, I will simply give up on the series. I was so hopeful, but (so far) this is the Star Trek series I like the least.",27 September 2017
"I preface this review with a statement I best believe qualifies my absolute devotion to the overall Star Trek Universe and more importantly, to its noble communitarian ideals: I want Discovery to do well because it is the most agreeably viable outcome with the widest distribution curve in a merit-based system representing a cross section of humanity (or whatever we evolve into). That being said, Discovery has fought tooth and nail for its place in the heavens. However, even among friendly contenders such as the Star Trek Picard fan base, its warp engines seem to have sputtered and then stalled. Okay, this was not an anticipated reaction but nor was it a total surprise either. However, the LGBT community from what I gather, likewise does not seem all that enthusiastic about its syndication despite their growing visibility on set. Discovery is a relatively successful show, its overall reception nevertheless remains rather, ho-hum; which begs the question: How well is it doing... really?

Personally, it's still a challenge trying to gauge its trajectory. Discovery had a very strong start back in 2017. After six or seven episodes however, its popularity began to wane though not enough to threaten its existence. Even so, I took a hiatus from from all-things-Trekkian, at least on celluloid; I still read scores of books produced by my favorite authors of the franchise, and will continue doing so in the foreseeable future. What dissolved my cinematic participation were the new combinatorial strategies for casting people of color, particularly of African descent: Gumbyism or non-white, very masculine females, who risk their occupations, welfare, indeed their very lives for the good of everybody else (usually white), but almost never black etcetera; (I wanted to enumerate them but its too depressing)

What brought me back into the fold, after missing all of season three and most of season two, was seeing Booker and the good captain hit it off. I miss this. As beautiful as it was to behold, it was an absolute breech in protocol regarding people of African descent. In the 2020s, black females are NOT to be paired with other black males! Interracial relationships with white males are strongly encouraged -if not, then lesbian relationships. This was the case in season two of Discovery; also in How to get away with Murder 2014-2020; also with The Foundation 2021; and The Wheel of Time 2021; and Spiderman: No Way Home 2021, as with Station Eleven 2021, as with Arcane 2021, as with The Expanse 2015-2021, The Boys 2019, Carnival Row 2019, as with so many others. The list is legion. Naivete might convince some, perhaps many, that this is merely forward progress in 'race relations'. But it feels more like a vicious campaign aimed primarily at reducing black numbers through the soft power of entertainment media; in this case, movies. And if the old saying about 'art imitating life, imitating art' holds, then we can only expect to see more of this play out in real life.

I don't know how long their relationship will endure, but I do hope for a good while.",18 December 2021
"I'm a long time fan of the Star Trek series, an original Trekkie from the late 60's, I had such high hopes for a new show and then all my hopes shot down in flames, this is not Star Trek, I don't know what it is but it's not following the same theme. I won't repeat what the others have said but they are dead on, what a shame, poor acting and no leadership, and most of the main stars are very political and should never bring their personal beliefs up that just hurts the fan base, they alienate a lot of fans, I'm sorry to say this show won't last and it's gonna hurt the franchise.",13 November 2017
"I watched the first episodes and now during its recess it is likely I wont return. I just found ""The Orville"" and from my point of view this is really the end for STD. Comparing the two series is interesting: STD is monochromatic with an always boring conflict between Federation and Klingons who seem came from a Carnival party instead of a warrior world; Orville is intelligent, has sense of humor and deals with conflicts we could expect in a multi-planetary-etnic-cultural society. Guess what series Gene Rodenberry would prefer ?",26 December 2017
"Pure feminist propaganda from the beginning. Michael is the main character, a women. On a show which is mostly watched by men and was alway intended for men. It was always a story of friendship and showing how to lead a team the right way. The show's goal is to show young people who have intetests in science (which are mostly male) what will be possible the future. Even if you can forgive the strict replacememt of men with women in good leadership position and giving the bad one to men, you can not enjoy the display of homosexual men kissing. How should anybody who is not gay (which most of humanity is not) enjoy it. And after all that, the repeating implication that everybodys opinion is equal and that bad people are those who believe in strenght is utterly digusting. Is the Saudis view of womens rights equal to the obes of the west? This is all propaganda of radical leftists. But fortunately unlike honest stories like the original Star Trek, oropaganda is alway forgotten quickly. Star Wars and co. are all stories written for men. Women and Homosexuals should have their own stories and not steal others.",30 January 2018
"Technically done admirably. Story is compelling,,all actors are up to the task, visuals are great, directed like a true professional would, however some scenes made me puke. The subtleness of previous star trek spin offs is gone, and they openly advocate for LGBT minority in this show, I guess they wanted everyone to like the show, possibly to make more money. Everything Gene Rodenberry wanted this show to be is now gone. I grew up watching star trek, and all I can say is: childhood ruined, although after some googling I found out even next generation spin off was a hoax. To think I started drinking earl gray tea because of cpt. Picard. Not sure what to say really. Threw all of star trek dvds to garbage, cancelled my netflix subscription and uninstalled star trek online. I hope I'll die soon.",22 February 2018
"Star Trek used to make you think, check and question your morals, overcome prejudice and small-mindedness, and inspire hope for a better future.

This action-and-tears show does nothing of the kind: An insecure, yet stubborn, and supremely unrelatable main character is time and again told that she is the only one fit to save the day (and the universe). She feels out of place, she has changed (yes, she cries more), she doesn't know if she can take it anymore (I can't).

The overall premise of season 3 could actually be interesting. Cut out the weeping and soft music and there'd be 25 more minutes per episode for character development and actual story-line.

I am sure, though, JJ Abrams loves the show as is. Just his kinda thing. And TNG's Wil Wheaton can henceforth claim to have portrayed a grounded, brave and likable character.",26 November 2020
"I kinda liked the captain but the main character was just making dumb decision after dumb decision. Seemed like everything that went wrong was all her fault. We are told that she is smart but its told, not shown. Her giving the number of seconds before the storm hit was a dumb scene. All the scenes with the Klingons were slow and boring. Also it causes continuity issues. It seems like they are setting up a long arc with the Klingons which I'm not looking forward to. Also, why did they give a female character a male name? It was really odd.

Despite the many issues with the series so far, i thought the show was watchable. Certainly not worth paying for though.",26 September 2017
"The only thing Star Trek about this show is its name, and that is a real shame. Star Trek has been a great sci-fy vehicle for decades and has had many great shows and movies.

"...you know that the writters are bad.

BUT if you put this bad writing into a very colourful universe (or multiverse) with a lot of depth and you throw enough money and decent actors at it something almost watchable comes out.

"The first season is trying too hard to win fans over by massive visual effects. No doubt, the VFX are on par, but what the series lacks are great episodes.

The overall story ark might be compelling, but what Star Trek is all about seems to be hidden from the view of the director and producers. Every season of every Star Trek series was judged by the quality of single episodes. And this series does not have on great episode that can stand on its own.

In TNG (and even VOY) every episode is a great story of its own, a 45 minute experience that can stand on its own and be judged as such. But discovery takes another path. It tries too hard to feed the overall story ark and this is where it ultimately fails.

They story ark might be quite interesting, seeing the Klingon empire rise, but the episodes fall behind. As a side note, the main character is utterly unlikeable. Bad actor and badly written character.

What fans were hoping for was a revival of TNG, but what they got was a 7 hours long movie that stretches so far it grows weary of itself and becomes thin like butter spread on too much bread.",22 July 2018
"I was really looking forward to seeing this as Star Trek is something I loved to watch as a child, then later with my own children. It has always been good to watch as a family but not this one.

It is nothing like Star Trek should be. There are no lighter moments it's very dark and even disturbing at times. I loved the old series for the mixture of serious themes but also the fun side that was always there.

I watched the first series with an open mind and knew there would be inconsistencies with technology, uniforms, alien races etc but I feel this should not have the Star Trek name at all. There isn't even one character I can warm to. And as for the captain....! I'll say no more, except that I won't be watching the next series!",17 November 2017

"When I decided to give my opinion about the newest member of the Star Trek universe I didn't know how to do so without overwhelming the reader, that's how many objections/critiques/complaints I had. I will zoom in on just three for the sake of clarity and help others who want to contribute to the Trek universe.

Limited exposure of other characters is my first complaint. The show focuses on just one character, this is a massive about face of EVERY SHOW that have graced the ""screen"" since the inception of the Trek world. Every main character has one or two episodes a season where this character stands out and is expanded upon while tackling the story line along with any moral lesson(s) the story might teach. Not all lessons are of great import. ""Data's Day is simply Data writing to a scientist telling him about his day. Also not every character highlighted in an episode is a main character such as "" Lower Decks"" was about the average day of four junior officers. This variety keeps the show fresh and gives the writers room to maneuver so to speak where the only limitation is the writer's imagination. This brings me to my second objection, the show has just one plot through out the entire season. Huh!? I suppose if the plot is intriguing and captivating, but an entire season? No, my reasons for the first complaint apply to this one as well.

The third complaint is altering already known elements or inserting elements never known. Case in point are the Klingon species. Their appearance has been RADICALLY changed so much that Trek fans had to be reintroduced to this species. The Klingon's physical characteristics are not the only changes,their mannerisms, beliefs as well as their interactions with each other reminded me of a cult rather than a race of warriors. This much I know Lieutenant Worf(oops Captain) would be very disappointed.

These changes are bad enough but the actress who plays Michael made a comment to reporters that leads me to think she hasn't really watched Star Trek. She was responding to a reporter's comments on STD being a bit more gritty than what the fans expected. She said real life is gritty. This implies previous shows stayed away from topical issues never contributing to dialogue pertaining to what was concerning people at that time. That is ridiculous, take the two part episode where Picard is captured by the Cardassians and tortured him until he was rescued. The torture scenes were right on the money revealing torture's true intent was/is humiliation, degradation, and remove all semblance of how the victim identifies himself and his place in the world so that he can be molded into what ever the torturer desires. We know this through the dialogue that takes place between Picard and his torturer. The episode was successful because in part to Amnesty International being consulted. Star Trek is loved because it shows us what we were,what we are and what we will become. We are wiser than what we were and will become wiser than what we are now. Those are the thoughts I always came away with at the end of each episode of each show until now. Thank God (and Netflix) for reruns.",27 November 2017
"OK, it's 5 episodes in and my initial thought is getting stronger. WHY?

Do I like this new series?, No I don't think I do. It's just not Star Trek. It could be OK sci first but not Trek.

Why? Too many changes. It's 10 years before TOS with Kirk Et-Al, but it feels way more advanced. The ships sleeker, it's faster, it's got more fire power, it feels bigger... Need I go on?

The Klingons simply aren't Klingons in looks and mannerisms, I don't know why they are even called Klingons other than to lure Trekkies and wanna be Trekkies in.

The acting is stilted, the writing formulaic at best, oh and the effects... expensive and uninspired, the same old CGI with lens flares a la everything since JJ did his reboot.

So, I ask, is it worth continuing? Nah, it simply ain't worth the effort. Goodbye new ""Trek"" welcome back Kirk, Picard and all that boldly went before, I'm revisiting them all instead",21 October 2017

"I hated season 1 (which I rate at 2-3 stars) for many reasons described better by native English speakers in reviews here. So I didn't have high hopes for season 2. However it appears that they've gone back to the roots now - although there are still continuity issues with the previous series regarding tech etc.

I'd recommend people who've bailed on Discovery because of season 1 to give season 2 a chance...

Edit: Dec 2020: Unfortunately season 3 so far is almost as bad as season 1, some episodes even worse.

Edit: February 2022 Season 4 is practically unwatchable. All pretense of caring about story and making quality sci-fi is gone. It's full steam ahead with the soap opera woke train and it is unbelievably cringe worthy. I'm out.",28 January 2019

They could just have left out the male actors, the few that are in star tears dosnt fit in this female cry/tears universe.

In terms of Star Trek, it's an abomination. But apparently the producers see that they burned 90% of all Star Trek fans and are now struggling to do ""fan service"" to recover from their abysmal mistake.

I'm not going to forget or forgive them, for their tragic error. But... like I said.. if you treat the series as science/fantasy, it's good.. and getting better all the time. I rated Season 3, episode 1 with a 9.

"Feels like a 08/15 Science Fiction show but there is no feel or heart of Star Trek in there, for me it looks like that the producers have nothing seen from Star Trek except for the last 2 cinema films...but even these films get closer to Star Trek then this show is. the show is set in the time-line close to the original series, but it feels more like between the original films and TNG.

As bad as the story and the camera work is, i could get over it when there where characters with heart and emotions like in the past Star Trek: Enterprise Show, (it wasn't perfect in a couple of things, but the characters made it nearly perfect for me)but they are all cold and faceless, they all feel like robots, nothing that makes them feel human for me. the only character that has a little bit of chance to get there, maybe in a couple of episodes, is captain lorca i think...

would it be a some kind of a ""new nameless science fiction show"" i maybe would give 5 or 6 points out of 10, but considering the fact that it claims and names itself star trek i could only give 2 points...

so to describe it in one sentence: a lot of cgi with the most stupid story you have seen in a trek show and the most stupid actors u have seen in a trek show (and i don't think this will get better anymore)

my biggest wish is that some day it will come a Trek show that plays in the same time-line but is based on the original series in case of optic and feel, but sadly i know this never will happen to us:(",23 October 2017

Well done on destroying the Star Trek series.",4 October 2017
"Every character is almost always crying for one reason or other. It feels like I am watching a soap opera with characters spewing some scientific jargons. Only thing missing from this soap opera is Back-scheming.

Plot twists are horrible, suspense is predictable but, CGI is good (That's why the 2 Stars). Every punchline is straight out of a Soap Opera.

Tons of life advices in the series (everybody is lifting somebodies morale as they are having existential crisis in their personal life and relationships).

Final Note : Watch it if you are a fan of soap operas for it opened a new genre in that regard, a Sci-Fi Soap opera BS spanning whole Multiverse. Don't ever watch it if you are even remotely a fan of star trek as it will ruin star trek for you and you might develop PTSD for start trek. For those who have never watched star trek, please do not watch this, it's not star trek.

"I'll start by saying I'm a Trekkie through and through. I've bought the merchandise, been to conventions, and I build the model starships when I can. So, when I say I've watched every episode of every Star Trek show ever made, you can believe me.

When I heard there was going to be a new Trek show, I got excited! The first new Star Trek in more than a decade, since the untimely demise of Enterprise. And then more information came out. Slowly, but surely, my excitement waned. Yet, I watched the first episodes eagerly. With every passing minute I became more and more frustrated. Why? Let me tell you.

While the acting is for the most part, excellent and the production is visually impressive, the writing is awful. You cannot create a prequel show without respecting all that has gone before. Your tech is supposed to be inferior, yet Discovery boasts holographic communications, hologramatic user interfaces that the crew uses to access library computers and such and more. Don't even get me started on the ridiculous thing that is the ""spore drive"". I'll just say that while an interesting idea, it was based on flawed science that has since been refuted, completely and utterly.

Enterprise was a good show, but not brilliant. They did things right. They downgraded the available tech seen on the ships. Weapons were underpowered, they didn't have shields, photon torpedoes were brand new. Heck, when she left space dock, she didn't even have phaser cannons. You see my point? Every single time the producers (of which there were 21 for season 2) are challenged to explain the obvious differences, they come up with some non-answer that says absolutely nothing. Then they use weak writing to try and stitch together their already flawed story and marry it with what's accepted as canon in the Star Trek universe.

I'm being generous with my 5 stars, honestly. Mainly for how visually impressive the show is. Sadly, I think my rating is only going to decline further with season 3. Discovery may be Star Trek in name, but it is most definitely NOT Star Trek in nature. This truly could've been a blockbuster had it been done correctly and respectfully.",10 November 2019
I agree with all the previous negative reviews. But I must also note that I think that they are trying so very very hard to appease all of the social justice warriors out there that they have little room to make a decent story. You may have as well named it STAR TREK PC. But like everyone else I also agree that you need to stop going into the past and screwing with continuity. Why do you think that Enterprise did so poorly? It made no sense to go pre TOS and make a series with ships that looked more advanced etc etc. Stop trying to peddle to the social justice warriors and just make a good show and stop screwing up the timeline. I will not subscribe to another month. 6 episodes was more than enough for me to realize that this show has Roddenberry rolling in his grave even worse than Enterprise did.,23 October 2017

"This is not a purist review, some immature guy that wants to ramble about how good old trek was.

I can see parts of the back story and cinematography going somewhere. But even that spark, gone, painted by the rivers of post- modernist, neo-marxist shallow ideology, drowned. Polarizing trek to far-left politics, removing almost all of its core, and on top of that. A nice mask of compassion, going where no man has gone before.

If you have average opinion on this show, it only states your level of ignorance and lack of historical knowledge. This is CULTURE and IDEOLOGY pushing. The ideology that got 10ns of millions people killed the last century. I don't think many people get it, where this rabbit hole ends, one step at a time, one show, one law etc.

There is a mandatory 2k pages book in Russian high-schools now. The ""Gulag Archipelago"" it is called. I recommend you read it.

Just to familiarize yourself how this ""art"", or ""culture"" pushing ends.

Shame to see this kind of stuff, pops on the big screens these days.

I wont even start talking about the Klingons, thats hilarious. Taking their iconic facial expressions out, overshadowing the honor narrative with some ""purity"" poop.

"Thanks for ruining the series. This show is boring, soapbox- grandstanding at its finest. Although there has always been an element of PC culture in Star Trek that exhibited itself in ""humans are all equal"", I feel this series has stretched PC to the breaking point just to see how much push-back the fans will give. For me it seems that the Alinsky Rules are working as the networks work to destroy everything Western Civilization cherishes. ""Star Wars reboot... check... garbage... Star Trek TV show... check! garbage...what else can we screw up? Hey! What about Rocky? Let's make him the first trans woman boxer that beats up a straight-cis-white guy from Iowa!""

Behaviour of what are supposed to be highly trained Starfleet officers (yeah more like petulant 5 year olds) acting completely unlike an office should. No optimistic future view here folks. Just darkness, misery and another desperate attempt to make something akin to TWD or GOT to appeal to filth-minded millenials. And swearing! Absolute joke.

"After watching the first ten episodes of Star Trek: Discovery currently available on Netflix I decided that enough is enough.

Star Trek: Discovery is a lacking, nonintellectual and clumsy attempt at recreating Gene Roddenberry's cult classic. Besides being all that it takes itself way too seriously.

All character dialogue in the series is utterly horrible. Everything every character says seems to be a and clumsy explanation of what's currently happening on screen aimed at the audience. The characters continuously explain the most mundane and normal events of their own universe to each other while Discovering new things they should already be aware of given that they're the best of the best working in top of the line military science vessel. Most of the time the characters Discover their own feelings about an event or anothing character.

All the human characters are hyper emotional, rash caricatures with bursting impulsive compulsions and lacking self control and social skills. The main characters are also highly sexual and for obvious reasons there's a token gay couple in the mix as well. There is no strategic thinking in the series and every big decision is made impulsively and on the spot with no real discussion surrounding it. Most of the time the half-Vulcan female lead character Burnham is somehow deemed the most qualified to make every single decision in the series. And then deemed the most qualified to act those decision out with guns blazing and emotions running wild.

There are some really interesting characters in the mix as well. It's a real shame the lead characters get all the screen time and dialogue, while the alien science officers, witty engineers and cybernetic androids are used only as backdrops with expensive makeup. Some of the characters seem to be based on two or three lines of backstory. ""This is the character with the weird eyes. The character is also steadfast and has emotions."" The most intelligent specialists on the ship rarely get a say in anything and the characters tend to keep every single bit of knowledge to themselves for as long as possible, before revealing it to the other characters only as a plot device in a dramatic way after hours or days of withholding it. Everything even remotely scientific in STD is way less so than even in the original series made back in the 60's. But the original series came out in the 60's so how is that even possible you ask. Well in the 60's they wanted the original Star Trek series to be scientifically at least somewhat accurate so the creators consulted actual scientists on matters of science. In STD the science is a mere backdrop as well and sadly so. With no scientific accuracy or any rational logic the series is just a fantasy drama set on a space ship.

Plot wise STD relies solely on two things: keeping the audience information deprived and then surprising the audience with something unexpected and bold. Repeat every 1-2 episodes. This straightforward action movie script style would probably work better if the audience consisted of pre-teens and elderly people. There is no real big picture in the series either which is a real shame given that the series promised to show the audience a part of the timeline less familiar with some pretty huge events going on in the part universe with the massive war and everything. Instead in a vast colorful and interesting universe the crew of a top of the line science vessel keeps running into the same bad people over and over again while struggling with the same idiotic problems in every episode. Everybody on the ship is a hero and bad guys are bad guys just because. Then the suspense is built and in the next episode you get to see more of exactly the same with little no to progress while all the characters struggling with their basic emotions and sexual needs.

Bonus points for hiring Doug Jones, who surely deserves more dialogue and screen time than this.

To all the other disappointed Star Trek and scifi fans out there: instead of watching this sad piece of modern media go watch The Orville instead. It's better in almost every way while doing almost the same exact thing and watching it is actually fun and enjoyable.",14 January 2018
"Oh my god. It's like they intentionally want to make a terrible show. I can't believe how untalented this writing and production is. It's so sad how cringe it is.

There is literally not a single element that I can think of that is good in this show. Most importantly, this has nothing to do with science fiction. You can clearly tell that there is no one with the faintest idea of science on the writing team. It's insultingly stupid for something bearing the name 'Star Trek'.

There is literally not a single likeable character. All of them are incredibly cringe.

"I think this isn't the worst Star Trek series ever. That distinction goes to Star Trek: Enterprise. It is bad though. What really sucks is that the show has such potential. The effects are great. The characters look cool. It's just absolutely horrendous writing.

As other reviewers have said, when they try to update things they tend to just ruin them. And seemingly this was created by people who had no respect at all for Star Trek, in general. They trample on continuity and Star Trek tradition every chance they get.

Examples of this:

-The opening sequence that no longer shows the ship flying through space, as in every other Star Trek series so far. Instead they show a drawing of the ships design moving over it from different angles. It reminds me of the opening to Black Sails, or West World. It's ok, but it breaks a long established and beloved tradition, for a rip off from other current series. They should have saved the new sequence for the end credits or something. The Orville, which isn't even a Star Trek series, has a more Star Trek opening than this one, and a more Star Trek feel for that matter.

-They changed the appearance of Klingons. I will admit that the new Klingons do look cool. And I especially like how they actually speak Klingon. However, the Klingons from the previous Star Treks, (except the original) had become the perfect Klingons. There was no need to change them. And once again this destroyed continuity between the other series. At least in one of the previous series, they had attempted to explain why Klingons looked different than in the original series. They said something about, this was before the great change.

-The jump drive. This makes for the worst writing I've ever seen. Though the federation has access to this technology, and considers it the key to winning the war, they never install it in any other ship in the federation. WTF? To make matters worse, they have it that this isn't some advanced technology which is incapable of being placed on other ships. No, this is just some spores that any ship could have used, with minor modification. Once again this completely destroys continuity since, why wasn't this used in the other series which were set after this series.

-Continuous story- Once again by trying to copy the current annoying trend of other shows, they have done away with the episodic, self contained type episodes, and replaced that with one long continuous story that takes the whole season to view. I hate this in any series. But, it's once again a trampling on of tradition here, since every other Star Trek was episodic. Sure there was an overall story to each. But one could watch any episode without having to have watched previous ones.



Anyways, those are some of the examples that show how the producers and writers show no respect or love towards Star Trek. Besides all that the show is just no fun at all. There is absolutely no humor, which every other Star Trek had. The characters are all extremely unlikable. The only ones I liked were Michelle Yeoh's character, and the Captain who was then done away with. The ships Politically correct doctor is one of the most unlikable characters I've seen on any show. And, the ditzy rehead engineer or whatever she is is also pretty unlikable. Oh yeh, the tall skinny first officer/captain at times, is also extremely unlikable.

This is the only Star Trek series I quit watching besides Enterprise, which I quit watching on ethical grounds, because they got into this terrorist overarching story, and even said it was okay to torture terrorists. Here I didn't encounter any ethical problems. If anything this show is far to politically correct. Dealing with stupid and annoying politically motivated subplots.

"I think the series is destined to be the worst Star Trek series ever filmed. The reason I think that is because the show is staged as if it's not from The Real Star Trek culture. For example, in the original Star Trek series, each episode tells a story of its own. I mean, the structure of the episodic episode prevails, and in this series, the story is so extended that it bothers people a lot. In order for it to be science fiction and not Star Trek to repeat itself, there will surely be a new fictional technology in every Star Trek series. But I find it hard to understand what it is to travel with mushrooms. This is a ridiculous idea, really had.",30 June 2020

"Everything Star Trek was acceptable for me. Now no more. The first season showed everything. A parallel universe, Klingons conquering the Federation. The Original Star Trek showed this in the few years it was on air. Every episode was an independent adventure. In this show if there is problem, either it is resolved after some episodes or never is.

"I want to like this show. the special effects are fairly good and contrary to other people's views, i don't think the technology is too advanced for the series. The problem is the acting - specifically the actress playing michael burnham. This character supposedly was raised by vulcans but emotes more than the crew put together.

"It surely has its moments, and yes i watched all 3 seasons regardless Saru is excellent and should have more screen time (at least the same ammount as burnham), i loved the gay couple paul and hugh moments (they are so sweet), tilly is cute and fun, i also like detmers personality and her eye implant is cool, the spore drive is a very interesting concept, and some other things make it worthwhile watching this series, altough i always kept my finger on the skip button and i did skip a lot over the 3 seasons (maybe 40%?)

Also, i do not like the design of the discovery ship, altough a fairly new ship it looks so square and outdated, at least compared to so many desgings in the star trek universe.

This series just has too much whining and cringe moments, and way too much of Michael Burnham as she HAS to be in every scene and tied to anything deemed important, feels like she is the only really important person in the show, as without her nothing would work or get done, if at least the character would be half as cool as saru, tilly the gay couple or detmer, but instead she is a lame and boring card board character, heck even linus has more character then burnham?!

They should rename the series Star Trek: Michael Burnham

Also it has too much forced political correctness, which makes everything quite odd.

I'm 3 episodes in and so far not at all impressed. It's trying way too hard. The acting is mediocre and so far so are the stories and scripts. It's kind of lame for something trading on the Star Trek brand. I'll keep watching and will update this if somehow it gets better.,22 June 2020

"The fan base of any SyFy and especially Star Trek is and always will be male. They outnumber the female fan base by huge degree. So why is everything in this show about women and LGQTB? That is the whole cast! I am open minded but this is too much. This STAR TREK is made for a small percentage of women who like SYFY! Just because they need a new fan base, and think the original fan base is extremely loyal. SO they think we will swallow everything they trow at us. As a male watcher I am unable to relate to this show in anyway.

The storyline is a big enigma for me. It does not fit in any of the other shows. And that is hard for me to relate to. They have more different species then TOS, TGN, DS9 and Voyager. And this show is suppose to develop humans race to accept other species!",23 November 2017

Season 1 & 2 was very good. But season 3 is a absolute disaster. After watching the first two seasons my expectations were high. But season three is disappointingly slow and the storytelling is painfully slow.,23 March 2021
"On the plus side, the production quality is very high.

Also, I like that Klingons spoke Klingon to each other. It's absurd to think Klingons would speak English at a ""Klingon convention"".

Speaking of Klingons, the costume quality is very high, the best I've seen.

However, this isn't the first time I've seen Klingons.

I have two issues with their appearance:

1) They don't look like those I've become accustomed to seeing.

2) They're too inhuman. In other series, Klingons (at least Worf) has been in relationships with ""humanish"" characters. While not impossible, it seems unlikely that Discovery Klingons would appeal to humans. Of course, we haven't seen any female Klingons. Maybe they all look like Scarlett Johansson. :)

Maybe it's what's ""inside"" that counts, but these Klingons don't strike me as caring and romantic.

Moving on...

The acting and dialog was somewhat wooden.

The lead actress (playing Michael) has a particularly difficult job.

Spock's failure to express emotion is accepted because he is half Vulcan, and because he is male.

Michael is human, though raised by Vulcans.

Each rare instance of Spock expressing emotion is savored by the fans.

They admire his Vulcan characteristics, but also want hints of compassion and emotional needs.

They often identify with his inability to fully fit in - with either humans or Vulcans.

However, Michael's failure to express emotion may be treated harshly. She's human and female. On the other hand, if she expresses emotion too readily, the significance of her Vulcan upbringing is appreciably lessened.

It took a while for Nimoy to ""get Spock down"". In the first half of Season 1 of TOS, Spock sometimes ""uncharacteristically"" shouts and smiles.

Moving on...

I didn't feel immersed in the story. In fact, I didn't feel like there was much of a story.

I didn't feel like a story was going on, but that actors were acting, and that the writers had shoehorned certain lines in.

When Michael was trapped, protected from vacuum only by a force field, I didn't feel concern for her situation.

Maybe that was partly due to the fact that her character is new to me, and I haven't yet bonded with her. Yet, at times I've ""been scared for"" characters in movies, whom I've never ""seen"" prior to the movie.

I think it's too soon to tell whether this will get better.

I'll continue watching.

Anything labeled ""Star Trek"" would have to be horrific for me not to watch.

"Time travel! Really?? Why not introduce God and the little friggin mermaid too. Star Trek is about science and the consensus is that backward time travel IS NOT POSSIBLE!!!!!

The existence of section 31 means it's not much better than today... its basically today in space.. with worse clothes. Oh man and the characters, why is there a babbling redhead on the bridge that is always super awkward. The cheesy sentimentality - uuuurgh! Pls no more...

"As other reviews state, ""this is not Star Trek"". If you watch this as a completely new science fiction idea for a TV series it still only just about works. Packaged as a Star Trek series it fails miserably. Totally convoluted over complicated plots, far too many characters for the viewer to identify with until you get to episode 13/14 (is it some sort of actors 'job creation' scheme?). A dark, negative vision of our future that Star Trek has always successfully avoided in the past. My only conclusion can be that it has not been written, produced and directed by die hard Star Trek fans but given to people who are only interested in negative science fiction depicting anger, battle, war and 'bloody' gory destruction. Please have a return to single episode stories with the occasional two part story. This mammoth, negative over complicated approach to Star Trek doesn't work for me....at all",7 February 2018
"The character of Michael Burnham is WAY too emotional for someone reared in the logical Vulcan society, even for a human. Virtually every scene finds this character emoting some dispair or mooning like a sad child about her or others circumstances. She is more emotional than had she been reared on Earth. The years of exposure to the Vulcan way of life would surely have made her a bit more staid. I'm streaming this series now and I'm often tempted to turn it off due her character's emotional outbursts. I'm not knocking the actor, just the character.",7 April 2019

"Allow me to write a somewhat different review by indulging in a prediction of what Star Trek: Discovery will be about (so a spoiler alert, which may turn out wrong).

As of writing STD is in its first season, episode three. There is a war with the Klingons going on and a mysterious starfleet ship named discovery has picked about Michael, the female unsung hero in the rank of starfleet commander; and committing mutiny with best intentions. The plot is set some decade before Kirk (OTS). In the third episode have been hints of genetic weaponry and lot's of warmongering by starfleet personnel.

Before start of the series the makers have been quoted that it was going to be about something that has been talked about but never received much attention. Here is what I think it will be about.

The Klingon's bear a boney forehead in all TNG and later series as well as Enterprise. However in OTS they did look quite different; bearing no strongly pronounced forehead.

So I believe this series is about how the Klingon's temporarily lost their foreheads by a genetic attack of the federation.

This is as absurd as it is possible in this series. Think about it.",2 October 2017

"OK folks, this is supposed to take place about ten years for the original series, yet Discovery is equipped with control systems, communication systems (Holographic) and other advanced technology not present in the ST timeline for decades if not centuries ahead, yet in other cases uses the original series communicators? And who in their right mind turned the Klingons into whatever they are supposed to be?

The show itself is not bad, but it does NOT fit into the ST timeline in any way shape of form. I suppose they could claim it is a Section 31 advanced ship design, but that would be almost comical given the technology that Discovery carries.

Bottom line...For me the lack of attention to details and in failing to have the show make senses in the timeline is a deal killer. I can enjoy the show as a stand alone show but there is no way to consider it as a true part of the ST franchises..",17 December 2020
Nothing like the Star Trek you grew up with. This is just a politically correct parody set in the future past of the Kirk universe we love. Now you are probably thinking yeah sounds good I love watching prequels have more advanced tech and alterations to aliens already fleshed out in other series.

"Whisper ...whisper ... cry and whisper, cry and whisper some more. Omg who talks like that? Really? Think about it....do these writers really think people talk like this? I can live with the woke and all the PC stuff, although it times it is a bit much. Star Trek has always been about the social issues of the times and this is what the world is now. But pleeez give me some good acting and some semblance of a story or a direction. They keep referring themselves as a science vessel. Really? I don't see any science here. All I see is a soap opera in outer space. They just jumped over 900 years into the future. Where is their curiosity? Are they not interested in as to what's out there? Instead we get a bunch of cry babies worried about their relationships. And of course it's all about super Michael aging the universe every week! Come on... who writes this stuff? This is a space soap opera. I've been a Trekkie since the first series in the 1960s. Can't watch this anymore.",30 November 2020
"From the beginning I was really looking forward to another edition to the Star Trek franchise but I was thoroughly let down on almost every front in this series. It constantly lacks consistency on multiple fronts if not the script its the characters appearance. I'll take an examples from season 3 for the most noticeable appearance inconsistency, -Tilly is walking with Saru across the rocky plain one moment her hair is tied back atop her head roughly above her ears (if you were to draw a line from one ear to the other over her head) and a few camera cuts later its tied more forward and looks much more disheveled one cut later its back to where it was and looking pristine again, for most this may not be noticeable but its a immersion breaker.

-In another episode from season 3 we have the crew arrive from their wormhole travel running about trying to fix Discovery and all stating ""we don't know when we are"" and then a few minutes later they all seem to know perfectly well when they are and state it with little reasoning why once again an immersion breaker.

The behavior of the characters aside from Saru who seems to be the only character who acts as you would expect someone in such a position tp behave, all the rest behave like a bunch of teenagers working in a fast food chain and all have very witty retorts to one another while getting tasks done in previous installment in the franchise they would've been reprimanded for such behavior by any commanding officer. It almost seems like those that writes the scripts for this show haven't even seen any previous Star Trek installments.

The only thing that has some merits in this show seem to be those in the animation and CG departments but alas you cannot disguise all the faults with this show with fancy CGI, cool effects and stunning sets or locations.

I was really surprised that this show managed to get a third season at all.",20 November 2020

"Star Trek is about integrity in the face of adversity, and showing how even the worst villains have a motivation that you can identify with on some level.

Every last character is repulsive, and I honestly wish they'd all die.

Since I am old and remember the first star trek it seem to me it was always on the bad side of reviews. It has to grow on you and then people normally compare old with new.

Money money money rules all and I pay enough now so if they want me to pay more for the latest star Trek it is not going to happen. Stream away but you need to produce something a whole lot better.

"I watched the first 5 or 6 shows then dropped it. The effects are better than ever but as a compelling ""Star Trek"" iteration it's almost unwatchable. It's obvious the writers have only a passing interest in big picture science fiction and exploration themes.

The narrative focus here is on small scale bickering and interpersonal conflict between a largely whining, arrogant, unlikeable cast of characters. The motivations and actions of the characters make no sense and the main protagonist is presented as this super smart, hyper competent officer who keeps behaving like a self centered, petulant, and whose decisions seem unmoored from any notion of logic or common sense. Her crew mates are little better. .

On prior Treks the emphasis seem mainly (but not solely) directed outward to affirmative themes and positive outlook big picture problem solving and universal questions. Here there is little of that. Here the *real* narrative focus is on everyone's personal angst and fighting with other people, except it's on a space ship discovering strange new ways to spread money thinly on lots of lousy visual effects.

They expect people to pay upfront to watch it?!",29 May 2018
"The vision of Star Trek is to imagine what would happen if we apply our logic, knowledge and emotions at a galactic scale. The beauty lies in the character's struggle to balance out the logic and emotions in order to obtain the best outcome possible out of every situation. Beside the techie stuff, which makes ST a true sci-fi.

Well this... thing... is nothing like that. I would've still watch it if at least it would be well written but it's not even that. I barely made it though 6 episodes and boy I feel like Netflix should give me my money back for this month.

Massive plot holes which completely break immersion. The characters make the most ridiculous decisions just for the sake of creating tense situations, past situations generate exactly the opposite outcome of what you would logically assume, important character building sections are fast forwarded while boring and convoluted sections that add nothing drag on.

Again, I would've look past the fact that the series has almost nothing to do with Star Trek, since I'm starving for a sci-fi, but only if this series was any good... and damn sure it isn't...",19 February 2019
"All these bad reviews from so-called fans... tut-tut.

So here's a review from a very much traditional Trek fan. What do I mean by that? I absolutely did not like the JJ Trek films. The writing was abhorrent, the action meaningless and ultimately did nothing for the franchise except bring in a new generation of fans who could not appreciate what Star Trek meant or really was. I cringed when my friend, who has never seen any of the Trek series, said he loved the new films, yet still refuses to watch The Next Generation or TOS.

How about the Enterprise series? I was not mad on it, but I appreciated it all the same. It had more bad episodes than good ones, and ultimately not a series I'd re-watch.

Now, here comes Star Trek Discovery... I was very skeptical when I first saw the trailer, and I must say the trailer did the show zero favors. It certainly ranks high on my list as the most badly edited trailers to come out this year, and probably cost the show more fans than it had earned. Sadly.

So, I got to watch the pilot episode, and second a few days ago. It started somewhat, shaky. I was not won over by Michelle Yeoh's performance, not at first anyhow, until I started to get a feel for the character. However, Sonequa Martin-Green performance as her Number 1 convinced me this was going to be good, and the chemistry that the two shared was interesting. I was intrigued, and by the time the first episode was over, I was hooked. I wanted to know where this was going! I have never been this excited for a series since, since... I don't know. Enterprise certainly never got me this excited! Star Trek Discovery is picking up some positive reviews from mainstream outlets, but negative reviews from 'some' fans... Everyone I know who is a traditional fan loves this, so why the hate...

Is it because of the lead female roles? Couldn't be cause Jason Isaacs is due to take the lead. Yet then I read some reviews and comments suggesting that the show is politically correct by casting the likes of Martin-Green and Michelle Yeoh... Seriously? A minority is having a go because of the casting of an Asian and a black woman... Seriously.

As someone who is as anti-PC as they come, and absolutely hate politically correctness, I don't feel it with this. I don't feel it was 'deliberate' unlike the impression I got with some other films recently. And even if you think that, as a fan, if you are a fan, you should look past that and see the quality of the writing, the characters being put forward here, and the bold new direction which is taking place.

Some reviews are taking snipes at the CGI, the makeup and the action sets. ""Star Trek is not about action! It's about telling stories, discovery through those stories, not about fancy laser shows!"" - I agree. But this isn't JJ Abrams material. And lets be fair, very little action takes place until near the end of Episode 2. So I did not feel like I was watching action non-stop, and if any fan can actually sit down and appreciate story that is unfolding, they'll see this too, rather than being blinded by the so-called political correctness that some people are seeing here. And when the action did finally start, it still managed to tell a meaningful story, unlike those you might witness in any of the new Star Trek films...

Other reviewers are angry at the klingon makeup, how its drastically different. This could easily be explained as the onset of the augment virus (look it up if you don't know what it is) or, it could simply be looked at as another take on early klingons, which lets be fair; this wouldn't be the first time that a odd-looking klingon hit our screens. I must say though I love the new makeup designs, and it is by far my favorite so far - they look more culturally distinct than just having a beard and a ridged forehead...

However, I gotta criticize the seemingly excruciating slow dialogue that they engage in; is this done deliberately so that the subtitles, which are already blistering past the screen, have time to catch-up? Star Trek Discovery is certainly going into a bold new direction. I'm excited, but I do have concerns, valid concerns. I'm looking forward to Jason Isaac's role as the captain of the Discovery, but, I'm worried about predictability... I'm familiar with Isaac and the general roles he tends to play. I'm worried he will end up just as an antagonistic klingon hating captain for Green to rub-off against, who will probably see the racism in her new captain and have it as a reminder of her own hatred. Classic character development u-turn. I sincerely hope the writers are smarter than that, but I'm optimistic and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.

Any true trek fan should. Any true trek fan should look past the apparent so-called PC connotations. Any true trek fan should look past the fancy CGI and accept that this is the modern age we live in and we will not be going back to the The Original Series or the Star Trek Next Generations 'look and feel' of the traditional sets.

Is this a series for a new generation? Yes, it is.

But also one for the old, and one that I feel, captures the feel and spirit of Star Trek while taking it into a new bold direction.",1 October 2017
"I've only seen the first episode and snippets of following episodes on YouTube to go by.

This review of mine has more to do with the Star Trek technology that existed ten years before Captain Kirk and the Enterprise.

It's a risky business for any director and producer to go back in time and re-envision the technology of an old television series, or more challenging, how the technology should look just one decade earlier. To give you an example, Star Trek Enterprise re-envisioned the Romulan spaceships and ended up showing a far more advanced Romulan Bird-of-Prey than the one depicted one hundred years into the future on TOS, ""Balance of Terror"". More, there was an anachronism, depicting the earlier birds-of-prey as warp capable while the TOS bird-of-prey functioned on impulse only. There was a solution to that conundrum in the approved, Star Trek paperback books of the early 90s. The Romulans possessed advanced nuclear fusion spaceships that could travel at low warps speeds, the best being about 3.1 warp at the height of the Earth-Romulan war. But that explanation was not exploited. The first director of Star Trek Discovery was behind the design of the 'Discovery'. I believe he over-reached in trying to envision an earlier Starfleet, ship-of-the-line spaceship. In the history of military ships, planes, and tanks, the most common path is to design and produce successively better models or marks, each successive one strongly resembling the previous. Following this path of human technological design custom, the DISCOVERY actually should have resembled the ENTERPRISE, if not 100% then mostly. The Discovery shows exterior design elements that insinuate it is an advanced model decades ahead of the Enterprise. I believe the first director (he later left the project) feared boring Star Trek fans with an Enterprise duplicate. He need not have feared that. Since the Discovery was only ten years before the Enterprise, the spaceship should have been of slightly simpler, geometric design. One illustration shows an early Federation starship that resembles a smaller version of the advanced Excelsior class of Captain Kirk's time when he had been promoted to admiral. That smaller version could have been used. But again, this is my opinion. Yet I think most Star Trek fans might have been pleased. Not all is disappointment. Like most Star Trek fans, I was delighted by the early version of the original Star Trek phaser. This one I say the director got spot on. My belief is that this early mark is really an 'interim' model as it appears to have been fairly quickly superseded by the version that showed a dilithium crystal emitter tip that fans are used to seeing. If I want to get picky on anything, it would be the pistol grip, which appears too elaborate. The reason is the pistol grip is actually the detachable, disposable power source, an excellent design idea. Therefore it was simple in design and had smooth sides in the original Star Trek. Again, I think the director just felt he had to change something more for change's sake. I am delighted that the detachable, dual phaser design had been kept. Few know this unless you're a dedicated Trekker fan. The little black box phasers sometimes carried by Kirk, Spock, and a few other landing party members were actually meant to be mounted on a phaser frame and used as the pistol grip unit. The pistol grip frame could still fire independently if the black box phaser was removed from the top. But this was never shown in any Star Trek series. The advantage to detaching the black box phaser was that it was concealable and less obvious when landing party members did not want to be seen as heavily armed for diplomatic or social reasons. The later improved original Star Trek phaser replaced the triple aperture emitter of the interim design with the needle-like dilithium crystal emitter. This occurred when newer supplies of dilithium crystals had been discovered on other planets and asteroids. Earth possessed no indigenous supplies of dilithium crystals except for the rare ones found inside meteorites crashed on Earth. The dilithium emitter was far more effective and efficient at focusing and controlling the phased energy output of the phaser. There was no need for three, separate, different-sized, phaser emitter holes at the firing end of the phaser. The interim phaser model is a definite winner. I think the director, nonetheless, could have saved time and money by simply taking the original Star Trek phaser and replacing the firing nozzle cup with one that had the three, emitter firing holes. That would have been extremely realistic in showing the earlier interim version just before the advent of the dilithium crystal 'needle tip' emitter.

What about the current Discovery Starfleet spaceship? Looks like fans are stuck with it. The only thing I can think of is if the Discovery starship is too heavily damaged in battle and the crew gets a replacement starship of the design I mentioned, or one that is nearly identical to the future Enterprise.",24 September 2017

"Discovery is a Trek show in name only. The show is dark and depressing, takes itself far too seriously. The rare moments of humour are so rare they feel akin to giving a starving man a single biscuit when what we need is a hearty meal.

There is far too much focus on Michael Burnham alone, Star Trek is about having an ensemble cast, with character development being shared equally among crew members, some episodes focusing directly on certain lower ranked crew members and the more established crew taking a back seat.

You can only change the recipe of something so much before it stops being that thing and that's what has happened with Discovery, they've gone so far in a different direction that they've removed almost everything that made Star Trek Science Fiction stand out from the rest in the first place. As a stand alone show, it's actually pretty good, but as a Star Trek show, it completely misses the point.",5 February 2019

"I so much wanted to like this. I really did. So, why is a woman (or is the actor a transgender?) character assigned a male name? Did her parents not notice she was female. Vulcan heads too high in the clouds to not notice either. Pretty dumb really. Let's take Sylvester Stallone and give him a reall tough guy roll and then call his character Susan.... Ah well. The character was supposed to have been raised by Vulcans, might it have been more interesting if she had an honorary Vulcan name (T'Gladys T'Petunia T'Hermione). Main actor is very wooden, pretty much emotionless. It looks superficially good. Uniforms a tad naff. Ship design is dreadful. No wonder this was never used, somebody obviously missed the trash can on that one. Oh and the magic mushroom drive???? Huh what! eh! A ship with a fungal infection ... oh dear. I cannot watch anymore, never thought I'd say that about Trek... Sorry Trek ... what a sad ending to a great franchise.",11 January 2020

The story of the third season is more like ""what can we do to keep the viewers interested?"". There should be a clear story arc like in the first season and stick to it. Otherwise it's just a waste of time. I am a Star-Trek fun, but unfortunately watching Star Trek is no longer fun.",29 December 2020

"I am a big fan of the Star Trek franchise. I watched the first episode last night. The pilot has many things I don't like. The characters are not being developed very well. The dialog is poor. The plot is all over the place. I believe they have good actors but the writing is not solid. I want to give the show a chance because many of the other spin offs from the original series had similar problems in their pilot episodes. However, I didn't have to pay extra $ 6.00/ month to watch the series. I have watched CBS all access and is filled with commercials. Nothing different from my cable CBS station. They don't offer many original series or movies. I already pay an arm and a leg for cable. All the shows I watch on cable are available on Demand in the Xfinity app for my android tablet so I can watch anywhere. I pay for Netflix but they offer movies, my favorite old series and their many original series are amazing. I have amazon prime and I have a similar experience plus I get all the services on amazon.com and of course no commercials at all. Sorry CBS but your CBS all access is not that good for me to pay extra. I want to watch Discovery but it is not worth the money.",25 September 2017
"Gene Roddenberry's STAR TREK was inspiring and full of optimism for the future.

The color pallet was bright, and the Starship Design (interiors & exterior) was futuristically uncluttered & utilitarian, adding to that sense of optimism.

Visually, this new insult to the franchise, is a dark, depressing, over-'designed' mess. And the show's name, in abbreviation, is STD,... what does that remind you of? And, if this time period is 10 years before 'The Original Series' (TOS), why is there nothing that visually shows us that, beyond a couple of hand props? The Discovery, itself, is a design throwback, feeling like it should exist 40 years before TOS, not 10.

Hanging the catch phrase: STAR TREK on a show, just to bring in a larger audience, is just wrong. Title it: ""STARSHIP: DISCOVERY"", and I would watch it, because it doesn't feel like the 'Trek' which has lasted for 50+ years.

What I've 'discovered' is, that I am not 'inspired' to pay for the 'privilege' of watching this on PPV.",25 September 2017
"With just a little tweaking of the script, this series could easily be a tasteless satire of the Star Trek concept and a not funny caricature of the real thing. But, unfortunately, ""ST:Discovery"" takes itself seriously, so it ends up being merely garbage and boring in the extreme.

"I just began watching the first episode of season three and I have totally changed my mind about the the program. One of the things is that they have not listened to is the shaky camera I watched about five minutes of it it was making me so seasick and music was playing over the dialogue making it impossible to understand so clearly this is not going to change and I am not going to watch anymore I reduce my rating to a four.

Not a bad effort story-wise, but... 1. Technical stuff: Whispering actors. What's with the breathy voices? Numerous actors are doing it now. It makes them hard to understand, and as for the realism excuse. In the first season they had to over accentuate the mike to make Sonequa Green audible because any conversation she had was muffled due to her (or her director's) insistence on whispering her lines. Second season was an improvement in clarity, but now she and Mary Wiseman talk so fast you can't keep up with them. Try to take note of a normal conversation... people don't whisper at each other! (Although some do speak fast) Seasick camera for no apparent reason. Do these guys lay awake at night trying to think of ways to piss off the audience? ""Oh it's for realism, that's why they use the documentary type of film making!"" I say Bull feathers! It's totally annoying! Then there are the Lens Flares and smoky backgrounds... on an earth ship? I thought there was no smoking on a Federation Starship! What next, are they going to use distorted colour or darken it to the point of being unwatchable? (Favourite tricks of past discarded methods of film making.) The overall look is the biggest flaw in my opinion.

2. Girl Power push. I have no problem with equality but a 110 lb. Girl beating the crap out of a 7 foot Klingon? And to top that off, they send two women alone to deal with angry aggressive Klingon renegades. Imagine Kirk sending Uhura, and Rand on that mission. They do this frequently and the straight males all seem a little suppressed, even the captain. He seems to have little authority and is somewhat undecided, thank goodness he has a ""Michael"" to keep him in line and help him with making decisions. Even his boss is female, not to mention all the main villains. (At least their sidekicks are male.) I suggest they use the characters more realistically.

3. For the story: The first season was a bit shaky what with their technology being 10 years before Kirk & the Enterprise which I have gotten used to, and it improves with certain story references in the second season. I like what they did there. The later stories are why I upped it to a 6. I love special effects and they do them well. The artwork is phenomenal. I have no idea what happens to the stars when they are at warp though, they just have white lines. The continuity I like as they have a continuing story with complete stories in many of the episodes. They have adhered to the Federation principles but only at the behest of the whispering wannabe Vulcan (Michael). Admirals have to be reminded not to do naughty things like commit genocide. But that admiral was a woman so she must have been having a bad day. A male admiral would have taken away the car keys for the weekend! LOL Summary: The bad audio cost a point, the seasick camera and the unnecessary lens flares cost 2 points, which would have merited an 8 at least if not for the bad production. More people should complain about these things. They don't contribute to the story. I poke fun at some story lines, but still liked them as they resolved well. Overall, I am on the fence but am leaning toward the like side.

Keep trying and listen to your audience. The stories are good. I haven't given up on you yet!

Season 4: Well I have finally given up on Star Trek discovery. It is unfortunate that Sonequa Martin Green spoils the series for me. My wife and I are older I am nearly 70 and I cannot understand most of what she says without subtitles and she still insists, in the fourth season, to continue to whisper her lines. I find it extremely and I say that with exclamation mark's, annoying and difficult to understand and I still haven't found anything in her character that I find interesting enough to invest myself into the character. There are a couple of other characters on the show that I like but unfortunately if you were to take Shaniqua Martin Green out of that series it would not bother me in the least I really think anything that replaces her would be better than what she is . I can't believe that she actually got a nomination for an award in her acting in this series. As far as I am concerned she butchers it. I reached the end of my rope I am not going to watch it anymore and I'm not going to review it anymore because it is simply a waste of my time which I don't have much left

"This attempt to cash in on the Star Trek universe falls woefully short for the dedicated and long term trekkers. Having watched the original series during its original broadcast, I can say I have seen it all. In fact every episode of every iteration of Star Trek. This version was difficult to watch. The Klingon's rubber masks are as grotesque as is their Klingon. More like Gorillas than humanoids, they are a terrible joke and shockingly inconsistent with either the original or the TNG modification. They supposedly have cloaking devices when in the original series they acquired them from Romulans after the first season. The force field wrapping that saves the first officer in the bridge is not even in Voyager. Furthermore, the politically correct cast of women at the top and visible aliens is clearly contrived. The long distance communication between Sarek and the first officer is ludicrous. The Captain is completely naive to not even have her ship in alert status when encountering an unknown ship. Painful is my final verdict.",25 September 2017

"Since I was a child I've been a hige Star Trek fan. I loved their take on ordinary day emotional wrestling mixed with science fiction and a deep general storyline. But also: There was no main character! It was one big family, each with their own storyline, noone trying to be the 'best' character. It was the mix that made it special I see that Season 2 is trying to go down that road.. a bit! Please Star Trek, get rid of these wanna-be takes on 'emotions vs ratio' battles from Michael Burnham. Why a main character? I don't want to see a hero! IF I would, I would watch Star Wars or any other cheap ass sci-fi ripffos. In addition to that the acting is just terribly unconvincing. I love captain Pike, I love Saroo and the whole bunch. But don't approach them through Michael Birnhams eyes, whose character is just not interesting! the message itself just doesn't grab me a bit.

"It is funny how you can guess the time any movie was made not only by the effects it used, but by it's themes and general atmosphere. The 60s were crushing down established order and tabooes, were full of optimism and camaradarie. The 70s were fascinated with yet another leap of the technology and it's effects on the future. The 80s focused again on men, our self-optimizing and relationships. The 90s savoured depression and the realization that no self-optimizing brings change, unless we delved to the bottom of our emotions. The 21st century... no idea. As many people here pointed out, Discovery has little to do with Star Trek. A few polished, self-optimized individuals who are at constant WAR with someone, somewhere. And they called the ship ""Discovery"". Gone are the high ideals, gone is the camaraderie, gone is the scientific, yet with high regard to EVERY LIFE urge to explore. We are faced with constant darkness and war, evaded by the 2-3 gleamingly polished individuals in the big chairs. The rest of the team is not even properly introduced, not to mention integrated in the plot. Their highest function is pushing buttons... I see Discovery as a mirror of what our society has become. I see it being made from people who grew up alone for people who grew up alone. Who believe that the world out there is a scary, dark place, in which the highest pleasure you derive from society must be how efficient you act in front of everyone and how glamouros you look. I gave 3 stars for the glourious special effects, though and for the good acting of some. Everything else is sad.",19 October 2020

"...but then bad decisions were made! It's such a shame, as I am a huge star trek fan, but unlike many, I am ok with the idea of a reboot in general. Not this time, though. To bring it to the point: this series looks awesome. Visually it is just top notch, directing is really good, too. BUT a good series shoul be carried by its stories and not by its looks. Those should only support the series, help it visualize the plot and let the viewers feel the excitement they deserve. It is like dressing up a beautiful woman in an expensive dress. She has to be beautiful without the dress, too, but it is she who is the star, not what she's wearing. Now, what we got here is hideous woman in a ridiculously expensive dress. That is, what star trek discovery has become. Baaaad bad scripts, with people writing those, who are either just plain stupid or believe, that the viewers are. That could work out, if your target audience is not a star trek fan of the TNG universe. But oh no... I think this just might be the problem! The makers of this series are dumping the old fans! They just wanted somebody younger, somone that is hotter. Not too deep, more exiting. This feels more like a rebound, than a reboot!

"Star Trek Discovery. This is the version of the Star Trek franchise. I've watched the first two seasons and am familiar with the Star Trek franchise. This is a CBS attempt at streaming. The first season starts off less as episodic and more of a series with a one long story arc involving war against the Klingons. The second season as an overall story arc, but has a few episodic flashes of genius. When this new series uses the old characters and does great. When this new series introduces new characters, it does not so great. The main protagonists, Michael Burnham, is featured throughout the two seasons and is the main focus. Thus, the series succeeds or fails on this character. The character once again, like previous main protagonists, breaks Federation rules so the ends justify the means, but those characters were likeable in many ways. However, the Michael Burnham character is not likeable and is basically irritating. The problem seems to be that when the writers and directors tried new characters and news story lines, they start to contradict the Star Trek canon. And not only that many of the characters are not likable or enjoyable. There are exceptions. For instance, Sylvia Tilly played by Mary Weisman is a character in the vein of the old Star Trek series and movies. Saru played by Doug Jones is an excellent example of how to develop a Star Trek character. When Captain Pike and Spock are brought in, a spark returns, because the new writers have something to work from. Star Trek Discovery suffers most though from inconsistencies and a Star Trek canon. That's not just ignoring the high-tech differences of communication and spacesuits and engineering it's also ignoring facts like.... Spock doesn't have a sister.

"I love the make up and the effects, however it took me a while to get used to the way is filmed ( especially on the bridge or small spaces ). Nice idea with the spore drive but it lost its charm, no more significant messages in the action, poor lines - seriously, needs more effort. No inspiration. At times, I believe it will become a drama... Previous series I watched it catched my interest, Discovery is sometimes blant - the characters, the flow of the story . :(",2 March 2019
"So, right from the start it gets a 10 because it's Trek, and that score is really for the first 2 seasons. Bad, I know, but I'm a Trekkie. The first 2 seasons were good. Different for Trek, not quite the Trek norm, but enjoyable and good fun. They added to the lore of the universe. I thought at the beginning of season 3 that Discovery was going back to Trek roots and be something special. It was excellent for 2 episodes. Then it deteriorated into a load of politically correct codswallop. It really pains me to say it but the rest of the season was, erm, cow poo! I'm all for sexual equality, racial equality, gender equality, etc, it's about time for a lot of it, but I don't want it ramming down my throat every single second of every single episode. I do believe there wasn't one white, heterosexual male as a main character. How does that represent society? We theoretically do still need to be around for life to continue! And it's so 'feely, feely' now. Burnham's main acting direction must have been 'stare up at who you are talking to intently and wide eyed, and then whisper earnestly'. Argh! Barf! And let's face it, she'd have long been fired. She's rubbish at her job and undermines all her superior officers. Yes, I know it's not real, but at least keep it credible like we are used to with Trek. Rant over. If there's a season 4 I will watch it. Of course I will, it's Trek. But do please fire the writers, be less PC, try harder and do better.",9 January 2021
"..where this Star Trek was never made. The story is just non-existent, the characters are shallow and nobody could care less for them while they run around. Whoever wrote the screenplay has an attention span of single scene, maybe blinded by all the ridiculous flare and mindless explosions. Even Vulcans would not produce this, while it would probably suit them that the series have no emotion, it also has no logic. It just blows in each and every dimension and each and every alternate timeline.",24 May 2019
It is ok at best! I've watched ALL Star Treks from the time of the first episode of the original with Captain Kirk. Repeatedly watched all the different Star Trek series. This one is supposed to be set 10 years before Kirk! WTH are you people thinking lol. The technology in this is far ahead of all other series. What a complete let down. You have lost all credibility as far as I'm concerned.,27 April 2021
I have been a fan of Gene epic since I have been on the planet. I help to address our social wows while being a reflection of what humanity could be. I absolutely adored season one. I thought it gave the franchise a shot in the are with a new store line and a new cast I fell in love with. Season 2 was a sappy unimaginable series of dribbling and crying. The concept was perfect but the emotional dialogue was a great disappointment. For the writing to be this bad you would have to try extremely hard to kill this cannon of the Star Trek universe. It became a really bad soap opera instead of the hip new series we expected it to be.,30 December 2019
"This is feeling more and more like The Michael Burnham Worship Hour and less like Star Trek. In the whole of the Federation, is she the only person who can solve mystery and conflict? Can she not speak above a whisper? Can we move forward with less whispering and crying? Please diversify the storyline and allow other characters to shine. Many would love to love this show, but it will need to actually BE Star Trek before that happens.",27 November 2020

"I rarely write reviews, but now I need to let off some steam I guess... I can't remember ever stop watching a Sci-Fi show ever in my life. Some were not so good, some were superb, but I always finished them. And of course, the good ones, those I finished several times :-) But this show changed it all. I endured it for a long time, until it was unbearable anymore. But trust me, I tried, episode after episode, but I had to give up. And this is something which makes me sad and angry at the same time. I thought I was an unconditional Sci-Fi lover, no matter what, but I guess there are limits to everything. And for just a random show, I wouldn't case so much, but this is Star Trek, and they shouldn't kill a franchise like this. A brilliant legacy like Star Trek should have gate keepers to maintain the quality. I gave it two stars instead of one, just because it is Sci-Fi, and the special effects are great, but the story line, the acting and the character development are sub-zero.",3 December 2020
They have ruined Star Trek. The show spews nothing but far leftist agenda garbage.

"I've tried to enjoy this since it came out but I've given up and removed it from my pvr. Almost most every character is completely unlikable, even Tilly has become annoying instead of endearing . Burnham's character is particularly unlikable, smug, always right, emotionally spastic. and poorly acted imho. The wonder of space is completely absent from this dreck. Really, really disappointing",30 October 2020
How Saru could happen? What terrible conditions led to creation of such an ugly specious? Seems like he got burned or took sulfuric acid bath in the childhood. I can't sleep normal after saw him. Not subtle. I'm hoping by 2230 genetic cosmetology will be able to fix any imperfections. Everything else is excellent. Amazing VFX.,3 October 2017
"No spoiler other than too much of nothing or 50 things to tell about later. I feel it catered to JJ Abrams Star Trek more than what 50 years of Star Trek has given us. I feel divided. One thing Star Trek gave me was how I be an open thinker and not judge a book by its cover. I have seen the cover of Discovery and think hmmmmm, now what. I give it a 5. It made me think about what lesson should I be learning here?, how does this fit into the time-line?, and where is this going?. I will still watch but may not rush to see it. I will re-watch and try again, like shampoo. I feel bad for saying The Orville feels more like Star Trek to me then this does, but it's true.

Update: After watching the last couple of episode it has gotten back more to a star trek feel but still feels like it should be in kelvin timeline with amount of newer tech. Post E04 review is still feelings like walking on not stable ground and missing some of the Star Trek roots. I will see where it goes and will update again near end of season 1.",25 September 2017
"This is a terrible attempt at a reboot, it is nothing to do with star trek. They just mash it all up and throw it at the wall to see if it will stick.

I do hope it is cancelled soon because it's ruining an iconic franchise by rewriting everything in a really bad and ugly way. I don't think they have a single Trekkie working there, and it shows.

This will no doubt appeal to MCU fans, but I don't think any of them will shed a tear when it's cancelled, and yet they are being so disrespectful to the legacy, the past actors, producers, directors and writers by tossing them out of the nearest airlock.

Discovery really is the enemy of Star Trek. Having been not entirely satisfied with their killing spree, Picard is next up for the reboot treatment (changing things for the sake of change to be edgy and charismatic).

No thank you, anything Kurtzman and Orci touch ends up pissing off most of a given fandom at the expense of failing outright to bring in any new viewers.

Why would Star Trek want these kinds of hacks to do more damage than they have already done.

I will never, ever support CBS again, and that's a fact.",22 August 2018

"I signed up just to write this review. The first three seasons were entertaining, not quite Star Trek but had plot similarities. Season four has turned into teen drama in a sci fi setting. Lower your expectations below a Star Trek standard and you might enjoy it. Be warned it is frustratingly slow, in every episode a character, who seems to have had a lobotomy, will blankly explain their traumatic past.",16 July 2022
"Discovery leaves Star Trek fans with a huge disconnect in the Star Trek universe, in that the spore technology isn't in any of the other Star Treks. This would be fine, except this is a prequel. Then the writers use this great new technology to fight a war with the boring Klingons. What a missed opportunity! Instead of a prequel, think how awesome this Discovery with a spore drive would be in fighting the Borg or Species 8472. But no. The writers took us back in time to an old adversary that isn't half as interesting & gave us with an interesting new technology that doesn't fit in the Star Trek universe. :-(",15 November 2019
"Discovery doesn't know what it wants to be, seemingly because it's making every attempt to distance itself from the source material whilst paradoxically trying to associate itself with it.

If you're easily distracted from uninteresting plots and characters by 90% of the budget having been put in sets and visual effects, you'll probably like it, but there isn't much depth to it and the characters are tolerable at best, but at worst you'll get irritated by stupid decisions and an overwhelming urge to make Michael Burnham an action hero. I half expect her to rip off her uniform to find a big letter ""S"" and a red cape, to fly in and save the day, which she does every 10-15 minutes.

If you want to play a good drinking game, have a shot whenever Michael Burnham saves the day, resolves a situation no one else can, lectures someone, or otherwise do things with the other mere mortals die for attempting. It gets very annoying once you notice it.

Discovery lacks any of the hallmarks of good Star Trek, or good science fiction for that matter. Aside from the fact they are on a space ship it could be set in any of the Marvel films. It's kinda like a live action video game, but where your avatar has a mind of it's own and keeps reminding you that you're too stupid to play.

I would guess that none of the writers are fans of Star Trek, or have any interest in science, philosophy or futurism. It seems pretty clear that it's being written by committee who decide on a bunch of action sequences to spend most of the budget, and then try to fit a plot around the rest where every shot has to use over the top production techniques to distract from mind numbing dialogue.

I've no idea why they decided to do this to Star Trek, which has endured for decades for all of the reasons this isn't Trek. I don't imagine anyone who worked on previous Trek shows would have anything positive to say about it aside from those who worked in post production, but a show can't and won't survive on that alone.",18 January 2019
"I will state from the begining that I will watch the show till the end as I am a star ttek fan (especially tng). Review is after 5 episodes.

My english is not native. Excuse any error in writing.

My review will not be very long. I will only point some succint impressions.

The general atmosphere is lacking. There is no real sense of the federation being at war. There are lots of signs for this, like talking about it, preping for it and so on, but the general sense to me is that they are rather simulating the war. Like they (the whole fleet) would like to con Michael into believing she actually started a conflict. Weird...

There is no real sense that Stamets really is on some great tech discovery. You see him secretive, he doesn't speak about the project and all of the sudden, boom, a technology that rivals steam motor or internet comes into play just as normal as it is when I fuel my car. Weird... Of course, there are refferences to other ships doing research on the topic, even one ship is obliterated by some event related to the research (inconsistently explained) and after all an admiral sais main fleet objective is to find the being responsible for the new tech to really work, but all in all the whole idea is naive, bad explained and unbelievebly implemented. Really contra-sci and anti-fi if you get my point.

The same gender relation is simply put ""politically corect"". Out of star trek context, unnecessary and too obviously presented. I am a liberal in my beliefs and I always understanded the need to be tolerant. But really? This is the first and main relation in the show? Weird... Oh no, the first relation was a different gender relation beetwen two klingons. Still weird...

Lorca is the worst captain ever in series. Unbond with the crew, self-sufficient and arrogant. All are arguments that in the spirit of true star trek, would have dismissed him to became ever a captain.

On the deck their is no other lively presence except Lorca and Saru. The rest rather seem to be cadets. Though are presented as important crew members.

The whole presentation (even effects and scenography) looks like a teen series. The depth of characters is rather ecplained but not felt. Character relations are shallow and unconsistent. Not even one character is really likeable. Or dislikeable. They are all linear characters developed really inconsistent. The star trek feeling is just mimic. Whatch the even worse after trek show and see they (writers and actors) don't even understand the lore. They know it, they don't believe in it. They need to explain their thoughts, the scrips and acting isn't enough. Lame...

The main story can be interesting. There are even some good ideas. This make me follow the show. I watch it also because my wife likes it (finaly discovered star trek) and I enjoy sharing the experience with her.

Hope it gets better. Not really belive it will.",15 December 2019
"Micheal is ready to cry any time. What the hell is that? Give me break. Constantly weeping. And this Red Angel arc....Section 31? Nothing even remotely similar in any other ST series. Bad idea. Seems more and more everything revolves around Micheal. Bad idea. I have stated before that this should not have been called ST. But I enjoyed the first season. This second season is proving very difficult to watch. I am NOT enjoying it at all. It is all to do with the story line. Get a new writing team. Visually, Discovery is nice. Cast is generally fine. Just too much emphasis on minorities and other such people. Not that I have anything against them...just takes ""utopian"" to levels I just don't believe anymore. It is like 90% of the population is OCD and are genius level in things they have absolutely no previous experience in. And I have no problem with the Spock, but changing his whole childhood/back story....not impressed. Discovery started ok, but has taken a turn for the worst.

Oh (edited later). The chracters in the show are mostly good, but the casting sucks. Many of the people they have chosen just don't 'sell it' to me. Some of them gibe me the heeby jeebies.

"Star Trek: Discovery breaks with the poster-boyish-style of the former series. We always saw the nice ships and commanders - and those encounters that could be solved with peace. ST:Discovery shows the other side of war - those troupes who have to fight, those who always died in the background of the old series (for example during the wars in Deep Space 9).

A lot of hardcore fans dislike the series for this new approach, arguing that Star Fleet always used to be pacifistic. That's partly true - e.g. in Voyager we have seen that some situations require the captain to disobey Star Fleet directives.

Even though Micheal Burnham is the protagonist, it becomes more and more clear that her talents enable discovery, but the overall progress of the series is defined by Discovery's captain, Lorca a Military hardliner. Lorca is the product of guild, sacrifice and torture. He shows us another side of human nature which Kirk, Picard and co kept hidden. Lorca is vengeful, driven, efficient and fueled by his past, he wants to win and is willing to take great risks for it.

Conclusion: ST:Discovery shows us another side of war. One that's always there, but has often been neglected in the Star Trek franchise for the sake of spreading positivity. Star Trek however has already established the concept of striving for peaceful coexistence in the past series. Discovery adds a more pragmatic approach: There's 2 sides to a coin and sometimes you're forced to act.

Star Trek Discovery doesn't contradict the franchise, it expands it.",21 November 2017
"Star Trek Discovery has been a breath of fresh air since the likes of Star Trek Enterprise. While its fast pacing and zooming along plotlines can sometimes reach JJ Abrams levels of absurdity, the show always reels it back a little before going over that line.

I've enjoyed Discovery for its bold, modern and twist on the Star Trek genre. Season 1 was fantastic, with a great twist even if the ending left much to be desired, the stories that it told getting to that ending was worth the journey.

Season 2 however, has unfortunately been a disappointment. It isn't bad by a wide margin, it has some good moments. Anson Mount is fantastic as Christopher Pike. Just like how William Shatner was born for Kirk, Mount fits the role perfectly. We will be getting a spin-off series dealing with Section 31; I say screw that! Give me a series depicting Anson Mount as Christopher Pike on the Enterprise on his five year mission. That would be great.

Season 2 has however unfortunately taken a dip in quality with writing, pacing and plot. The search for Spock 2.0. The so-called 'Red Angel' which becomes prominent in the plotline is, sorry to say, not that interesting, mainly because the mystery is spread out over so many episodes and it becomes so coy that it borders on tedium. It isn't just that; its the writing, the pacing of it and the decisions from bringing back a certain character to not giving enough screen time for characters that have been there since season 1.

Michelle Yeoh role as former Empress Georgiou now in Section 31 is interesting in small doses. The writing for her is the weakest, cringey and comes off as trying to be comedic and 'hip' but just tends up sounding wrong. Are the writers actually listening/watching the show? Yeoh was great in season 1, for the most part. But things have gone downhill and listening to her delivery those cringey dialogues is almost unbearable. And we're getting a spin-off series that focuses on her and Section 31.

Who thought that was a good idea?

The is the fear that the writers are trying to promote their spin-off series by inserting Section 31 into the plotline as much as possible. I'm starting to feel that slowly creep in. I just hope it doesn't continue on this path.

Overall, Star Trek Discovery, despite a more disappointing season 2, the series is still well worth diving into. From this to the new upcoming Picard series, it's an exciting time to be a trek fan!",10 March 2019
"Too much softy feeling, feeling, feeling, crying and talking when there should be action!",25 May 2019
"ST:TOS and ST:TNG had very clear missions to seek out new worlds and new civilizations. ST:VOY did the same thing out of the necessity of getting forced into that role. That's what brought TREK into Star Trek. What is Discovery's mission? To seek out new clichés and new tropes? To take foolish risks with crew and ship? I watched two episodes and it looks like they are exploring war clichés that have been done to death already. I don't know what they intended to achieve, but I was very bored. I had to fast forward through many scenes.

Star Trek should always be about exploration on one front or another. Orville has gotten it right, in spirit. Discovery discovers nothing.",25 September 2017
"I finally got to watch Star Trek: Michael Burnham, I mean Discovery. I have never seen a Star Trek series that looked so much like a soap opera, with one focal character that is the singular main character which the whole story revolves. The first season looked like it was written by someone who heard that the show was about space, and nothing more. The Klingons kept saying stay Klingon, but were not Klingons themselves, and they had red iron based blood rather than pink as was well established. The second season it looked like they were trying to fix it, but it wasn't until the last episode that the Klingons remembered that ""this looks like a good day to die,"" but it was more like a turn of phrase than a life philosophy of living every day as if it is your last. It still looked like a soap opera, but higher quality, and they were trying to get away from the crap that the first season was. Most of that was by bringing in Pike, and the Enterprise. Over all, it's not up to the quality I would expect, but it looks like CBS found a good way to make money off of a old property. Everyone complaining about the new Star Wars movies, has not seen this crap yet.",15 April 2020
"Discovery provides a very elegant and sweet cover to the era of USS Enterprise. Cast Captain Pike is very authoritative and gives us a deeper understanding of this very important character leading to the era of the legendary Captain Kirk

The music composition at the end of Season 2 makes me sobbed in tears, with a very beautiful music composition, combining modern music composition and classic song Star Trek

I really hope Captain Chris Pike's character can be given a more important role in the upcoming story before entering the era of Captain Kirk

So far, I believe the action and the science in Discovery is represents Gene Roddenberry's vision of Star Trek original.

Only 1 minor, I don't like the Gay/homosexual character Stamets and Culber. The rest I give 9 point but for the Gay story side that's dragging down the scores

One more thing, don't focus only on Michael Burnham! This is STAR TREK not a Michael Burnham TREK! ...sucks",30 September 2019
"Usually, this kind of series would be just my thing, but this is irredeemably mediocre. It's not that the whole show is ""poor"", its more about the huge disparity between the quality of certain elements.

First of all, the design, look and production of the show is absolutely fantastic. Its both gorgeously modern and also keeps plenty of nods to the Star Trek we know and love. Acting is generally pretty decent. Good performances and strong characters right from the start. Where it falls down is character writing and character-driven plot. Martin-Green gives a pretty great performance in the leading role, but it feels like the script, narrative and backstory are all stacked against Michael Burnham being an overall likeable character. There's just too much that doesn't make sense and makes her seem like an embodied plot device who somehow never appears to be wrong about anything. However, I do feel like this show is a good example of diverse casting done for the right reasons! Unfortunately this is not always the case these days. But Discover is on it in the right way. Great actress choice and - if I understand correctly - a deliberate nod to the brilliant cultural impact of Nichelle Nichols' Uhura in ToS. On a similar note, I really like Captain Georgiou!

Tried way too hard to cram in very obvious references to original star trek in places where things are hinted or pointed out so aggressively that it feels patronising at times.

Soundtrack varies between solid, generic and inappropriate. I wouldn't say that any of it is bad - just not always very fitting. Especially the title theme.

Overall, its a bit of fun with some decent action and characters. Storytelling is not always as compelling or believable as it could be; but then it's literally in space with aliens in the future, so who cares!!",3 July 2020
"Season 4 is finally getting to feel like Star Trek, its dealing with topics all the previous shows did, and I like the running story of the DMA.

However they do need to dial back the social commentary somewhat. Im not against any of it, its the most Trek thing to be inclusive and forward thinking, it was right back to ToS, but its being layered on a bit thick.

Its like a CW show and need to realise that sometimes less is more. Have all the gay, trans and ethnic characters you want, but making them so one dimensionally about that is not the way to be inclusive. Why are 2 black characters lovers? Why are 2 gender questioning characters lovers? Thats not actually as progressive as the show runners think it is. In the year 3000+ it really shouldn't be a topic that requires such heavy handling, and yet such safe handling at the same time.",30 December 2021
"I have enjoyed parts of this. If you take it as a cheesy sci fi soap opera it is an OK, middle of the road, something to watch and go along with series. Unfortunately this is a Star Trek that revolves around one character- Michael Burnham, and emotions. Typical episode: 1.Burnham is told not to do something. 2.Burnham knows best and does what she wants. 3.Burnham turns out to be right and saves the day/crew/ship/world. 4.Lots of Burnham - angry crying/barely crying/trying not to cry/grimacing/whispering etc (most one trick pony acting i have seen in a long time) 5. Most of the crew get emotional either with or against Burnham but eventually come to agree with her (I would be concerned with how unstable and inept the crew seem to be for a well trained ""Discovery"" crew, but it is fiction after all!) Does my review contain spoilers? Basically yes, because whatever Burnham does will save the day. Do I hate this? No, as I said right at the start it is OK, but just OK. Do I love it? No, this isn't Star Trek, it holds so much promise, but fails to deliver. 5 stars = very much give or take it. My recommendation - Watch The Orville.",19 December 2020

This is a fresh look at Star trek. I don't agree with some fans saying we should go back to next gen. It was great for the time but like Discovery it changed with the times and was different then the original series. This is just a new look at Star trek. Yes I agree that it should of been set in the 24th centery. I like the edge it's bring to Star trek and loved the first series as well as the 2nd. Star trek about expanding and exploring new ways of thinking and doing things and this Discovery is doing that.,15 March 2019
"I want to give an as unbiased view as possible on this new take on Gene Roddenberry's vision, as a fan and viewer. I feel it's too easy to hate on something that may differ from anything previous.

The first thing I'll say about Star Trek: Discovery is that.... it's different, the second, which I highly recommend any viewer to keep in mind, is NOT to relate it to any previous Trek series (which may be one of the things fans have trouble with) as there is more in common with 'The Undiscovered Country' (the Nicholas Meyer contribution I'm assuming) and the 2009 film (Alex Kurtzman) in tone, feel and events that take place. However I could relate the show in some ways to SyFy's 'The Expanse'.

The production value is simply INSANE, the production design, costuming, visual effects, all film quality standards and though I really didn't like the Klingon aesthetic personally (including make up design) all was stunningly detailed nonetheless.

The other way this show varies is the very singular or narrower perspective of the character dynamic as it focuses mostly on Commander Michael Burnham's story, a smart, yet flawed and her struggles shrouded round Federation/Klingon politics, rather than getting to know a crew and their quirky personalities bar one.

The first two episodes leave you thinking...OO-KKKayy!...what's next so I will be fascinated what's to come.

A good pilot with great potential (needs more crew development). I give this a 7/10",26 September 2017

"It is bad, because it suffers from some poor writing and plotting, and some of the character lack chemistry, and/or acting ability. It has clichés and sometimes stupid character motivation. That is what makes this a weak show.

It is NOT bad because it has women in strong roles, or gay characters, or makes comments on racism or social injustice. Can it be a little heavy handed with its messaging on occasion?...perhaps, but Star Trek has ALWAYS been about such subjects, and was always ""left-wing""

All the anti-woke (which, by the way, essentially means ""unenlightened"") reviewers, down voting this to force their own, antiquated politics, or try to get the show cancelled, should be ashamed of themselves.

But aggressively 1 starring because you can't handle and fear change, is the very antithesis of what Gene Roddenberry stood for. If seeing a woman of colour in a leading role, hurts your fragile masculinity and feeling of white superiority, that is very much a ""YOU"" problem. If seeing gay characters express love for each other, makes you nervous, again, seems like a ""YOU"" problem. If talking about race makes you uncomfortable...""YOU"" problem.

If Roddenverry is spinning in his grave, it's due to the shameless politicised, far-right ""reviews"", rather than the weak TV show bearing his franchise's name, that is causing him to ocilate wildly!!

You guys clearly aren't actual Trek fans, if you think Trek shouldn't include current social issues. Trek was ALWAYS about representation, and social awareness. Did you actually ever watch Trek? Or did you just fail to ""get it""?

And before anyone says ""the old Trek wasn't this PC"". That is because the old Trek was written and produced in the 60's, (which is where some of the 1 Star reviewers mindsets are stuck). So it reflected it's time and it's issues. Just as the 90's next gen did, and so on. It's 2021 folks, try to keep up.

The unfortunately acronymed Star Trek Discovery, isnt a great show. It's just barely watchable, and it doesn't feel like real Star Trek (beyond it's visual design), but it isn't bad because of it's want to tackle social issues. That is the one ""Trek thing"" it gets right.",4 July 2021
"I was excited to see this new invocation of the evolving Star Trek franchise, only grazing over a few reviews before watching. Many said what I have come to concur after forcing myself to finish season two. This show breaks the rules that Gene Roddenberry had for Star Trek and turned this show into a space adventure with heavy soap opera style drama that completely ruins the classic Star Trek vibe in my opinion. Watch season 1 and you'll see great special effects, some good and bad acting with a little taste of the full on drama and focus on emotions and feelings over adventure in season 2. 🍋🍋🍋",22 July 2023

"I remember the days when I was watching Power Rangers on a random TV channel and this TV series reminded me that feeling. The real action happens on 4 locations and all the budgets are pushed in CGI.

I have watched the entire first season and think it is pure drivel.",25 October 2019
"Not entirely bad, but almost a parody of the true Star Trek. All the actors/actresses are phenomenal. The writers need to stay with cannon and ease up on the sjw political correctness bs.

"Took me 4 episodes to really like this ,the first review you see on here well at least when i looked is a hater of the series , i am not a trekky or whatever the real way of saying it is? i like sci fi , i like star wars the last 2 are ok! first 3 are ground breaking ep 1,2.3 are appalling enough said , then there is star trek i grew up watching repeats of the original , then in my 20's next generation which again was nothing we had seen before then ds9 so so , Voyager which is my favourite then im afraid i lost interest tried enterprise but didn't like it, then the reboot of the films came about my ears perked up and they have been great even converted the kids from star wars to star trek fans from the reboot films . So discovery for me brings back some of the writing from the original 66-69 and reminds me of Voyager that was slated and hated when it started ,but grew and grew on me .

Discovery is a modern take on star trek and yes you do have to get with the times but stick with it and it may grow on you , being from Britten i did find to begin with its ""a bit american"" but i got over it and now when the the wife is in bed i get to watch at least 2 episodes before i get in trouble for waking her up as i come to bed ?? . so summary stick with it a bit cheesy american with dubious dialogue but grows on you like a good star trek should . in reality a 7* but my score 9*",16 March 2018
"The story has potential but the acting and characters is serious mess. Too childish overall, too much drama, crying and whispering that ruins what could have been a good Star Trek show. Cause now it clearly isn't up to other Star Trek standards.",16 April 2021
"I was very excited to watch this new TV series, but sorely disapointed and disgusted with it's content!

I didn't really like the cast at all, so never really 'got into' the show from the start. But, I like Star Trek and stuck with it through the entire first season.

My two biggest problems with this show are: (1) The gay kissing. It was bad enough seeing this homo crap on screen once, but it was way WAY too frequent and gross. It really put me off the show. (2) They f-bombed it! Why would they ruin Star Trek with the f-word?! Seriously, that is beyond my comprehension.

Sadly, I think they shouldn't even be allowed to brand this as 'Star Trek' because of the 2 prior-mentioned peeves. And also, it wasn't the proper ""each episode is a unique adventure"" format, but rather one long drawn-out movie spread accross a season.

The violence, gore, swearing and homosexual content are not what I remember seeing in previous Star Trek series. Yes previous series had battles, fights, some basic gore effects, but the level of detail in the Discovery is too graphic. I also remember one single episode of ST-DS9 having a lesbian kiss, which was not to my liking as well, but it was brief and quick.

I feel very sad and let down with this series, and definately will not be continuing to watch future seasons (if they make any).",3 August 2018
"(Review based on seeing episodes up until including season 2, episode 11)

""Science Fiction"" has the word science in it for a reason. Of course, when writing SciFi, you invent some fictional things when initially creating your universe, for example the warp drive and lots of other things. However, once you setup the universe you stick to those mechanics, keep it consistent. You can't just make up random stuff whenever you need it. Yes, occasionally you can add new mechanics, but those always have to be consistent within the universe. You can not change the mechanics of your universe, once established.

Also the rules of the universe have to make sense within themselves. For example a warrior race (Klingons) dressing in very elaborate costumes, which does not only contradict ""facts"" previously established in the older series, but is also entirely unpractical for battle. I could even live with that, but then the authors have to provide a reasonable explanation to the audience, why this is happening in this timeframe.

There are countless examples for this, Discovery those this all the time. The authors seem to write their episodes based on ""Hey, what would be cool?"" and end up destroying the Star Trek universe by creating contradicting facts. Instead they should start with ""Hm, what works within this universe?"" and go from there.

I realize that StarTrek has a long legacy and a very complex universe. And yes, also the older series did not always stick to the consistency of the universe. But the old series did so a lot more respectfully of that legacy. For example the ENT season 4 episode ""In a Mirror, Darkly"", where they discover a Constitution class ship from the future is a great example of how to connect the timelines between the series (and decades of improved special effects) without breaking things.

There are even some examples where Discovery is needlessly inconsistent within itself, sometimes even within one episode (although the latter example is very minor)",7 April 2019
"This show is great. Cant wait to see what happens next in season 3, unfortunately we will have to wait a while before it is released due to the pandemic. I am expecting maybe late fall early 2021. Last least it seem that way. Hopefully earlier. Cant wait to see what happens next.",24 May 2020
"Season 1 = OK start Season 2 (1st Half) = Signs of potential Season 2 (2nd Half) = Perhaps the worst television ever created. I had to force myself to finish this season just so I can finally cancel CBS All Access.

Stop! Stop this now before you destroy a great franchise.",4 August 2019
"I'm absolutely bored of everyone complaining it's not Roddenberry's vision. Well of course it isn't, he doesn't direct or write this show, so, put down your warrior hands, and understand that this is a whole new vision, eve. There are lots of fight scenes, but, there would be in a universe that's as vast as it is.

I love the show and story lines with all the arcs that have been put in place. Is it perfect? Absolutely not, and I'm with the majority on this matter, Michael should not be the focus as she is quite annoying, especially with the constant cry face, turn it in. Christoper Pike who's charismatic should get way more screen time as every scene he was in was way better than just, Michael.

All in all, this is just a solid show with good actors that deserves an 8/10. I find it absolutely ludicrous that Trekkies are so critical and give it a ONE, you should rate it for the show that it is and not what you think it should be from the past. Time to move forward as nobody is looking for ""classic trek"" anymore because it's outdated. If you need ""classic trek"" then watch the old one's along with TNG as they are available, however, for the love of god stop moaning about it and don't watch this show.",25 October 2020

While (and perhaps because of being) handicapped by production techniques of the time, the show was engrossing due to the storytelling.

"*Review on the first 2 seasons* I want to like this show. The bones are mostly there for something great, but through the second season, it's probably the weakest Trek TV entry. I really hope it ""grows the beard,"" and plan to stick with it, but skepticism is definitely outweighing optimism at this point.

Pros:
Mostly great characters (though the writing and dialogue for those characters, not so much). Unlike some of the reviewers, I LIKE the diverse cast and I LIKE Michael Bernham. Get over it.
Strong acting
Great soundtrack


Cons (mostly writing related):


Overall, this show is way Abrams than Roddenberry (or Berman). It has a flashy facade and talks a lot about doing the right thing, but the execution is a mess. It's too bad, because I feel like the raw material is there, but the writing just isn't.",16 April 2020

The doc is ok I guess... and Michael....hmm, mixed feelings. The Emperor was cool but I guess she's gone now.

Anyways the scripts and production values are generally very good and I like the whole idea of them restarting the federation in the future.

"Star Trek has beamed back on two our televisions with the new show: ""Star Trek: Discovery"" It's brought to us by Alex Kurtzman, who producer the new J.J. Abrams Star Trek films. It stars Sonequa Martin-Green as 1st officer Michael Bernhard, who is the first human to graduate from the Vulcan academy. Here the show differs from the other Star trek show by mainly focusing on her character. Luckily Michael Burnham is a interesting character i found my self rooting for. Martin- Green also does a good job in the role. Generally the acting is good, but some actors fail to deliver the dialogue naturally and comes off as pretty bad. This is of course not surprising from a TV-show. As for the story, the show takes place 10 years before the 5 year mission of the enterprise and focuses on the return of the Klingons. In past iterations the Klingons have clearly been a representation of the Soviet union, but in this show they have taken the role of religions extremist of sorts which is a timely up date of the warrior species, although this makes for a much darker Star Trek. And this is one of the negatives. Star Trek has always been about the hopeful future for all of mankind. However this show is taking on the darker approach with heavy themes of war. I'm all for change and perhaps it's just something trekkers will have to adapt to. Perhaps the tone will change, but even If it doesn't there's still is a lot of things to enjoy. The Characters are interesting and it's probably the most beautiful Star Trek show ever. Some other problems you might have is the continuity issues that arise. For an example Klingons look completely different now without hair and this doesn't add up with the other shows in the canon. Also the Technology is just a tad two advanced, but If you can set that a side i think this might become a great Star Trek show. To give the show a fair chance i think you need to see the first two episodes as i did and i find myself intrigued and excited about the upcoming episodes!

"The first season was great, there were a lot of new elements from previous StarTrek with some new twists, graphics obviously increased and an interesting story line! The seasons have gone down hill significantly. This latest season is sooo painful to watch. Every episode just leaves you wanting. I fast forward through a lot of each episode now to the point its not even worth watching anymore. Everyone is such a crybaby on the show. I appreciate the shows inclusiveness, Im gay myself, but come on. It feels so overbearing and overtakes the show and you completely lose the Star Trek. It doesn't flow, its not organic, it feels so forced. The majority of scenes are just so whiney. Why is everyone always so sappy and sad? I love a good moral to a story, but again, its doesn't flow, it feels fake. The writing has just gone down hill and its hard to really like or root for many of the characters. I don't see the show lasting much longer and its sad because this is a franchise that has a HGUE following and your bombing a opportunity to show inclusivity by very poor execution. Yes there are interracial couples in the world, yes there are gay people, yes there are tans people, yes there are women in leadership positions, yes there are black women in leadership positions and we should see more of it in everything produced, but this show makes all the above out to be cry baby basket cases and we don't need 10 diversity life lesions that leave 5 min for the actual plot of the episode. You can still have all the different diversity, you don't need to take that out, it can just be presented more cohesive with the show and more thoughtful. Poor writing, poor execution, ruining an opportunity to show diversity that makes a difference and ruining a beloved franchise at the same time.",30 December 2021
"I've been a Trekkievsnce I was a little girl in 1968.

I have a few problems with STD. Firstly those Klingons. I had no idea that the pale Klingon was a woman until the second to last episode. And the faces of the Klingons didn't move when they spoke. Why oh why did they change the look of the Klingons? It doesn't make sense to me. And why couldn't the Klingons just speak English? Having subtitles under the grunting of Klingons talking mostly about stuff that didn't really give added value to the plotline was just annoying. By the fourth episode I fast forwarded through them. Secondly, every time someone referred to 'Michael' for a second I thought they were referring to a male character. Thirdly, Where the other shows had fun banter between characters, STD's comic relief was that nervous, stuttering red haired lady. And she was more annoying than comic. Fourthly, the one long storyline. It's like the writers could only come up with a storyline for one episode and stretched it out. And last but not least, the technology. It's over the top for a prequel.

IF this series was to take place 250 years after Voyager, then the technology would make sense and perhaps even the stiff faced ugly Klingons. It would also explain why this Star Trek doesn't fit it at all with the 51 year old Star Trek canon that we Trekkies know and love...

The problem is that the pendulum has now swung so far over to the other side that I think they need a Deanna Troi to come in a soak up all the tears and deal with all the breakdowns. I was actually getting into a good groove with the show and then Episode 8 came along and it was just awash with characters breaking down. It also did not help that the story itself was not very good and lacked any real forward momentum.

"I glanced through about the first 30-40 reviews from start, what surprises me is that about 90% of ALL those are 1-star ratings. Still the average rating is quite high, which puzzles me.

For starters. I personally do not have any problems what so ever about the technology issues. Ie. complaining about holograms etc. I mean come on, TOS had a minimal budget and it was filmed during the 60's. When it comes to technology they more or less had to ""invent"" stuff. Today we are incredibly much more advanced than then.

It's one thing to remain loyal to the earlier series, but come on guys...should we go back to like ships hanging down in threads etc? This is why TOS is imho quite painful to watch nowadays. Everything just looks cheap, the series lives because it's other qualities (cast, plot, excitement and so on). It would be stupid if they felt obligated to use tools invented in the 60's TOS.

I won't go further on with this, i honestly think the show looks extremely good. The details are fantastic etc.

For me personally i have about the same impression as a majority of all other reviewers. The cast is fairly weak, but even worse the plot is honestly quite boring. I am currently watching S02E14, or rather ""listening"" to it while typing this. I just felt i had to release some pressure. Commander Burnham is one of the most annoying characters i can think of...like ever...I mean wth? She is a former captain and now a commander, raised in a vulcan manner. And still, she is the most vulnerable, weak person i have ever seen. I swear, she has watery eyes in like 90% of ALL episodes. Either that or she has a dramatic scene (well, most are like this) where she is crying.

The cast is fairly bad. Few characters are interesting at all. Pike, Saru, Georgiou and some few others are all ok. The majority is just incredibly uninteresting and boring. Some few are for me also incredibly annoying (Tilly, Stamets, Burnham and some others).

The show seems to focus on being annoyingly politically correct (ie. sexuality, i have nothing against that but when it becomes a major issue in a Sci-Fi series i am OUT). The characters are incredibly selfish in a way (me myself and i).

Finally the plot. It is just so uninteresting. All other ST shows have been about exploration and interacting with interesting species. Now it is just a really bad drama imho. And as so many others have also pointed out. ST-series are kind of famous for having small messages, learn from what happens. Not in STD. It's just watery Burnham eyes, crap scripts and constant explosion and dramatic (bad) music.

I see almost nothing in common with all other ST-shows.",17 May 2019

"Not much to say other than it's overly dramatic and there are so many dumb one liners. At one point Mr spock states, ""I like science."" I get the messaging but come on, it's spock! It's also just super cheesy. Characters are under the gun constantly working on supposedly difficult problems but are almost always figuring them out instantly because there's always someone who magically has a revelation. Then while they are implementing said super complicated solution they are casually working on it while dealing with some personal issue in the process. Emotional crisis is interwoven into everything; as I said, super dramatic. But the casualness of the work compared to the focus on the personal issues of the character just seems off. Andd many issues are over dramatized and somewhat unbelievable, hence the cheese factor.",21 November 2020

Then came Enterprise which I really got into. I loved the realism and story(s). I was even sad to see it go.

Discovery is a different beast altogether. Every episode is beautifully shot and put together. It's not just the amazing CGI or the sets and costumes, but the story and the way the cast piece it all together and immerse us, the watchers in it.

"There are disappointing structures in many modern science fiction projects. A grievous one in this series has two women running a large star ship like they were raising kittens. The have a male figure that they insult on a regular basis. When they confront a problem the four hundred or more people on the ship are irrelevant. The captain & first officer make decisions by playing rock-paper-scissors. The series is hanging on this structure. In the first episode the Klingons are stupid as fence posts. The main characters are different shades of white people and the Klingons are clearly black people. The plot points are arbitrary & do not make sense in a general way. To me this is not evolved thinking, but is a vehicle for graphics and puerile excitement.",29 September 2020
"I would give it an 8, but it loses two points just for being streaming only. If they would even delay broadcast a week or two I wouldn't mind, but a show of this caliber and this fan base should not be hidden behind a paywall.

I also, after having given it six episodes, have come to the conclusion as many have that no matter what the rabid fans (I can count myself as one having seen every episode of every other series at least once) want to believe, thus far this isn't Trek in any incarnation I've seen before. It doesn't seem to follow any of the philosophy that Gene laid out and it doesn't seem to care much about what has come before it in a canonical way. Characters do things I wouldn't expect to see in the trek universe. The technology doesn't fit with the time period as laid out in previous series. The alien races don't fit.

Again... I like the series. It keeps the viewer engaged and it has good story lines. I will definitely continue to watch it, but... It just doesn't seem to have the heart and soul of Star Trek.",24 October 2017

"Background: I've been a fan of Star Trek for 27 years.

But first, I want to give my take for non-fans who are just wondering if this is a show that's worth watching:

So far, it's adventurous, futuristic, exciting and already has me waiting to see where it goes. The ship, crew and world-building are well-done so far. If you enjoy scifi stories, you should definitely check this out.

---

For Trek fans:

Star Trek is back on TV, and I'm excited!

It's only been 2 episodes, so it's hard to judge a lot so far, but I wanted to write because I know the 1st season of almost every Trek series has been a bit dodgy, and this one already shows a lot of promise.

""Why are we fighting? We're Starfleet. We're explorers, not soldiers.""

(Some slight info from the episode present ahead, but nothing I'd call a 'spoiler.' Still, if you're very sensitive to that, watch the episode before reading.)

First off, this is the first time I've found the Klingons interesting. They already have an actual culture and backstory presented that shows them as more than a one-note battle-obsessed biker gang in space. (This is an old beef of mine, and I already feel like they're addressing it.)

I enjoyed watching the Vulcan-raised human show emotion but then slide into Vulcan training. She's like the opposite of Spock, who sometimes showed glimpses of emotion behind his wall of logic. For Michael, logic sometimes reins in her emotions in times of stress, and you see it happen in her face and mannerisms.

The ships and visuals borrow from the JJ-verse and appear more futuristic than TOS, but I think that's definitely the right move. A retro series just wouldn't work in 2017, as much as many of us would dig that. This looks like the future of our time, as TOS did in the 60s.

I will be watching every week. I want to see it grow into one of the great series of this historic franchise, and like all of the series since TOS, I'll give it that chance. So far, I'm very optimistic about where it's heading.",24 September 2017

"I'm a long time fan of Star Trek but I struggled to sit through this badly scripted mess, melodramatic monologues expressing the emotional feelings of each character every few minutes made this exhausting to watch, had to force myself to watch the last few episodes, ever second scene someone is crying and having an emotional epiphany.

"I was so excited for this I almost subscribed to the channel just for this show. Then CBS offered a free 30 day trial and I jumped on it. Hoo-boy am I glad I didn't pay for this dreck!

This is Star Trek in name only. As others have pointed out it has none of the intelligent writing of the past series. There are so many ""nail-biting"" nick-of-time moments every episode that it becomes tedious rather than exciting or suspenseful.

I'm forcing myself to watch it in the hopes that it gets better, but it doesn't. I just finished an episode in the middle of season 2 where they kill off a character with much weeping and drama from the crew...but is the audience supposed to care? We've been told nothing about this character for a full season and a half, then you kill her...and it's just a big ""so what.""

If you like constant fight scenes, explosions, and nonsense with brief breaks for over-the-top soap opera drama, then I guess this show is for you.

I gave it two stars for production value, which is very sharp. Other than that this is complete garbage. It must sell to the more ""basic"" crowd considering the overall rating here, but I wish you all had just made another Fast and Furious movie and left this beloved franchise alone. :/",18 April 2020

No matter what idea they have for a plot each week they always manage to make the episodes mind-numbingly tedious. You care nothing about what is happening or any of the characters.

"Who approved this crap? This is not Star Trek, at all.

1). Why another prequel. Star Trek is about having an optimistic future, not having a pessimistic past.

2). Why set this show 100 years in the future from the Star Trek the Next Generation era. This way all the new special effects can be used, and be a continuation of what was, instead of a total undoing of what was.

3). Why change the Klingons? They look, act, and speak differently from all previous Klingons. Since Star Trek the Motion Picture, the definition of a Klingon has been established. Why change now? If you want to have an alien race that is like these Klingons, leave the Klingons alone and creat an all new aliens race.

4). Star Trek was always character driven, with the SiFi stuff as the background. This show has it backward. This show the special effects are from and center, with the character interaction as the background.

5). The science in Star Trek was based in reality. With few exceptions the technology they had was plausible, even if we don't have it yet. I remember the original series as a kid, pretty much everything they had we either have today or it's already bout dated. This show is pure science fiction, which is not Star Trek.

6). Spores Drive. Come on, are we to believe in the future we will have mushroom propelled space ships capable of hyper-warp. Who ever thought of this must have been on mushrooms. LOL.

Star Trek Discovery is not a 10/10 TV series, its probably a good 8, but as a counterweight to all those little haters (also seen in the Carshow ""Top Gear"") who cannot adapt to the time we live in i have to give it a 10.",23 October 2017
"Let's firstly cast aside these ideas of 'true' Star Trek fans or 'purists' and look at how this series stands on its own rather than how it fits into the pre-existing plethora of canon.

From the offset, the double bill opener to Discovery sets the chess pieces on the board and lets the audience know what the series will be all about. It doesn't shy away from it's namesake and does not pander to the wider audience; it is created for fans of Star Trek first and foremost. The set design and effects are almost thrust in your face within the first 10 minutes of the pilot, and they deliver. You couldn't falter the production values here, and you can see that a great attention to detail has been adhered to on each set piece.

The main characters were established early on and whilst it is very early in the show to be casting judgement, there were pieces of dialogue which felt a little forced, and delivery of those lines followed suit. This however, is common for many new shows' opening acts.

The double bill acts as a sort of prologue to the forthcoming series, highlighting the ideology of both The Federation and The Klingon Empire. After watching, you have a very clear picture of what everyone will be fighting for and why; the show tells us exactly what to expect with no pretence, and that is commendable in a world of TV with sub-text behind every line and a new arch every week.

Overall, take away the name Star Trek from the title and you could easily get into a groove of watching this show weekly; it stands up there with the likes of The Expanse or even Battlestar Galactica with its modern aesthetic and dramatic story telling. But how does it hold up when we consider its place in the Star Trek universe?

If you're here, and you're reading this then you are curious as to what the fan base thinks about this series. And you will also have noticed that many of these reviews are overwhelmingly negative. It's easy to see why some fans have had this reaction, to a certain extent.

let's get the purple elephant in the room out of the way first: The Klingons.

OK, they do NOT look like the Klingons we are used to, in any iteration, but that is the point; there is more than one pre- existing iteration of Klingons around. For me, as much a Star Trek fan as the next poster, I could not give a flying duck that they look different. When you really read what people say about this issue though, the only real negative observation is that ""they aren't Klingons"". Whereas those who defend the changes will say things like ""They looked different in TOS."" ""There were genetic changes made to them after this in the time-line. "" etc. The real fact of the matter is, it does not make one. bit. of difference. If the internet was around when The Next Generation introduced Klingons, I imagine the outcry would have been exactly as vocal as now.

And this rather forms the main point regarding the other issues people have with this show, or any show for that matter, or any film, album, news broadcast, celebrity, website, company, corporation, government, etc. Everyone has an opinion, and the internet is where these opinions can now easily unite. The power of the online mob is much stronger now than ever before, the online community can literally make or break anything it gets it's hands on; and that is bad news for any institution like Star Trek who wishes to breathe new life into something so many treasure.

The fans are divided, and will most likely remain so throughout the duration of this shows airtime. There's no Kelvin universe to hide behind here, Discovery has it rough, they have to stay as faithful as they can to the canon, whilst ensuring that the visuals and technology shown makes as much sense in this time-line as possible (and still look vibrant and glossy) and at the same time, write new stories for new characters within a very narrow window of unexplored time and story.

It was never going to be easy, but they have indeed managed to get it right. It is not a watered down soap opera in space, nor is it without lighter moments or intense drama. It very aptly balances what modern viewers have come to expect from programming.

Crucially, it doesn't box itself in by pandering to every potential gripe people may have with the 'liberties' taken. Star Trek HAS to evolve to survive; modern entertainment demands require things to look nice and shiny, the story to be deep and over-arching through a season, and the creator's should be praised to being able to bring back a well loved franchise from the ether and offer it up to a younger, modern audience in a package which has some of the best elements of earlier series (subject to personal taste) and some of the best modern sprinklings to boot.

I could write for hours about this, but it all comes down to personal choice in the end, and personally, I am very glad to have Star Trek back on the silver screen and I am hopeful that it will continue to deliver some compelling Sci-fi for many seasons to come.",26 September 2017
"For all those so called Trek fans out there with the negative reviews...you can stick your dated linear scripts and your Fluffy multi-coloured Tribbble stories into a very large black hole far far away.

A glimpse into a future filled with endless wonder and excitement. The Character building has been progressive and well executed by both the writers and actors.

"Sonequa Martin-Green playing the lead role Michael Burnham is really a very bad actress simply because she is not credible at all in her role as Michael Burnham and her acting always seem not genuine, false in many ways. Consequently, it makes this TV series not as good as it could have been with a much better lead role than the one played by Sonequa Martin-Green.

Having said that, if we turn a blind eye on this awful actress Sonequa Martin-Green, this TV series is even better than the previous Star Trek series. Probably because the special effects are really very good, the story is interesting and the actors are in general really good except for the lead role played by this awful (not genuine at all) actress Sonequa Martin-Green.

Highly recommended, especially for those who like science fiction TV series.",19 May 2019

"Started off strong, with the best CGI yet in a Star Trek-Spinoff. Seasons 1 and 2 were okay, after that it deteriorated: week storyline, unplausible character-development, esoterical humble-mumble replacing physics (or an idea what to do with cast and story).

The writers obviously got so stranded in the first storyline that they had to catapult Discovery into a whole new setting. Reeks of desparation. But what I find most hard to bare: Everybody now is almost always on the verge of crying. Michael most of the time looks into the camera just like Mary Ingalls did in Little House on the Prairy: Always either suffering or sympathetic with somebody who suffers. All adventure is lost in esoterics and psychosocial caretaking. This is not Star Trek.",18 December 2020

That said, i fear that Discovery misses some of the basics in StarTrek, it is a franchise that primary is about exploring, not war. Some reviewers said its too much Star Wars, i tend to agree.

But the 4th episode showed some potential, so i hope for the better.",13 October 2017
"I really wanted to like this show. the looks are great and is probabbly the bigger budget Star Trek show ever.

I just so.. superficial. so flat.. so empthy there's no soul into this project.

It's one, very sad, missed opportunity",5 October 2019
"So new Star Trek isn't nearly as bad as a lot of reviewers here would have you believe.

Sure, the writers may have taken some liberties with the back story. Utopia is a thing to fight for and not already achieved in the current year this series is set in, 10 years before TOS.

Moving on, there are some good performances to be seen here, Burnham the lead is acted reasonably well as is Lorca by non other than Jason Isaacs aka Lucius Malfoy. The other acting is generally good too, nothing to roll your eyes at here.

Humour is also present subtly and in small doses, certainly not to the extent of some of the previous series, which is probably a good thing.

Having watched the first eleven episodes I can say that the story is engaging it's too early really to criticise the personalities of some of the characters or their moral compass, as I feel the show is still exploring them as individuals.

How does it compare to other Science Fiction offerings available? Favourably I'd say. I'd rate it better than most other modern Sci-Fi series.

Are there any negatives? Well as you can see from a lot of the other reviews a lot of people aren't happy. The bone of contention seems to be the show being modernised and differences from Gene Roddenburys vision, in response to that I'd say it needed modernising to survive, look at Enterprise.

This is just about one character doing everything, she leads, she fights, she cures people, she understands every science puzzle like no one, so all other people surrounding her are just extras! For instance, last season Captain Pike hung on her lips for every word she said. This year she can enter in a sacred pool (in the Trill episode), like she is the most expert on Trill culture in the entire universe! This is really starting to be annoying!

It just feels like the entire premise of the show, especially the Spore Drive is flawed and this series and narrative is a result of that initial mistake. The characters are just so incredibly annoying and childish with their emotions as well. The command structure is now a joke and don't get me started on Silly Tilly.

It's really a shame that any ST reboot should put its viewers in such a position. This same ask was made of us with other reboots. The first few episodes of TNG were almost unwatchable. Enterprise was only marginally better. It's a ridiculous game to play given all the available source material to work from. It seems a fair bit of overthought and overreach have already boxed in this presentation. And looking to Mudd and/or the Mirror universe makes me even more skeptical about how things will turn out. The absurd scenario of Michael knocking out the captain really shattered my hopes. But I did like the homage to Max Headroom with Sarek's hologram (in other words, it was laughable).

If you love Star Trek and if you are fan of SF genre this is right choice for you. Don't believe previous reviews because they sound like coordinated attempt to diminish this actually great show. The show has all that is in substance Star Trek except in some part visuals which is now contemporary and modern and bring Star Trek into future. I'm glad creators of this show didn't copy previous shows because that would be expected and boring. Star Trek need to evolve and not remain at the same level forever.

"Racism: Star Trek: ""Let That be your Last Battlefield"". Alternate Sexuality: Star Trek Next Generation: ""The Outcast"" and ""The Host"". Environment: Star Trek Deep Space Nine: ""Little Green Men"". Cooperation with those who believe differently than you: almost every Star Trek Voyager episode and the list can go on, but these are just off the top of my head.

However, Star Trek Discovery while trying to follow the tradition of Star Trek being a voice/vehicle for social commentary, has done so with no subtlety whatsoever. It is clumsy in its writing, forced in its execution, and spends more time on caring about feelings then actually getting the job done. Also, it seems bent on teaching us that there are differences in people (who knew?) and all must be embraced.

What they seem to be forgetting is that most people (at least most of the people I know) don't care if someone is straight, gay, trans, non-binary. We DO care about the kind of person someone is on the inside. Are they kind or cruel? Almost any other personality trait will be based on the answer to that question. While I applaud the inclusion of non-traditional sexuality choices in the cast and characters ... it's beyond none of my business with whom one has intimate relations, how they choose to wear their hair, if they choose traditional gender-based clothing selections or wear whatever comes to mind the person chosen to represent a character in a show should fit, and while I am dismayed with the writing and presentation style turn this series has taken, I can agree with most of the casting choices.

I also agree with the uniform choices. Everyone wears a uniform that seems to be utilitarian and not gender based and that includes the footwear. Only the character Saru seems to walk like a model (I read somewhere that's intentional) because his feet seem to be based on an equine of some sort. I like all the different species, and how the species we've already met in one series or another have evolved.

The writers of the last two seasons seem to think that the lessons learned should be presented with a VERY heavy hand the actual story part of the script be treated as an after-thought.

I understand there will be at least one more season, let's hope we get some new writers (or at least some awareness in the current writers), folks with a clue would be nice.",22 April 2022

Almost every Asperger syndrome human felt at home, with the lack of emotions of Spok, the Borg. the anguer of the Klingons. An utopic future of cience and exploration which whe could identify ourselfs.

This is a soap opera. whe dont whant to know who goes in bed with whom.

Whe whant exploration and science.

!!!!! THIS IS NOT STAR WARS.!!!!!",15 December 2020
"Simply awful. OMG. Not sure what this is. A soap opera in space? Instead of calling it STD, they should call it ST Another World.

And why is the story line all based based around one character who constantly speaks in low whispers? Terrible acting! Terrible storyline. So many timeline inconsistencies. Can't watch this anymore...",1 April 2019
Sorry that i see only BOOM AND AGAING BOOM. where is that little smart talcking.. Asking... Where is here Startrek?,2 May 2019
"Season 3 was decent and I look forward to Season 4. But I still give the series as a whole a 1 star due to the blasphemy of previous seasons. I am talking about their complete disregard of Star Trek cannon. They start to make up for this a little Season 3.

Even though I like season 3 I still get annoyed with all the crying Michael Burnham scenes.",24 October 2021
"I have to say, i am surprised it is not the JJ Crap i expected. It is visually a really joy. It is not fair, that 10% of the voters here, gave it just 1 point! They just gave it 1 point to damage the rating. Poor choice! This Series is a modern approach to a Star Trek i love. Discoery is for an bigger audience, but it keeps the heart and the idea of star trek! And I am a hardcore Star Trek Fan (besides the JJ Movies)",16 November 2017
"I'm gonna keep this short, it's a good series especially if you a Star Trekie. It has adventure, romance, thrill, but season three is a little cheesy and over dramatic. Now if your into that, that's fine but if your not, stay away.",8 November 2020
"I wanted badly to support this show so that there be a Star Trek. And here we are in the third season. Yesterday I watched S03E01. Guess what ? If you paid me to describe it and narrate the scenes I could not. I remember only people running around, fighting for no evident reason. I can narrate tons of episodes from TOS (not that old but still watched it, it is better) , OMG the TNG and all and even Enterprise. But this? Michael overplaying every emotion to the extent to be laughable at. Not a single character to earn audience respect to be accepted as savior of the galaxy. Or is this a kids movie now or maybe a dark comedy of the kind. There are now splendid shows that one can watch and I do not know whether I can recommend ST Discovery any longer.",29 September 2017
"I was a skeptic, having grown up with TNG, DS9, and Voyager. I didn't think this was Trek from the trailers, and I went into it expecting to absolutely hate it. I was wrong. Completely wrong. I am absolutely blown away by the characters and the special effects. I think Roddenberry would approve. Give this a try before you post a one star review.",21 October 2017
"Four stars for the season 1 and two for the 2nd.

I loved the action and how the storyline moved forward fast and almost flawlessly in the first season. However, as soon as you start season 2, you can feel that there is too much insincere ego-stroking theatrical American talk and sappy & whiny relationship between the characters.

After noticing it, I thought there might have been some changes in the production and it turned out to be correct. I strongly believe production and writing should be handled by separate people so that the ""four-eyes"" rule can work properly. Sorry to say it but Kurtzman was a good writer only until there was nobody to check on his work.",5 August 2020
"Star Trek Universe is a dream about healhy dociety, about strong, clever people. It's genre is utopia. And that is beautiful! We want see the adventures of these people, to compare ourselves with them. ""Honor"" is a main word! Personal problems are secondary to ship's (station's) needs. But ""Discovery"" is another universe. We are buried under the heap of personal problems, fears, tears... Where are the honor, adventures, love to all life forms? Where the good humour, the happy ends? ST Universe is not the place for showing the imperfection of the world.

3 stars for concept artist's work. 1 for Jason Isaaks' acting and 1 for Anson Mount's Pike, who was the only character from real ST.",24 August 2020
It might be good if you have never watch star trek before and enjoy a style of drama that bares no resemblance to previous treks. They should have just picked an unrelated time line instead of building on an already established and cherished one.,3 April 2019
The last Star trek I enjoyed was the voyager... Since then we go backwards and backwards and even more backwards... And that's not enough. They keep destroying 50 years of history. I really miss an original star trek movie or series... Couse that's garbage...,31 March 2019
"The best series ever of Star Trek!!! Story 10, Fx 10!!!!!",18 October 2020
"I have to say, this seemed like total garbage when I watched the first few episodes. So bad in fact I didn't watch anymore and was quite gutted because like all of us I had been looking forward and hoping for a new ST series for years!

This week though, bored, I decided to give it another go.

I am glad I did, yes there are annoying aspects to this series, things that are incredibly annoying and ridiculous but as it went on I have to admit I did say to myself this is amazing!

I have just finished episode 14 and yes I have frowned more than a few times in this journey up to now and I have thought wtf more than a few times but it is ok and it is ST!

Granted it is a weird version of ST, I am not interested in love stories or being pc (our current day version of pc), in the ST universe that goes without saying, and we do not need to be force fed what we already know about the ST universe.

I hope the glimpses of greatness will be more focused on and the stupidity will forgotten.

I will defiantly be watching the next season.

I haven't written a review on IMDB for literally years and had to set up a new account to write this review for the benefit of other ST fans who might have written this off as garbage in the beginning like I did!

Watch it! Its ok and it could turn into something great!!

EDIT:

Having said the above, watching the next season is so cringeworthy I can't bare to watch another minute of it.

Changing original 8/10 to 3/10",7 September 2018
Star Trek was an amazing family show. I watched all the previous Star Trek shows and movies with my family. Star Trek inspired a lot of children to become creative tax paying adults. We do not need an R rated version of Star Trek. Shame on you!,21 December 2020
"My low 5 star rating is because of the technology. They have more technology than the original series, which doesn't fit because this is supposed to take place 10 years before the original with Captain Kirk.",14 January 2019
"I kept feeling like they were trying to do a forced social commentary and it got old fast.

The sub-titles with the Klingons were annoying and not required and I had a hard time understanding what the Captain was saying most of the time.

No character stood out but the acting was sufficient. The effects were excellent and the action quite good.

I think it's worth watching additional episodes.",25 September 2017
"When I heard that there was going to be a new Star Trek series, I was excited. I had a hard time finding any info for it, online, as to when this series fit into the Trek timeline. I thought it was a future time frame. The technology in the show, looks so futuristic, and does not fit well, at all, for a prequel. Spore driven jump drive, does not fit the warp drive timeline. This would have been better set as a sequel, a century or 2 into the future, where the Klingons suffered some kind of disease, which changed their look, and had them in line for extinction. Then, because the Federation would not help or could not help, with their medical issues, the Klingons broke away from the Federation, aiming to take them over, because they were severly angered with the Federation. I watched the whole first season and the last episode twice, because I was confused about Discovery in contact with Enterprise. The creators, writers and casting director are going to have to tread very carefully, with season 2, as the Enterprise crew are all going to have to be very young actors, as they were in the prequel movies.",3 March 2018
"Crying every 5 min is very irritating and the writing is quite bad, sometimes is predictable. I feel they don't deserve to call this show Star Trek unfortunately.",19 December 2020
"Great visuals and good storyline.. would really love this series... BUT ... its pretty annoying at the time.. can't watch it for long... why telling story with just one character who even don't fit in that timeline!!!!... (M. Burnham)... All emo dramas, staring and scaring everyone and all that biggg boring speechs... Seriously ... Volcuns raised her to punish humans XD XD....!!!! I find saru the most interesting and balanced character .. if the story follow through him it will be more interesting and less annoying...

It simply proves still, after soo so many years no one can beat the Startrek Enterprise ( original Captain Kirk.)...",5 December 2020
"Do you remember when Star Trek presented a future universe that you'd want to experience for yourself? Space was an exciting place to explore. Diplomacy was a legitimate way to solve a problem. Sure, Klingons were savage, but they had honor.

I don't recognize this Star Trek. There's lots of good in it (Saru and Tilly are always welcome on-screen), but it's really hard to get into. I've watched two seasons now, and I still don't really know who half of the bridge crew are, even though they're on-screen enough that I feel like I'm supposed to care about them. Michael Burnham is interesting enough, and very smart, but after having her one big mistake in the pilot, seems to now be infallible.

I don't know. People seem to like it. But it's not for me. Fortunately, there are many other episodes of other Star Trek series that will still scratch that itch for me.",30 May 2019
Unfortunately season 3 is a big disappointment. So boring without a clear plot but rather slow non-interesting compared to season 1 & 2,18 December 2020
"More Trek is good Trek and this show is good. Great acting and nice job finding a niche in the cannon, to make more Trek is awesome.",6 October 2018
"I've seen six episodes of season 1 and this may be the worst Star Trek series made. Here are the reasons:

First, whoever heard of a Star Trek series where the captain of the ship is not the main character? The main character here, Michael, is a mutineer? Say what? Even Spock of TOS, who was arguably the most interesting character, was not the main character. On the other hand, look at the abysmal Star Trek: Enterprise series. After a few episodes, it became clear the commander, T'Pol was the most interesting character. Scott Bakula as the captain was ok, but he was second fiddle in screen presence and character development. The series went downhill from there. Perhaps Michael will become captain of the Discovery later in the series and all of this will be considered background? A waste of time, if so. Poor story design.

Second, and most important critique: When will Hollywood get it through their head a successful series MUST have strong and positive characters. TOS, TNG, Voyager all had this. This is not true for just the Star Trek series, but look at other TV series that are/were very successful. To name a few: NCIS, NCIS-LA, any of the several David E. Kelleys series, Hill Street Blues. Now look at the bad Star Trek series: Enterprise and DS9. I already alluded to this above for Enterprise. In DS9 Odo was the only interesting character. Sisko was boring, partly because the actor couldn't act. And then you had the idiot, Quark, who was neither strong nor positive. So for Discovery, Michael is the only strong and likable character. The Discovery captain is a boorish and arrogant egotist. Who would want to serve under him as captain? Saru, the lieutenant commander, is petty and jealous, not sterling qualities for a Starfleet officer. The cadet who is Michail's roomie is a blabbering idiot, even though she is nice. The scientist/engineer is a bit of a cocky a__hole. The doctor seems ok, but certainly not something you would write home about. Finally, the Admiral, who sleeps with the captain...now that's classy and a great example of strong, moral behavior. What a mess! Great writing is extremely important, but without strong, likable characters, the viewer will lose interest fairly quickly, It is worth noting that is why most of David E. Kelley's series were so successful..they had strong and positive characters AND great writing.

Third, what happened to each episode being its' own story? Gene Roddenberry kept it simple. Each episode was a different story as a morality play. With Discovery, each episode is a play off the one plot line: the Klingon war and how Michael is going to fit in. Sure, TOS always had the general mission of exploring and finding new alien life forms. But each episode was its own story with a moral subtext. The viewer couldn't wait to tune in each week to see what new adventure was going to happen. TNG extended this. Voyager did basically the same, only they were trying to get home. The landmark Rod Serling science fiction series, The Twilight Zone, used this approach a few years earlier with tremendous success. And what is this running Klingon story that is constantly showing up? Who cares? This is a ""Star Trek"" series, not, ""The Klingons"". Also, the Klingons are not very positive characters (see Second reason, above). Again, what a mess this series is.

Finally, where did this Spore-drive come from? I don't remember this ever being mentioned in any of the ""future"" Star Trek series. Did you just decide to pull this out of the air for dramatic purposes? Pretty lazy. I can only guess this portends failure for this method of travel later in the series, which would then explain why no other series bothered to mention it.

The only good thing about Discover is the special effects, but that should be a given in this decade. So no real congrats here.

I will probably end up watching the rest of season one hoping it will get better, but I'm not optimistic.",6 November 2020
"It was typical ST and I enjoyed it. The big problem was the Klingons. Those guys seemed to be having trouble speaking the language. They talked so slow and muffled by the big fake teeth. The makeup looked weird and to me not very good. I hope it gets better. I am sure with time it will. I did not really like TNG till the third season, so I have hope. The only problem is, I am not paying for CBS access. Guess I will watch it next year.",24 September 2017
"There are positives and negatives to this series. On the positive side, it gives more background and history into the Klingon beliefs and culture. Something I always felt was missing from the other series. It has introduced some new aliens into the mix. And let's face it, a new series was way over due. It's a prequel series which I have felt would be cool, but I feel they should have gone back to the first warp flight, meeting of the Vulcans, and the founding of Starfleet.

On the negative side though, the ship (Discovery), although looking cool makes no practical sense in design. The Klingons are goofy cartoony demon looking characters. They do not leave the Klingon translations on the screen all the time long enough to read it all. It is way darker than anything before it with violence, hate, war, and cruelty, which leads me to believe there will be a plot twist somewhere that indicates it takes place in a mirror universe. The tech in Discovery well surpasses anything from the other series and movies, which makes the series feel more like a reboot than a new prequel series (which would be a mistake). The Discovery has a ""spore drive"" which (to my knowledge) was never mentioned or even hinted at in other series or movies that sounds an awful lot like a transwarp drive (mentioned in Voyager, set hundreds of years in the future from this series) and deemed impossible.

My biggest annoyance thus far is the lack of the universal translator and having to read the Klingon parts",26 October 2017
"Season 1 and 2 are pretty good.

Season 3 is not so hot. Parts seem like a Game of Thrones rip-off.

I will wind up watching the 1st 3 season in less than 1 week.",15 January 2021
"My Japanese style English is very bad, please let me comment. Star Trek had the brightness of entertainment and the depth of logic. This new StarTrek world is dark meaninglessly. The story is hilarious, there are also impossible to set up people, lacking logic.

However, at the moment only Episode 2 of Season 2 was a beautiful and fun Star Trek world. I want you to continue making stories on that line. I expect in the future.",12 February 2019
"If you liked Enterprise and Game of Thrones and thought they should combine. this is for you.

Beyond the abandonment of cannon and twisted morality, the main problem is its so utterly joyless.

It is just so joyless. Its suffering, sorrow and regret looping over and over.",12 December 2017
